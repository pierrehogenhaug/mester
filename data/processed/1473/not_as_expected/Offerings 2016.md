# Hanesbrands Finance Luxembourg S.C.A.
## % Senior Notes due 2024 Guaranteed by Hanesbrands Inc.

Hanesbrands Finance Luxembourg S.C.A., a newly-formed corporate partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par actions)
incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the “Issuer”), is offering €450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of %
Senior Notes due 2024 (the “notes”). The Issuer will pay interest on the notes on and of each year, commencing,
2016. The notes will mature on, 2024.

Prior to, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the notes), the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole”
premium. In addition, on or after, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the notes), the Issuer may redeem all or a
portion of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax
law.

If we experience specific kinds of changes in control and a ratings downgrade, the Issuer must offer to purchase the notes. See “Description of
Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event.”

The notes will initially be guaranteed (the “guarantees”) on a senior unsecured basis by Hanesbrands Inc. (the “parent guarantor”) and certain
of its subsidiaries (the “subsidiary guarantors” and, together with the parent guarantor, the “guarantors”) that guarantee our Euro Term Loan
Facility (as defined below) and, in the future, by each of the parent guarantor’s subsidiaries that guarantee certain material debt facilities of the
Issuer or the guarantors or certain material debt securities issued by the Issuer or the guarantors. The notes will be the Issuer’s senior
unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior debt and senior in right of
payment to any subordinated debt the Issuer may incur. The notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s existing and future
secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. The guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with the
applicable guarantors’ existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to any subordinated debt that guarantor may incur. In
addition, the notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The validity and enforceability of certain of the guarantees and liability of certain of the guarantors will be subject to the limitations described
in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.” The guarantees may be released
under certain circumstances.


There is currently no public market for the notes. We expect to submit an application to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to admit the notes to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market (the “Euro MTF Market”). The
Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market within the meaning of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments. There are no
assurances that the notes will be admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market.

_See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in the_
_notes._


**Offering Price:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from** **, 2016**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other
place. Unless they are registered, the notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. We and the initial purchasers named below are offering the notes only to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan
of Distribution.”


The notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more global notes in registered form. On their issue date, the global notes will be
deposited and registered in the name of a nominee for a common depositary of Euroclear SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking,
_société anonyme (“Clearstream”)._

We expect that the delivery of the notes will be made to investors in book-entry form on or about, 2016.

**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**

This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor
provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of
words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “aim,” “strive,” “believe,” “project,” “predict,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “will,” the negative of
these terms and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among
others, statements we make regarding: guidance and predictions relating to expected operating results; strategic
actions, including acquisitions and dispositions, anticipated benefits from strategic actions, and our success in
integrating acquired businesses; anticipated levels of capital expenditures in future periods; our belief that we
have sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing business operations; expectations of the effect on our financial
condition of claims, litigation, environmental costs, contingent liabilities and governmental and regulatory
investigations and proceedings; and our strategy for growth and product development.

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are
based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future
plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual
results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to successfully
integrate acquired businesses; any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to
our information technology; the impact of significant fluctuations and volatility in various input costs, such as
cotton and oil-related materials, utilities, freight and wages; our ability to manage our inventory effectively and
accurately forecast demand for our products; the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which
we compete; the risk of improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners that threatens our
reputation and ability to do business; our complex multinational tax structure; significant fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates; our ability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or to
maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed; risks associated with our indebtedness; and
the other factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” of this offering memorandum.

Any forward-looking statement in this offering memorandum speaks only as of the date of this offering
memorandum. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or
oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise.

statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
We do not separately present the financial information of the Issuer because the Issuer is a newly-formed
company that has been formed solely for the purposes of issuing the notes. As of the date the notes are issued, the
Issuer will not conduct any operating activities, hold any material assets, other than the proceeds of this offering,
or have any material liabilities, other than the notes, and the Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than
those related to its formation in preparation for the issuance of the notes.

**Change in Presentation of Certain Segment-Level Financial Information**

As a result of a shift in management responsibilities, we decided during the first quarter of 2016 to change the
reporting of certain segment-level financial information previously included in our public filings made with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including (1) by moving our wholesale e-commerce
business from our Direct to Consumer segment into our Innerwear and Activewear segments and (2) changing
how we allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses between segments. The financial results
relating to segment information for the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016 and the fiscal quarter ended April 4,
2015 contained in this offering memorandum discussed under “Summary,” “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business,” and in our consolidated financial
statements included in this offering memorandum, reflect these changes to the reporting of our segment-level
financial information. However, the financial results relating to segment information for the fiscal years ended
January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 contained in this offering memorandum and in our
consolidated financial statements do not reflect these changes to the reporting of our segment-level financial
information.

**Presentation of Condensed Financial Information Concerning the Guarantors**

The information in this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, and this offering memorandum does not contain financial statement footnote disclosure about the
guarantors compared to our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which would be required as part of a registered offering.
The financial information contained in Note 22, “Consolidating Financial Information” in the notes to our
audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28,
2013 and Note 13, “Consolidating Financial Information” in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, each of which is included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum, provide financial information regarding the guarantors of the 6.375% Senior Notes
due 2020 issued by the parent guarantor, which have been called for redemption and discharged. Our subsidiaries
guaranteeing the 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 are not the same as the guarantors, and you should not rely on
the information in these footnotes as indicative of the financial condition or results of operations of the
guarantors.

**Our Company**

We are a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the
world’s strongest apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali, JMS/Just My
_Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Flexees, Lilyette and Gear for Sports._

We sell bras, panties, shapewear, hosiery, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, socks, T-shirts and other
activewear in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate
apparel, male underwear and children’s underwear than any other company. Unlike most apparel companies, we
primarily operate our own manufacturing facilities. More than 80% of the apparel units that we sell in the United
States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

We have a long history of innovation, product excellence and brand recognition. In fact, more than 80% of U.S.
households have our products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports
bra and we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex). We are now using our Innovate-toElevate strategy to integrate our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain
to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex
Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform and temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform incorporate bigidea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and
geographies.

Founded in 1901, we were organized as a Maryland corporation in 2005 and spun off from Sara Lee Corporation
in 2006, at which time we became an independent, publicly-traded corporation. Since then, we have used
strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio. In November 2010, we expanded our activewear portfolio
through the acquisition of GearCo, Inc., known as Gear for Sports, a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in
collegiate bookstores and other channels. In October 2013, we acquired Maidenform Brands Inc., a global
intimate apparel company, including the brands Maidenform, Flexees and Lilyette. We acquired another portfolio
of strong brands including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Shock Absorber and Abanderado through the August
2014 acquisition of DBA Lux Holding S.A. (“Hanes Europe Innerwear”), a leading marketer of intimate apparel,
hosiery and underwear in Europe. In April 2015, we acquired Knights Holdco, Inc., a leading seller of licensed
collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel. As described below under “—Recent
Developments,” in April 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire Champion Europe S.p.A. (“Champion
Europe”), which owns the trademark for the Champion brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as
Pacific Brands Limited (“Pacific Brands”), the leading underwear and intimate apparel company in Australia. We
believe these acquisitions will create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased scale to serve retailers.

We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good
corporate responsibility program for community and environmental improvement. We are the only apparel
producer to ever be honored by the Great Place to Work Institute for its workplace practices in Central America
and the Caribbean, and in 2015 were ranked No. 160 on the Forbes magazine list of America’s Best Employers.
For seven consecutive years, Hanesbrands has won the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star
sustained excellence/partner of the year award—the only apparel company to earn sustained excellence honors.
In 2015, we ranked No. 246 on Newsweek magazine’s green list of 500 largest U.S. companies.

**Our Brands and Operations**

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across a
broad range of basic apparel products. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by
units sold in most product categories in which we compete. Each of our brands has a unique consumer positioning that
distinguishes it from its competitors and guides its advertising and product development.

_Hanes is the largest and most widely recognized brand in our portfolio. Hanes is the number one brand of total_
apparel in the United States and is found in eight out of ten U.S. households. The Hanes brand covers all of our
product categories, including men’s, women’s and children’s underwear, bras, socks, T-shirts, fleece, shapewear
and sheer hosiery. Hanes stands for outstanding comfort, style and value.

_Champion is our second-largest brand. For nearly 100 years, Champion has been outfitting athletes in authentic,_
high-quality athletic apparel, including high-performance sports bras, team uniforms and gym essentials like
classic T-shirts, mesh shorts and fleece hoodies. An industry leader in quality, design and performance
innovation, Champion provides athletes with mobility, durability and up-to-date styles—in and out of the gym,
on and off the field. Champion has also collaborated on premium apparel items through an exclusive collection
with Todd Snyder, a limited edition men’s apparel line for Urban Outfitters and custom specialty items for
Supreme. In addition, we distribute a full line of men’s, women’s and children’s C9 by Champion products
exclusively through Target Corporation (“Target”) stores. As described below under “—Recent Developments,”
we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Champion Europe, which owns the trademark for the Champion
brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Our brand portfolio also includes a number of iconic intimate apparel brands: Bali offers a range of bras, panties
and shapewear sold in the department store channel and is the number one bra brand in department stores.
_Playtex is the United States’ number one plus-size bra brand. Playtex offers superior fit and support for women_
of all sizes and is sold everywhere from mass merchandise retailers to department stores. DIM is a flagship
European brand and a market leader in women’s underwear, hosiery and intimate apparel in France. Maidenform
is the number one shapewear brand in the United States and has been trusted for modern, sensual style in bras,
panties and shapewear since 1922. As described below under “—Recent Developments,” we recently entered
into an agreement to acquire Pacific Brands, which owns the Bonds brand, an iconic century-old brand that holds
the No. 1 market share in Australia for men’s underwear, women’s underwear, children’s underwear, babywear
and socks, as well as the No. 3 position in Australia in bras.

In addition, we offer a variety of products under the following well-known brands: JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/
_Nur Der, L’eggs, Wonderbra, Gear for Sports, Lilyette and Loveable._

These brands serve to round out our product offerings, allowing us to give consumers a variety of options to meet
their diverse needs.

with consumers. Over the past decade we have spent over $1 billion on innovation, research and development,
quality improvements and advertising to further strengthen our brands as well as our relationship with
consumers. That strong consumer relationship, coupled with the replenishment nature of our categories, is an
important driver of our revenue stream.

_High-volume, core basic apparel products. We sell high-volume, frequently replenished core basic apparel_
products. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or
design details, and are frequently replenished by consumers. We believe that our status as a high-volume seller of
core basic apparel products creates a more predictable revenue base and reduces our exposure to fashion shifts
often observed in the general apparel industry.

_Significant scale of operations. Hanesbrands is the largest basic apparel company in the world, selling innerwear_
and activewear in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. Most of our products are sold to large retailers that
have high-volume demands. We believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide
us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design, marketing and customer
management resources than our smaller competitors.

_Global supply chain. We believe that our supply chain provides us with a distinct competitive advantage and sets_
us apart from the vast majority of apparel companies. We have over 53,000 Hanesbrands employees in 47 largescale, highly efficient facilities, grouped into three main clusters: Central America, the Caribbean Basin and
Asia. We also manufacture hosiery and certain other products in various company-owned facilities in both the
United States and Europe. Our supply chain is balanced between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. This
balanced approach not only helps mitigate logistic and geo-political risks, but it also allows us to serve
approximately 70% of the world’s gross domestic product in a low-cost manner. By owning our supply chain, we
have accumulated deep product and manufacturing knowledge, developed proven manufacturing processes and
created a culture of continuous improvement. This provides us with a number of benefits that we believe have
driven higher, sustainable profit margins.

_Strong customer relationships. We sell our products primarily through large, high-volume retailers, including_
mass merchants, department stores and national chains. We have strong, long-term relationships with our top
customers—in fact, all of our key customer relationships have been in place for ten years or more. We have
aligned significant parts of our organization with corresponding parts of our customers’ organizations. We also
have entered into customer-specific programs such as our C9 by Champion products marketed and sold through
Target.

_International presence. We have a strong international presence, which we expect to continue to grow with the_
pending acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Our innerwear brands are market leaders across
Western and Central Europe. In the intimate apparel category, we hold the number one market share in France
and Spain and the number two market share in Italy. We are also the category leader in men’s underwear in
France and Spain, and in hosiery in France and Germany.

**Key Business Strategies**

A key driver of our success over the last number of years has been our singular focus on executing our strategies.
These strategies can be best summarized by our mantra of “Sell More,” “Spend Less” and “Make Acquisitions.”
“Sell More” is continuing to deliver great innovation to consumers and quickly growing ecommerce. “Spend
Less” is continuing to leverage our company-owned, low-cost supply chain as well as our infrastructure. “Make
Acquisitions” is applying both our “Sell More” and “Spend Less” strategies to newly-acquired companies to
generate substantial multi-year synergies.


4


-----

_Innovate-to-elevate. A key driver of “Sell More” is our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which for a number of years_
has been a significant contributor to both our revenue growth and margin expansion. Innovate-to-Elevate
integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost supply chain to provide higher valued
products while lowering production costs.

- _Brand power. The first element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our brand power. We seek to drive_
modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed
value. Our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry. Our brands hold either the number
one or number two market position in the United States by units sold in most product categories in which we
compete. Internationally, our commercial markets include Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and
Australia, where we believe a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the United
States will be concentrated over the next decade. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and
industry trends is key to our success. Our design, research and product development teams, in partnership
with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights
into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to
modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer
needs and industry trends. We also support our key brands with targeted, effective advertising and
marketing campaigns.

- _Platform innovation. The second element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is platform innovation. We_
focus on identifying the long-term megatrends that will impact our categories over the next five to ten years.
Once we have identified these trends, we utilize a disciplined big-idea process to put more science into the
art of apparel. Our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms. For example, our Tagless apparel
platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform and ComfortBlend and X-Temp fabric platforms incorporate bigidea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and
geographies. We are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply
chain in order to drive further economies of scale.

- _Low-cost global supply chain. The third element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our low-cost global_
supply chain. We seek to expand margins through optimizing our low-cost global supply chain and
streamlining our operations to reduce costs. We believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of
operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design,
marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors. Our global supply chain spans
across both the Western and Eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product
supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across
different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers
customers a reliable source of supply. Our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our
production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres, thereby diversifying our production
risks. Our global supply chain has generated significant cost savings, margin expansion and contributions to
cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size, scale and production capability.

_Online sales. The second strategy that we use to “Sell More” is driving online sales, an important channel in_
apparel. We have a three-pronged approach to growing our sales online: (1) we work directly with internet pureplays in a wholesale relationship, (2) we support the online efforts of our traditional retail partners and (3) we
operate our own websites. We currently hold leading market shares in our key categories in the online channel.
We expect online growth to accelerate, therefore, we are aggressively re-allocating people and marketing
investments to capture this growth and to expand our market share.

_Supply chain and SG&A efficiencies. We “Spend Less” by implementing two strategies: leveraging our_
company-owned, low-cost global supply chain and continually leveraging our SG&A. By owning our supply
chain, we have accumulated deep product and manufacturing knowledge, developed proven manufacturing
processes and created a culture of continuous improvement. This provides us with a number of benefits that we


5


-----

believe have driven higher, sustainable profit margins. For example, through our various continuous
improvement programs we have generated, on average, $35 to $40 million per year in efficiency gains—and
when we internalize production, we are able to lower our product costs by approximately 15% to 20%. In
addition, by improving administrative processes with technology and Lean methodologies, as well as maintaining
tight cost controls, we are able to leverage our SG&A and deliver significant improvement in our productivity
without a corresponding increase in personnel.

_Acquisitions. “Make Acquisitions” is an important component of our business model because it allows us to_
generate significant shareholder returns by creating value from the multi-year synergies we create through
grafting our “Sell More” and “Spend Less” strategies onto the newly-acquired companies. We are focused on
acquisitions that meet our strict criteria for strong likely returns with relatively low risk. Specifically, we seek
acquisition candidates that are: (1) in our core categories; (2) provide complimentary growth opportunities in
consumer segments, channels or geographies; (3) have high-probability cost synergies that leverage our supply
chain and/or SG&A structure and (4) are accretive in year one, excluding integration costs.

**Recent Developments**

**_Acquisitions_**

On April 7, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Champion Europe, which owns the
trademark for the Champion brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We have agreed to acquire the
privately held Champion Europe, based in Italy, in an all-cash transaction. The purchase price will be ten times
actual calendar 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to adjustment for
cash, debt and working capital. We believe the final purchase price will be between €190 million and €210
million. The acquisition, which is subject to certain closing conditions, is expected to close in mid-2016.

On April 27, 2016, we entered into a scheme implementation deed to acquire Pacific Brands in an all-cash
transaction. We will acquire Pacific Brands through a recommended court approved scheme of arrangement at a
purchase price of approximately $800 million, which equals AUD$1.15 per share of Pacific Brands stock, less
any special dividends paid by Pacific Brands prior to the closing. The acquisition, which is subject to certain
closing conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016.

Pacific Brands is the leading underwear and intimate apparel company in Australia, with total sales over
AUD$800 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2015. Pacific Brands currently has three
business units—Underwear, Sheridan and Tontine & Dunlop. The company has undergone significant
restructuring over the past two years to streamline its portfolio to focus on the core Underwear and Sheridan
businesses. We intend to divest the Tontine pillow business and Dunlop flooring business following the
acquisition because we do not consider these units to be part of Pacific Brands’ core business.

Of the core business, Underwear accounts for approximately three-fourths of Pacific Brands’ sales and includes
underwear, bras, socks, hosiery, babywear and outerwear. The Underwear group operates more than 150
company retail stores and retailer shop-in-shops. Pacific Brands’ biggest Underwear brand is the fast-growing
_Bonds, an iconic century-old brand that holds the No. 1 market share in Australia for men’s underwear, women’s_
underwear, children’s underwear, babywear and socks, as well as the No. 3 position in bras in Australia. In
addition, the Berlei brand of premium bras sold in department stores is No. 2 in overall bra market share in
Australia and No. 1 in sports bras in Australia.

We intend to finance the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions using a combination of the net
proceeds of this offering, cash on hand and future debt financings.

**_Refinancing Transactions_**

On May 6, 2016, we completed the sale of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of
$900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2024 and $900 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem in full our
outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, which have been called
for redemption on June 2, 2016 in accordance with their terms, and to repay $706.5 million of our outstanding
borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of our payment of the redemption price associated
with our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, we have discharged all of our obligations under the indenture governing
our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020. We refer to these transactions, including the payment of all related fees and
expenses, collectively, as the “Refinancing Transactions.”

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a corporate partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par actions) incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg on May 13, 2016. The Issuer was formed by MFB International Holdings S.à r.l. (“MFB
International Holdings”) for the purposes of issuing the notes offered hereby. The Issuer has no material assets or
liabilities, and it has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation in preparation for
offering of the notes. The Issuer’s registered office is at 33, Rue du Puits Romain, L—8070 Bertrange, Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and is currently in the process of being registered with the Luxembourg Trade and
Companies’ Register.

The general partner of the Issuer is Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg S.à.r.l. (“Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg”), a

Proceeds Loan, to make payments on the Proceeds Loan. MFB International Holdings will not be obliged to
make any other payments or capital contribution to the Issuer other than those required under the Proceeds
Loan. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Issuer’s ability to pay principal and interest
may be affected by our organizational structure because the Issuer is dependent upon payments from us and
our other subsidiaries to fund payments to you on the notes.” In connection with this offering, the Issuer and
its general partner, Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg, will become guarantors under our Euro Term Loan
Facility and their shares and assets, including the Issuer’s receivable under the Proceeds Loan, will be
pledged to secure our obligations under the Euro Term Loan Facility.
(4) The notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to
any of the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes and
will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so
subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The notes will be
effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness.
(5) Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are primarily comprised of subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing operations
to produce finished products for delivery to, and sale by, our guarantor subsidiaries as well as certain
subsidiaries that sell products through our International segment. For the 12 months ended April 2, 2016, we
estimate that these non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for less than 15% of our sales, excluding
intercompany transactions. As of April 2, 2016, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented less than 40% of
our total assets and had less than $900 million of total liabilities, including trade payables but excluding
intercompany liabilities.
(6) The Issuer’s obligations under the notes will initially be guaranteed by the parent guarantor and by each
existing and future domestic and international direct and indirect subsidiary of the parent guarantor that also
guarantees indebtedness under our Euro Term Loan Facility (other than Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L.
Unipersonal (“Maidenform Brands Spain”) and the subsidiaries of the parent guarantor incorporated in
Honduras and El Salvador) and, in the future, by each of the parent guarantor’s subsidiaries that guarantee
certain material debt facilities of the Issuer or the guarantors or certain material debt securities issued by the
Issuer or the guarantors. The U.S. domiciled guarantors also guarantee on a senior basis the obligations of
the parent guarantor under the senior notes issued on May 6, 2016 as part of the Refinancing Transactions
(see “Summary—Refinancing Transactions”) and our Senior Secured Credit Facility (including our Euro
Term Loan Facility). The validity and enforceability of certain of the guarantees and the liability of certain
of the guarantors will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and
Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.”
(7) On the issue date, Maidenform Brands Spain, HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l. (“HBI Italy Acquisition Co.”)
and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd (“Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co.”) will not be
guarantors of the notes. Maidenform Brands Spain is currently a guarantor under our Euro Term Loan
Facility, and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition Co. and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. will become
guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility on or prior to the date of the consummation of our
acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, respectively. We have agreed that these entities will
guarantee the notes no later than 30 days after the consummation of this offering. See “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors.”
(8) As of April 2, 2016, we had approximately $9.6 million of debt outstanding stemming from debt we
assumed in connection with the Hanes Europe Innerwear acquisition, $6.6 million of which was an
obligation of one or more of our subsidiary guarantors. This outstanding long-term debt consists of
mortgage loans and term loans collateralized by fixed assets.

denominations of less than €100,000 are not available.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date of
the notes), the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium.

In addition, on or after, 2024 (three months prior to the
maturity date of the notes) the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of
the notes a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

**Additional Amounts; Tax** All payments in respect of the notes will be made without
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental
charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as
defined under “Description of Notes”), subject to certain exceptions,
the Issuer or the relevant guarantor, as applicable, will pay additional
amounts so that the net amount received is no less than the amount
that would have been received in the absence of such withholding or
deduction.

The Issuer may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,
upon giving prior notice, if certain changes in tax law impose certain
withholding taxes on amounts payable on or with respect to the notes
and, as a result, the Issuer or a guarantor is required to pay additional
amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the Issuer decides
to exercise such redemption right, it must pay you a price equal to the

principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, in respect of such redeemed notes, to the
redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for
Taxation Reasons.”

**Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of Change of Control Triggering Event (as
defined under “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering
Event”), you will have the right, as holders of the notes, to cause the
Issuer to repurchase your notes at 101% of their face amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase
date. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering
Event.”

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by
the parent guarantor, Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg and by each of its
subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under our Euro Term
Loan Facility (excluding Maidenform Brands Spain and the
subsidiaries of the parent guarantor incorporated in Honduras and El
Salvador) and, in the future, by each of the parent guarantor’s
subsidiaries that guarantee certain material debt facilities of the Issuer
or the guarantors or certain material debt securities issued by the
Issuer or the guarantors. Under certain circumstances, guarantors may
be released from their guarantees without the consent of the holders
of notes. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

On the issue date, Maidenform Brands Spain, HBI Italy Acquisition
Co. and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. will not be guarantors
of the notes. Maidenform Brands Spain is currently a guarantor under
our Euro Term Loan Facility, and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition
Co. and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. will become
guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility on or prior to the date
of the consummation of our acquisitions of Champion Europe and
Pacific Brands, respectively. We have agreed that these entities will
guarantee the notes no later than 30 days after the consummation of
this offering. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Future
Guarantors.”

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are primarily comprised of
subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing operations to produce finished
products for delivery to, and sale by, our guarantor subsidiaries as
well as certain subsidiaries that sell products through our International
segment. For the 12 months ended April 2, 2016, we estimate that
these non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for less than 15% of our
sales, excluding intercompany transactions. As of April 2, 2016, our
non-guarantor subsidiaries:

                      - represented less than 40% of our total assets; and

                       - had less than $900 million of total liabilities, including trade
payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.

The validity and enforceability of certain of the guarantees and the
liability of certain of the guarantors will be subject to the limitations
described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on
the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

**Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and the guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations of
the Issuer and the guarantors and will:

                       - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility;

                       - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness;

                       - be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all the Issuer’s
and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness
(including all of our borrowings and the guarantors’ guarantees
under our Senior Secured Credit Facility); and

                       - be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and
future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables)
of each of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

As of April 2, 2016, after giving effect this offering and the
application of the estimated net proceeds from this offering as set
forth in “Use of Proceeds,” and the Refinancing Transactions:

                      - we would have had $3.85 billion of total consolidated indebtedness
(including the notes);

                     - we would have had commitments available to be borrowed under our
Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $888.6 million (which
commitments may be borrowed to, among other things, finance the
acquisitions of Champion Europe and/or Pacific Brands); and

                      - an aggregate of approximately $3.65 billion of total indebtedness
would have been guaranteed by one or more of the guarantors.

**Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the notes under an indenture among the Issuer,
the guarantors and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee. The
indenture will, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and
the guarantors to:

                       - incur certain liens;

                       - enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and

                        - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants will be subject to a number of important exceptions
and qualifications. For more details, see “Description of Notes.”

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We have not registered the notes under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale. For more information, see
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with
cash on hand and future debt financings to finance the Champion
Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We expect to submit an application to list the notes on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the notes to
trading on the Euro MTF Market. There are no assurances that the
notes will be admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market.

The Issuer may choose to apply to list the notes on another
recognized stock exchange or may, at any time, upon the good faith
determination of the parent guarantor’s senior management that the
ongoing reporting requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
are overly burdensome (including, for the avoidance of doubt, more
burdensome than the parent guarantor’s reporting requirements under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”)) to the Issuer, determine that it will not maintain such listing
and may instead seek to obtain a listing of such notes on another
recognized stock exchange. Nothing in this offering memorandum
shall obligate the Issuer to list the notes, and there can be no
assurance that an application to list the notes will be approved.
Settlement of the notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Absence of a Public Market for the** The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** established trading market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for
a listing of the notes on any securities exchange or an automated
dealer quotation system, except that we expect to apply for a listing of
the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
for admission to trading of the notes on the Euro MTF Market. There
are no assurances that the notes will be listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or that they will be admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market. See “Listing and General
Information.” Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not
develop. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently
intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated
to do so, and any market making with respect to the notes may be
discontinued without notice.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indenture, the notes and the guarantees will be governed by the
laws of the State of New York.

**Risk Factors**

_An investment in the notes involves risk. In addition to the risks described below, you should also carefully read_
_all of the other information included in this offering memorandum in evaluating an investment in the notes. If any_
_of the described risks actually were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be_
_affected materially and adversely. In that case, our ability to fulfill our obligations under the notes could be_
_materially affected and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us_
_or that we currently deem immaterial individually or in the aggregate may also impair our business operations._

_The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ_
_substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding_
_Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**Our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses could impact our financial results.**

As a leading branded apparel company, we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions as part of our longterm business strategy, such as our recent acquisition of Knights Apparel or our recently announced acquisitions
of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations
of businesses that we acquire and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that
we expect will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain
operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside
services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the conversion of core operating systems, data
systems and products and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the
conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products may result in the loss of customers, operational
problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such acquisitions.
Annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the closing of the
acquisition is delayed unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the
conversion to a single set of data systems is not accomplished on a timely basis.

Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations, including expected levels of revenues, and
may require unanticipated costs and expenditures. In addition, following completion of an acquisition, we may
not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business
have achieved or might achieve separately. Acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were
unable to discover in the course of our due diligence, and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such
other businesses, even if obtained, may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities. In addition, the
integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and time-consuming and may not be entirely
successful. Integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal
control over financial reporting. The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses could cause an
interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the
possible loss of key personnel. If we are unable to successfully integrate any newly acquired business or if the
acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

**Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our information**
**technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.**

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology
systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and support global growth and expansion, problems
with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty
in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a breach in security of these systems could
adversely impact the operations of our business.

-----

Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.
Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers’
or employees’ personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media
attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits.

Moreover, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory and industry standards enacted to
protect business and personal data. Any failure to comply with these regulatory and industry standards could
subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in
violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage
to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.

**Significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs, such as cotton and oil-related**
**materials, utilities, freight and wages, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of**
**operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our
ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing
process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other
costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a
significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar
may result in higher manufacturing costs. Sudden decreases in the costs for materials, including cotton, may
result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production, which could result in lower profitability,
particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure. If, in the future we incur volatility in the costs
for materials, including cotton, and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved
efficiencies, or if our competitors’ unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure,
our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.

**Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively**
**and accurately forecast demand for our products.**

We are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs.
Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to
anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences
and trends into marketable product offerings, as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or
other factors, which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
retailers.

Inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain, a long manufacturing process and the
seasonal nature of certain products. We sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers, and
these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods. As a result, we often schedule
internal production and place orders for products with third-party manufacturers before our customers’ orders are
firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage
of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory
write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the
image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate
demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce
products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost
revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect
on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, sudden decreases in the costs for materials, including cotton, may result in the cost of inventory
exceeding the cost of new production; if this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition or cash flow, particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory.

19


-----

Excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered plant and equipment
utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

**We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and our market share and results of**
**operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future.**

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based upon brand,
comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign
corporations and manufacturers, as well as department stores and other retailers, including many of our
customers, that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands.
Also, online retail shopping is rapidly evolving, and we expect competition in the e-commerce market to
intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. Increased
competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices, in
each case decreasing our cash flows, operating margins and profitability. Our ability to identify and capitalize on
retail trends, including technology, e-commerce and other process efficiencies to gain market share and better
service our customer base will, in large part, determine our future success. If we fail to compete successfully, our
market share, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

**Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by**
**any of our employees, agents or business partners.**

Our business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local
wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. False Claims Act, the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations),
unclaimed property laws and many others. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect
us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any violations of law or improper
conduct could damage our reputation and, depending on the circumstances, subject us to, among other things,
civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on
future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could have a
material adverse impact on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the
market value of our stock.

**We have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes**
**resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and**
**adversely affect our results.**

We have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our
allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing
agreements is subject to review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities. Our
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where
we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations,
accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In order to service our debt obligations, we may need to increase
the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the United States, which may
significantly increase our income tax expense. In addition, we are also subject to the continuous examination of
our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the IRS and other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy
of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally,
changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related
regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we
record, as well as our capital deployment strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

20

**Due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates**
**could negatively impact our results of operations.**

A growing percentage of our total revenues (approximately 20% in 2015) is derived from markets outside the
United States. We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we
purchase many of our raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in
foreign currencies. As a result, when the U.S. dollar weakens against any of these currencies, our cost of sales
could increase substantially. Outside the United States, we may pay for materials or finished products in U.S.
dollars, and in some cases a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use
foreign currency to purchase the U.S. dollars we need to make such payments. Changes on foreign currency
exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange
rates. However, no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk. We are also exposed
to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the
reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our
foreign subsidiaries.

**Inability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain**
**sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.**

We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit
Facility and other external debt financings to meet the cash requirements of our business. We have significant
capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently
fund the cash flow needs of our business and pursue strategic acquisitions.

Although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain
that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt at a reasonable
cost when necessary. The ability to have continued access to reasonably priced credit is dependent upon our
current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and general economic conditions. If
we are unable to access the capital markets at a reasonable economic cost, it could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition.

**Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem**
**could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal**
**liability.**

We have a complex global supply chain and distribution network that supports our ability consistently to provide
our products to our customers. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity
problem, such as an earthquake, tsunami, terrorist or hacker attack, pandemic or other natural or man-made
disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office
facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations.
While our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our redundant back-up and
disaster recovery systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or
other business continuity event, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon
how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular
aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group. If we cannot
respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key
manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply
systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could
result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. All of the foregoing can
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**Our operations in international markets, and our earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal,**
**regulatory, political and economic risks.**

During 2015, net sales from our International segment were $1.1 billion, representing approximately 20% of total
net sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or our
products are sourced from, outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations,
unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, and political unrest and corruption.

Regulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly
increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed
by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when, after we have moved our operations to a
particular location, new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in
effect are changed.

Countries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new
regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:

    - changes in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;

    - limitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from a particular
country;

    - requirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;

    - creation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or
specification of minimum export pricing and/or export prices or duties;

    - limitations on foreign owned businesses; or

    - government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on
obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity,
political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could
interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or
decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the
foreign countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we
outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation
could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating
results.

**Economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause**
**our customers, suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, all of which could**
**adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a
planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers.
Discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control, including, among others,
general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit,
currency exchange rates, taxation, energy prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer

confidence and spending. Reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels,
reduced orders to us or order cancellations. These lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions
on access to the credit markets, may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store
closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our
customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. Any of these occurrences could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading
to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and
finished goods, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our
credit facilities and derivatives transactions. In addition, the inability of these third parties to overcome these
difficulties may increase. If third parties on which we rely for raw materials, finished goods or services are
unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need, or if
counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

**We may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions.**

Our business may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably
warm weather in the fall or winter, or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer, can
negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. In addition, severe weather events such as snow storms or
hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic. Any of these conditions could result in negative
point-of-sale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customers.

**Our failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve the desired results may negatively**
**impact our business.**

The implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects, which
places significant demands on our management, accounting, financial, information and other systems and on our
business. Our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on management’s ability to timely and
effectively anticipate and adapt to our changing business needs. We cannot assure you that our management will
be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully. If we miscalculate the resources or
time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively, our business and operating results
could be adversely affected.

**We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of or**
**material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our**
**business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

In 2015, our top ten customers accounted for 56% of our net sales and our top two customers, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) and Target, accounted for 23% and 15% of our net sales, respectively. We expect that these
customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future. Moreover, our top
customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines.
We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products, and as
a result, most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis. A decision by any of our top customers to
significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In
addition, if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products, our sales to those customers could
be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business. Any such reduction in apparel selling space
could result in lower sales and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be
adversely affected.

23


-----

**The loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and**
**materially harm our business.**

We purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 35% of the cost of sales derived
from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to
meet our customers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and
finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers. Our business, financial condition or results of
operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience
financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions,
production problems, difficulties in sourcing raw materials, lack of capacity or transportation disruptions, or if
for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them.
The magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions, the materials or products that the third
party manufacturers provide and the volume of production.

Our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure
and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products. Quality failures by our third party manufacturers or
changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply
quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our business.

**Our business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel.**

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel,
some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace. The loss or interruption of
the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse
effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the
responsibilities of the position. Our future success will also depend on our ability to develop and/or recruit
employees with the core competencies needed to support our growth in global markets and in new products or
services. We may not be able to attract or retain these employees, which could adversely affect our business.

**If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our**
**sales could be negatively affected.**

Inadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased
sales. Additionally, if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising,
media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of
our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial
condition.

**If we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results**
**accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business**
**or the market price of our securities.**

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial
reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our
financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, our brands and operating results could be harmed.
Pursuant to the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal
control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations,
including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even
effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of

24


-----

changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail
to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved
controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be
harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business or the market price of our securities.

**We may suffer negative publicity if we or our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in**
**practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal, which could cause a loss of business.**

We cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third party manufacturers, the majority of whom
are located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. If one of our own manufacturing operations or one
of our third party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other
applicable regulations, or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our
products are sold as unethical, we could suffer negative publicity, which could tarnish our brands’ image or result
in a loss of sales. In addition, if such negative publicity affected one of our customers, it could result in a loss of
business for us.

**Our existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis, forms of economic support and other**
**changes that could be harmful to our business.**

Customers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis, which
could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units, we must carry and, consequently, increase our
inventory levels and working capital requirements. Moreover, our customers may increasingly seek markdown
allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support, which reduce our gross margins and affect our
profitability. Our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to
reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs.

**The success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands, including brands that we**
**license to other parties. If other parties take actions that weaken, harm the reputation of or cause**
**confusion with our brands, our business, and consequently our sales, results of operations and cash flows,**
**may be adversely affected.**

We license some of our important trademarks to third parties. For example, we license Champion to third parties
for athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality
control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a risk that some licensees may
not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations. In such event, or if a licensee engages in
behavior with respect to the licensed marks that may cause us reputational harm or otherwise tarnish or dilute the
brands, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and
results of operations.

**We design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties.**
**If any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company**
**reputational harm, our business may be adversely affected.**

We design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third
parties, such as our Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear and our Donna Karan and DKNY intimate apparel.
Because we do not control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make changes to their brands or business
models that could result in significant expenditures on our part or a significant downturn in a brand’s business,
adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. If any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the
licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the
trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a significant
downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations, and we may be
required to expend significant amounts on public relations, advertising and, possibly, legal fees.

25

**If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.**

Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these
trademarks from infringement, tarnishing and dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and
administrative proceedings. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual
property rights. Infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or
otherwise adversely affect our business. Actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property
rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property
rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the United States or other countries, such as changes to or the
repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to
enforce those rights.

The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks
and other intellectual property rights. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our
satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the
laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of
the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. We are from
time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual
property.

**Market returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension, which may**
**require significant funding.**

The plan assets of our pension plans, which had a loss of approximately 3% during 2015 and a return of
approximately 4% during 2014, are invested mainly in domestic and international equities, bonds and real estate.
We are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the
financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. The funded status of
these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are
subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Under the U.S.
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “Pension Protection Act”), losses of asset values may necessitate increased
funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. Under the Pension
Protection Act funding rules, our U.S. qualified pension plan is approximately 104% funded as of January 2,
2016. Any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than
we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations.

**Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the**
**estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge,**
**which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.**

Goodwill, trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. The
fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be
lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets
or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the
impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately $834 million of goodwill and $701 million of trademarks and other
identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet, which together represented 27% of our total assets. No impairment
was identified in 2015. Changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

26


-----

**Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets. We must generate sufficient future**
**taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefits.**

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately $374 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, which
represents 7% of our total assets. Deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences (differences between the
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of
taxable income). The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized. If we are unable to
generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the actual
effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or
deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which
would cause an increase in our effective tax rate. A significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

**We had approximately 65,300 employees worldwide as of January 2, 2016, and our business operations**
**and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees**
**or changes to U.S. or foreign employment regulations.**

We had approximately 65,300 employees worldwide as of January 2, 2016. This means we have a significant
exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees, including
wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay,
unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which likely
would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Approximately 57,600 of those employees were outside of the
United States. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees
could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take
other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources
responding to such increases and lower our margins.

In addition, approximately 30 of our employees in the United States and a significant number of our international
employees are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If there were
a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties
to collective bargaining agreements, we would become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action
by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our business.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of**
**operations, as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt.**

As of April 2, 2016, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the estimated net proceeds from this
offering as set forth in “Use of Proceeds,” and the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had $3.85 billion of
outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including the notes, and other ongoing
business obligations, which may result in defaults;

    - subjecting us to events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained
in the agreements governing our debt instruments, which could result in all of our debt becoming
immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants
that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses;

    - subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases in our outstanding
indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates and could cause our debt service obligations to
increase significantly;

27


-----

    - reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these
purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in
our business, the industries in which we operate and the overall economy;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that have less debt or are
less leveraged; and

    - increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.

Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt.

**Despite our current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could**
**exacerbate further the risks associated with our leverage.**

Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to
generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot
assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available
to us under our existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet
our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs.

We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, for many
reasons, including to fund the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions, as well as other acquisitions we
may pursue in the future. The terms of the indenture that will govern the notes generally will not restrict us from
doing so. As of April 2, 2016, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had
approximately $888.6 million of commitments available to be borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility
(which commitments may be borrowed to, among other things, finance the acquisitions of Champion Europe and/
or Pacific Brands). In addition, the indenture that will govern the notes will allow us to issue additional notes
under certain circumstances, which will also be guaranteed by some or all of the guarantors. Although the
indenture that will govern the notes will place some limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries,
to create liens securing indebtedness, there will be significant exceptions to these limitations that will allow us
and our subsidiaries to secure significant amounts of indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the notes,
including through our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we or our subsidiaries incur secured
indebtedness and such secured indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization, our and our subsidiaries’ assets would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the
indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on the notes that are not similarly secured.
Subject to certain limitations, the indenture that will govern the notes also will not restrict our non-guarantor
subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the notes. In addition, the
indenture that will govern the notes will not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring other liabilities that do
not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks
that we now face could intensify.

**The Issuer’s ability to pay principal and interest may be affected by our organizational structure because**
**the Issuer is dependent upon payments from us and our other subsidiaries to fund payments to you on the**
**notes.**

The Issuer does not conduct any business operations and does not have any assets or sources of income, other
than the Proceeds Loan and capital contributions. As a result, the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the notes
is dependent directly upon interest or other payments it receives from us and our other subsidiaries.

28


-----

The parent guarantor and the subsidiary guarantors will guarantee the notes. A portion of the parent guarantor’s
operations and assets are conducted and owned by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness
and our ability to make payments on the notes will be dependent on the generation of cash flow by our
subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer, by capital contribution, debt repayment or
otherwise. Unless they guarantee the notes, any of our existing or future subsidiaries will not have any obligation
to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to,
or may not be permitted to, make distributions or otherwise make funds available to the Issuer to make payments
in respect of the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and
contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries or the ability of our subsidiaries
to make cash available to the Issuer. In addition, our repatriation of earnings from one or more of our non-U.S.
subsidiaries may require us to pay additional taxes which increase our effective tax rate or cause us to reassess
our tax reserves. The indenture that will govern the notes will not limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur
consensual encumbrances or restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments.
In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes. If we are unable to
obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as
refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise
additional capital. We cannot guarantee that such alternative financing would be possible or successful. Our
inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on
commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow as well as on our ability to pay interest or principal on the notes when due, or redeem
the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

**Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service**
**obligations to increase significantly.**

Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate
risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would
increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including
cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all loans are fully drawn,
each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $5.6 million change in annual interest expense on our
indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that
involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility.
However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any
swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes.**

The notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the parent guarantor, Hanesbrands GP
Luxembourg and by each of its subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under our Euro Term Loan Facility
(excluding Maidenform Brands Spain and the subsidiaries of the parent guarantor incorporated in Honduras and
El Salvador) and, in the future, by each of the parent guarantor’s subsidiaries that guarantee certain material debt
facilities of the Issuer or the guarantors or certain material debt securities issued by the Issuer or the guarantors.
Under certain circumstances, guarantors may be released from their guarantees without the consent of the holders
of notes. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes or the guarantees or to make any funds available
therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. In addition, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
may incur additional indebtedness in addition to indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In the event that any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or
otherwise winds up, holders of their debt, and their trade creditors generally, will be entitled to payment on their

29


-----

claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the Issuer or any
guarantor. Consequently, your claims in respect of the notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the
liabilities, including trade payables, of all of our subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors, even though
creditors under any other indebtedness incurred by our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not suffer subordination
to the same extent.

On the issue date, Maidenform Brands Spain, HBI Italy Acquisition Co. and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition
Co. will not be guarantors of the notes. Maidenform Brands Spain is currently a guarantor under our Euro Term
Loan Facility, and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition Co. and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. will become
guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility on or prior to the date of the consummation of our acquisitions of
Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, respectively. We have agreed that these entities will guarantee the notes
no later than 30 days after the consummation of this offering. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
Future Guarantors.”

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are primarily comprised of subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing operations to
produce finished products for delivery to, and sale by, our guarantor subsidiaries as well as certain subsidiaries
that sell products through our international segment. For the 12 months ended April 2, 2016, we estimate that
these non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for less than 15% of our sales, excluding intercompany transactions.
As of April 2, 2016, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented less than 40% of our total assets and had less
than $900 million of total liabilities, including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.
Furthermore, the guarantees by subsidiaries that do guarantee the notes may be limited in certain jurisdictions.
See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

**The notes will be effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness of the Issuer or that of the**
**guarantors to the extent of the value of the property securing that indebtedness.**

The notes will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ assets. As a result, the notes and the
guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ future secured indebtedness
with respect to the collateral that secures that indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The
effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of future secured
indebtedness, or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of the Issuer or
the guarantors, the proceeds from the sale of assets securing such secured indebtedness will be available to pay
obligations on the notes only after all indebtedness under such secured debt has been paid in full. As a result, the
holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of secured debt in the event of the Issuer’s or the
guarantors’ bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization.

**Insolvency laws and other limitations on the guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance and similar**
**laws, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes will be guaranteed by the parent guarantor and the subsidiary guarantors.
The parent guarantor is organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. The subsidiary guarantors are
organized under the laws of the States of Delaware and Colorado, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions,
in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and similar
laws and, in the case of the guarantees, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such
jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the guarantee against a guarantor. The court may also in certain
circumstances void the guarantee where a guarantor is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following
discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally
applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and
insolvency laws.

30


-----

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

    - void or invalidate or declare ineffective all or a portion of a guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee;

    - direct that holders of the notes return any amounts paid under a guarantee to the relevant guarantor or
to a fund for the benefit of the guarantor’s creditors; and

    - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the notes and any guarantee is found to be a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or an improper transfer of assets or is otherwise set aside, there can be no assurance that the Issuer
can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the notes. In addition, the liability of each guarantor under
its guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee not constituting a fraudulent
conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance
as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability. Also, there is a
possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case, the entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent or improper transfer or other applicable principles, courts
may need to make findings that, at the time the guarantees were issued, a guarantor:

    - issued such guarantee with the intent or knowledge of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or
future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its
insolvency;

    - was aware of the fact that some creditors were disadvantaged over other creditors by these actions;

    - issued such guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such guarantor
would have contributed no equity to such guarantor; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the guarantee on
the basis that the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the guarantor’s
benefit, or some other basis and (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issue of the
guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (2) was engaged, or about to engage, in
a business transaction for which the guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (3) intended to
incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due.

However, less-stringent requirements may be provided under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a guarantor generally may, in different
jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee if:

    - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

    - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

    - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that the Issuer, the parent guarantor and each of the subsidiary guarantors are solvent, and
will be so after giving effect to the offering of the notes, there can be no assurance which standard a court would
apply in determining whether a guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the guarantees were issued or that,
regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a guarantor was insolvent on that date, or
that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee
was issued, that payments to holders of the notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of the enforceability issues as they relate to the guarantees, see “Certain Insolvency
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees” with respect to some of the
jurisdictions mentioned above.

**Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the guarantees may adversely affect**
**the validity and enforceability of the guarantees.**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the guarantors are organized limit the ability of these entities to
guarantee debt of a related company. These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate
law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a
guarantee on account of a direct or indirect parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and
operationally justified from the guarantor’s perspective, as well as thin capitalization and fraudulent transfer
principles. If these limitations are not observed, the guarantees by the guarantors could be subject to legal
challenge. In accordance with the applicable laws of these jurisdictions, the guarantees will contain language
limiting the amount of debt guaranteed so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Accordingly,
if you were to enforce the guarantees by a guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be
limited. In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed is limited by reference to the net assets and legal
capital of the guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant guarantor to the Issuer under
intercompany loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or
enforcement. Further, though we believe that the guarantees will be validly given by the guarantors, in
accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a third-party creditor would not
successfully challenge the guarantees in legal proceedings.

Similarly, the laws of certain jurisdictions in which the guarantors are organized prohibit, under certain
conditions and unless available exemption procedures were carried out, so-called “financial assistance” such as
direct or indirect, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, financial
assistance for the purpose of an acquisition of that company’s shares or shares of its direct or indirect controlling
entity. The consequence of a breach of the financial assistance prohibition would be the absolute invalidity or
ineffectiveness of the respective transactions. In these jurisdictions, the guarantees will contain language
excluding certain types of obligations from the scope of such guarantees which, in turn, may limit the amount
guaranteed or secured thereunder. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees” for more information.

**Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes may prove difficult, and insolvency laws of Luxembourg, the**
**British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, France, Hong Kong, Ireland or the Netherlands may not be as**
**favorable to you as U.S. and other insolvency laws with which you may be more familiar.**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In addition, the guarantors are
incorporated under, among other jurisdictions, the laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, France,
Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to the
Issuer and the guarantors may proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of
the Issuer or a guarantor. Applicable local insolvency law may not be as favorable to your interests as the
insolvency laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar, particularly with respect
to the rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to raise post-petition interest
and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or any guarantor
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding, your rights under
the notes or the guarantees may be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance
that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceedings. In addition, any conflict between them could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws
of any particular jurisdiction should apply and there can be no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of these
jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are

32


-----

typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement
of creditors’ rights. See also “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

**Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations.**

The Issuer and a number of guarantors and their subsidiaries are organized or incorporated outside the United
States. Some of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the guarantors are non-residents of, and a
substantial portion of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the non-U.S.
guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S.
securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the guarantors who are non-US residents. In addition, as a substantial portion
of of the assets of the Issuer and the non-guarantors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments
obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer
and the non U.S. guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of
United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the non-U.S. guarantors and the directors and executive officers
who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States
federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such
persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws. The United States is not currently
bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral
awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the
enforceability in Luxembourg of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S.
judgment in Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court
based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to
certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Luxembourg court would have the requisite power or authority to
grant remedies sought in an original action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. securities laws
violations. For further information, see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”

**The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events of the parent guarantor and a ratings decline,
the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Additionally, under the Senior Secured
Credit Facility, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the commitments to lend
would terminate. The source of funds for any purchase of the notes and repayment of borrowings under the
Senior Secured Credit Facility will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or
other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase
the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because we may not have sufficient financial resources to
purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a Change of Control Triggering Event and repay our
other indebtedness that will become due. If we fail to repurchase the notes in that circumstance, we will be in
default under the indenture that will govern the notes. We may require additional financing from third parties to
fund any such purchases by the Issuer, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.
Further, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to
repurchase the notes and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreement governing the Senior
Secured Credit Facility, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be
beneficial to us.

33


-----

In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, will not, under the indenture
that will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuer to repurchase the notes,
even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our
capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control
Triggering Event.”

The exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the notes pursuant to a
change of control offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including
future agreements, even if the change of control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on
us. In the event a change of control offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from
purchasing notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions. If we do not
obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, our
failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture that will govern the
notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay
cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

**Holders of the notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to**
**have the notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law, and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and circumstances.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of
less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register**
**the notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the**
**notes.**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes. The holders of the notes will
not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the
notes in the United States only pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and therefore you may be required to bear
the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any notes,
the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the
notes that it shall not transfer the notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000. It is your
obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of notes comply with these transfer restrictions and applicable law.
See “Transfer Restrictions” for further information.

**Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market and an active**
**trading market may not develop for the notes.**

The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. We do
not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on any securities exchange or an automated dealer quotation system,
except that we expect to apply for a listing of the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and for admission to trading of the notes on the Euro MTF Market. Although an application will be made for the
notes to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we
cannot assure you that the notes will become or remain listed. The Issuer may choose to apply to list the notes on
another recognized stock exchange. In addition, upon the good faith determination of our senior management that
the ongoing reporting requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange are more burdensome than those under
the Exchange Act, we may seek to obtain a listing of the notes on another recognized stock exchange. See
“Description of Notes—Listing.”

34


-----

Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the notes as a result of the admission to trading on the
Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission
to listing on another stock exchange) of the notes, as applicable, from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have
a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

Accordingly, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the
market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at
a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes
may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

    - the number of holders of notes;

    - prevailing interest rates;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and

    - the market for similar securities.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may
experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the
prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes,
our performance and other factors.

The initial purchasers of the notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes
and, if commenced, may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice.

**A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase**
**our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.**

Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the
rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will
generally affect the market value of the notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell
the notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or
marketing of the notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain
additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn
for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.

**Holders of the notes will receive payments solely in euros subject to limited exceptions.**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the notes and any redemption price for the notes will be made in
euros, subject to certain limited exceptions. We, the initial purchasers and the trustee will not be obligated to
convert, or to assist any registered owner or beneficial owner of notes in converting, payments of interest,
principal, any redemption price or any additional amount in euros made with respect to the notes into U.S. dollars
or any other currency.

35


-----

**Holders of the notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as**
**possible exchange controls, relating to the euro.**

The initial investors in the notes will be required to pay for the notes in euros. Neither we nor the initial
purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euros or in converting other currencies into
euros to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the notes.

An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a
currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the notes resides or the currency in which
an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not
associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the
notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of:

    - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and

    - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s
home currency.

We have no control over a number of factors affecting the notes offered hereby and foreign exchange rates,
including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and
longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies
result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political
conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in
other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and
expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries,
and the extent of governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn,
sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to
international trade and finance. Moreover, the recent global economic crisis and the actions taken or to be taken
by various national governments in response to the crisis could significantly affect the exchange rates between
the euro and the investor’s home currency.

The exchange rates of an investor’s home currency for euros and the fluctuations in those exchange rates that
have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may
occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in
the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the
principal payable at the maturity of that note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market
value of that note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite
effects.

The European Union or one or more of its member states may, in the future, impose exchange controls and
modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of
euros at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any redemption payment or additional amounts with
respect to, the notes.

This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including,
in particular, the notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency.
You should consult your own financial and legal advisers as to the risks involved in an investment in the notes.

**In a lawsuit for payment on the notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk.**

The indenture is, and the notes will be, governed by the laws of the State of New York. Under New York law, a
New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euros.
However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry

36


-----

of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors would bear currency exchange
risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a significant amount of time. A federal
court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would
apply New York law.

In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S.
dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state
courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate
of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the
judgment and when the judgment is rendered.

**If certain changes to tax law were to occur, the Issuer would have the option to redeem the notes.**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as described under “Description of Notes—
Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions
on the payments on the notes, the Issuer may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. The Issuer is unable to determine whether such changes to any tax
laws will be enacted, but if such changes do occur, the notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option.

**Use of Proceeds**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering of the notes will be approximately $501.4 million, after
deducting estimated discounts and commissions to the initial purchasers and estimated fees and expenses payable
by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with cash on hand and future debt financings
to finance the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions. Pending use of the net proceeds from this
offering as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing accounts,
securities or similar investments.

**Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

_This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-_
_looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-_
_Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks_
_and assumptions associated with these statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our_
_historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this_
_offering memorandum. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of_
_results that may be expected for future periods, and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed_
_in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under_
_“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Overview**

**_Our Company_**

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion,
_Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Flexees,_
_Lilyette, Gear for Sports, Shock Absorber, Abanderado, Zorba and Rinbros. We design, manufacture, source and_
sell a broad range of basic apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, children’s underwear,
activewear, socks and hosiery. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by
units sold in most product categories in which we compete.

Founded in 1901, we were organized as a Maryland corporation in 2005 and spun off from Sara Lee Corporation
in 2006, at which time we became an independent, publicly-traded corporation. Since then, we have used
strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio. In November 2010, we expanded our activewear portfolio
through the acquisition of GearCo, Inc., known as Gear for Sports, a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in
collegiate bookstores and other channels. In October 2013, we acquired Maidenform Brands Inc., a global
intimate apparel company, including the brands Maidenform, Flexees and Lilyette. We acquired another portfolio
of strong brands including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Shock Absorber and Abanderado through the August
2014 acquisition of Hanes Europe Innerwear, a leading marketer of intimate apparel, hosiery and underwear in
Europe. Most recently, in April 2015, we acquired Knights Apparel, a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo
apparel primarily in the mass retail channel. We also recently announced the acquisitions of Champion Europe
and Pacific Brands. We believe these acquisitions will create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased
scale to serve retailers.

**_Our Segments_**

Our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for
financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and International. These segments are
organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution channel. Each segment has its
own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s businesses, but the segments share a
common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. The reportable segments are as follows:

    - Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of
intimate apparel, men’s underwear, panties, children’s underwear, socks and hosiery.

    - Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature to both retailers and
wholesalers, as well as licensed sports apparel and licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores, mass
retailers and other channels.

    - Direct to Consumer includes our Company-operated outlet stores, catalogs and website operations that
sell our branded products directly to consumers.

    - International primarily relates to the Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia geographic
locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.

42


-----

As a result of a shift in management responsibilities, we decided during the first quarter of 2016 to change the
reporting of certain segment-level financial information previously included in our public filings made with the
SEC, including (1) by moving our wholesale e-commerce business from our Direct to Consumer segment into
our Innerwear and Activewear segments and (2) changing how we allocate certain selling, general and
administrative expenses between segments. Only the financial results relating to segment information for the
fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016 and the fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2015 contained in this offering
memorandum and our consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been recast
to reflect these changes to the reporting of our segment-level financial information. The financial results relating
to segment information for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013
contained in this offering memorandum and our consolidated financial statements do not reflect these changes to
the reporting of our segment-level financial information.

**_Business and Industry Trends_**

_Inflation and Changing Prices_

Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products. While we do not own yarn
operations, we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Increases in the cost of cotton can result in
higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large-scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to
implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins. Decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower
margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased, particularly if there is
downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand, competition or other factors.

Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is
affected by, among other factors, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the
relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that
are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price
we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the
market price of cotton. Under our agreements with these suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the
cotton cost component of our yarn purchases. When we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these
agreements, interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of
yarn. The yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their
responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton
suppliers. However, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. The cost of cotton
used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 7% of our cost of sales in 2015. Costs incurred
today for materials and labor, including cotton, typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold
approximately six to nine months later.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our
ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing
process, such as oil-related commodities and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs,
such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Costs incurred for
materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold. In addition, a
significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the United States and declines in the
value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Increases in inflation may not be matched by
rises in consumer income, which also could have a negative impact on spending.

_Other Business and Industry Trends_

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based upon brand
name recognition, price, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. The majority of our core
styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design details. Some products, however,

43


-----

such as intimate apparel, activewear and sheer hosiery, do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation.
Our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers, as well as smaller
companies, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products
under private labels that compete directly with our brands.

Our top ten customers accounted for 56% of our net sales. Our largest customers in 2015 were Wal-Mart, Target
and Kohl’s Corporation (“Kohl’s”), which accounted for 23%, 15% and 5% of total sales, respectively. The
increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek
greater concessions in their purchase of our products, while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products.
To counteract these effects, it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through
investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially
in today’s challenging economic environment. Brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and
project the quality and value our customers demand.

Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two
ways; a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in
exchange rates can have on our published financial results. Similar to many multi-national corporations that
publish financial results in U.S. dollars, our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated
back into U.S. dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. A period of strengthening in
the U.S. dollar results in a negative impact to our published financial results (because it would take more units of
a local currency to convert into a dollar). The opposite is true during a period of weakening in the U.S. dollar.
Our biggest foreign currency exposure is the euro.

The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these
goods are purchased in U.S. dollars. The transaction impact from a strengthening dollar would be negative to our
financial results (because the U.S. dollar-based costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units,
which means a higher local-currency cost of goods, and in turn, a lower local-currency gross profit). The
transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases. However, during
periods of rapid change in exchange rates; pricing is unable to change quickly enough, therefore we hedge
against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates.

**_Our Key Business Strategies_**

Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost
supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs.

The first element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our brand power. We seek to drive modest sales growth
by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value. Our brands have a
strong heritage in the basic apparel industry. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market
position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete.

Internationally, our commercial markets include Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia, where we
believe a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the United States will be concentrated
over the next decade. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success.
Our design, research and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts
to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel
industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that
make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends. We also support our key
brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing campaigns.

The second element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is platform innovation. We are not interested in newness
or fashion, but rather focus on identifying the long-term megatrends that will impact our categories over the next

44


-----

five to 10 years. Once we have identified these trends, we utilize a disciplined big-idea process to put more
science into the art of apparel. Our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms. Our Tagless apparel
platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform and ComfortBlend and X-Temp fabric platforms incorporate big-idea
innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and
geographies. We are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply
chain in order to drive further economies of scale.

The third element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our low-cost global supply chain. We seek to expand
margins through optimizing our low-cost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs.
We believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater
manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design, marketing and customer management
resources than our smaller competitors. Our global supply chain spans across both the Western and Eastern
hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of
owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the
efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply. Our global
supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across
hemispheres, thereby diversifying our production risks. We have generated significant cost savings, margin
expansion and contributions to cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size, scale and
production capability.

We seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working
capital levels. Our capital allocation strategy is to effectively deploy our significant, consistent cash flow to
generate the best long-term returns for our shareholders. Our goal is to use our cash flow to fund capital
investments and dividends, leverage debt for acquisitions and use excess cash flow for share repurchases.

**_Recent Acquisitions_**

On April 7, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Champion Europe, which owns the
trademark for the Champion brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We have agreed to acquire the
privately held Champion Europe, based in Italy, in an all-cash transaction. The purchase price will be ten times
actual calendar 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to adjustment for
cash, debt and working capital. We believe the final purchase price will be between €190 million and €210
million. The acquisition, which is subject to certain closing conditions, is expected to close in mid-2016.

On April 27, 2016, we entered into a scheme implementation deed to acquire Pacific Brands in an all-cash
transaction. We will acquire Pacific Brands through a recommended court approved scheme of arrangement at a
purchase price of approximately $800 million, which equals AUD$1.15 per share of Pacific Brands stock, less
any special dividends paid by Pacific Brands prior to the closing. The acquisition, which is subject to certain
closing conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016.

Pacific Brands is the leading underwear and intimate apparel company in Australia, with total sales over
AUD$800 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2015. Pacific Brands currently has three
business units—Underwear, Sheridan and Tontine & Dunlop. The company has undergone significant
restructuring over the past two years to streamline its portfolio to focus on the core Underwear and Sheridan
businesses. We intend to divest the Tontine pillow business and Dunlop flooring business following the
acquisition because we do not consider these units to be part of Pacific Brands’ core business.

Of the core business, Underwear accounts for approximately three-fourths of Pacific Brands’ sales and includes
underwear, bras, socks, hosiery, babywear and outerwear. The Underwear group operates more than 150
company retail stores and retailer shop-in-shops. Pacific Brands’ biggest Underwear brand is the fast-growing
_Bonds, an iconic century-old brand that holds the No. 1 market share in Australia for men’s underwear, women’s_
underwear, children’s underwear, babywear and socks, as well as the No. 3 position in bras in Australia. In
addition, the Berlei brand of premium bras sold in department stores is No. 2 in overall bra market share in
Australia and No. 1 in sports bras in Australia.

We intend to finance the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions using a combination of the net
proceeds of this offering, cash on hand and future debt financings. For additional information on these
acquisitions, see “Summary—Recent Developments.”

**_Seasonality and Other Factors_**

Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. Generally, our diverse
range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. We
generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler
weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by
customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand.
Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal
notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year
depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a
planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers.
Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest
rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, gasoline prices, unemployment
trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside our
control. Consumers’ purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when
disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived
unfavorable economic conditions. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase
lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choose not to purchase
our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time.

Changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher
margin products, such as intimate apparel and men’s underwear, and lower margin products, such as activewear,
fluctuate from time to time. In addition, sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same
product category fluctuate from time to time. Our customers may change the mix of products ordered with
minimal notice to us, which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict. However, certain changes in
product sales mix are seasonal in nature, as sales of socks, hosiery and fleece products generally have higher
sales during the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather, back-toschool shopping and holidays, while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers’ preferences
and discretionary spending.

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales increased 1% during the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the following:

    - acquisition of Knights Apparel in April 2015, which added an incremental $21 million of net sales in
2016;

    - higher net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily driven by sales of basic apparel in the mass
merchant channel; and

    - continued growth in the Activewear segment within the licensed sports apparel business.

Offset by:

    - lower sales in the mid-tier and department store channel;

    - lower sales in our Direct to Consumer segment due to lower comparable store sales and the planned
reduction of our catalog distribution; and

    - unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency reductions,
consolidated net sales and International segment net sales increased 2% and increased 3%,
respectively.

**_Gross Profit_**

The increase in gross profit was attributable to a sales shift to higher margin products, reduced acquisition,
integration and other action related costs, supply chain efficiencies and benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate
strategy, which combines our brand power, our innovation platforms and our low cost supply chain to drive
margin expansion by increasing our price per unit and reducing our cost per unit. Included in gross profit in the
first quarters of 2016 and 2015 were charges of approximately $5 million and $14 million, respectively, related
to acquisition, integration and other action related costs.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 27.5% for the first quarter of
2016 compared to 29.5% in the same period of 2015. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses
were charges of $20 million and $29 million of acquisition, integration and other action related costs for the first
quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Exclusive of acquisition, integration and other action related costs and
the purchase of Knights Apparel, selling, general and administrative expenses were lower due to synergy benefits
from the integration of acquisitions, planned reduction of our catalog distribution and continued cost control.

**_Other Highlights_**

_Interest expense—higher by $5 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily_
due to higher debt balances to fund share repurchases and working capital needs. Our weighted average interest
rate on our outstanding debt was 3.59% during the first quarter of 2016, compared to 4.04% in the first quarter of
2015.

_Income tax expense—our effective income tax rate was 11% and 16% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015,_
respectively. The lower tax rate in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a lower
proportion of earnings attributed to domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign
subsidiaries.

The higher net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily resulted from stronger net sales within the mass

Increased operating profit was driven largely by increased sales and continued cost control offset by costs
associated with our inventory reduction related efforts.

in 2016; and

    - continued growth in our licensed sports apparel business.

    - a bankruptcy of a large sporting goods retailer; and

    - space shifts within our seasonal activewear business.

Operating profit within the Activewear segment increased primarily as a result of higher sales volume.

**_Corporate_**

Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and
other action related charges totaling $25 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $43 million for the
first quarter of 2015. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its
integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs,
certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information
technology), and similar charges. Foundational costs are expenses associated with building infrastructure to
support and integrate current and future acquisitions; primarily consisting of information technology spend.
Other costs relate to other items not included in the aforementioned categories such as charges incurred related to
the Target exit from Canada in the first quarter of 2015 and its related bankruptcy and other international
realignment and configuration activities. Maidenform acquisition and integration costs and foundational costs
were completed in 2015.

**_Net Sales_**

Higher net sales primarily due to the following:

    - incremental net sales of $445 million and $160 million, from our acquisitions of Hanes Europe
Innerwear in August 2014 and Knights Apparel in April 2015, respectively;

50


-----

    - growth in our Gear for Sports business within the college bookstore channel and Champion products in
mid-tier, department and sporting goods stores; and

    - price increases and strong performance from our ComfortBlend, X-Temp and ComfortFlex Fit
innovative platforms.

Offset by lower net sales resulting from:

    - impact from the 53rd week in 2014;

    - the exit of a significant retailer in Canada;

    - lower shipments in our basics products driven by inventory adjustments at a major mass retailer;

    - the impact of weather on retail traffic and seasonal product lines;

    - the planned exit of certain acquired private label programs; and

    - unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding this impact, consolidated net sales and
International segment net sales increased 9% and 54%, respectively.

**_Gross Profit_**

The increase in gross profit was attributable to results obtained from our recent acquisitions of Hanes Europe
Innerwear and Knights Apparel combined with our supply chain efficiencies, product pricing within our
intimates business and favorable product mix within our Activewear segment. Included within gross profit are
charges of approximately $63 million and $73 million related to acquisition, integration and other action related
costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.9% in 2015 compared to
25.2% in 2014. The higher selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to charges of
$203 million related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs in 2015, compared to $126 million
of acquisition, integration and other action related costs in 2014. Also included in 2015 were incremental selling,
general and administrative costs of $190 million and $21 million related to Hanes Europe Innerwear and Knights
Apparel, respectively. Exclusive of the impact of higher acquisition, integration and other action related costs and
the purchases of Hanes Europe Innerwear and Knights Apparel, selling, general and administrative expenses
were lower due to tight cost control and synergies gained from the Maidenform acquisition.

**_Other Highlights_**

_Interest expense—higher by $22 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher debt balances related_
to the acquisition of Knights Apparel and our investment in working capital. Our weighted average interest rate
on our outstanding debt was 3.75% during 2015, compared to 4.05% during 2014.

_Income tax expense—our effective income tax rate was 9.5% and 13.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The_
lower effective income tax rate in 2015 was primarily attributable to income tax benefits of approximately $56
million recognized in 2015 resulting from the completion of the IRS audit examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax
years and the remeasurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits. Offsetting these tax benefits, we elected to
repatriate approximately $124 million of current year foreign earnings. In 2014, there were net discrete tax
benefits of approximately $10 million primarily related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting
from the lapsing of domestic and foreign statutes of limitations.

The lower net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily resulted from the following:

    - lower shipments of basics products due to inventory adjustments at a major mass retailer;

    - the 53rd week in 2014;

    - impact of weather resulting in weaker holiday traffic at stores; and

and higher net sales by Gear for Sports in the college bookstore channel; and

    - higher net sales in our Champion branded product in the mid-tier and department stores channel and

Sales in the International segment were higher as a result of the following:

    - higher sales volume in Asia due to net space gains.

Offset by:

    - $95 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates; and

    - the exit of a significant retailer in Canada.

International segment operating margin decreased primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative
expenses associated with Hanes Europe Innerwear and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

**_Corporate_**

Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and
other action related charges totaling $266 million in 2015 as compared to $199 million in 2014. Acquisition and

associated with building infrastructure to support and integrate current and future acquisitions. Foundational
costs were completed in 2015. A significant majority of Other costs are non-cash and relate to the exit of our
commercial sales organization in the China market. The main factors that drove the decision to exit the China

market were primarily related to the fragmented underwear market and business practices for innerwear and
activewear in China that were not conducive to our wholesale business model. Exiting China is immaterial to our

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales were $697 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the following:

    - the acquisition of Maidenform in October 2013, which added an incremental $381 million of net sales
in 2014;

    - the acquisition of Hanes Europe Innerwear in August 2014, which added an incremental $291 million
of net sales, during the final four months of 2014;

    - higher net sales of 8% in our Activewear segment due to higher sales volume and net space gains at
retailers; and

    - an incremental $34 million in sales related to the 53rd week.

Offset by:

    - excluding the impact of Maidenform, we had lower net sales volume in our Innerwear segment; and

    - unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding this impact, consolidated net sales and
International segment net sales increased 16% and 69%, respectively.

54


-----

**_Gross Profit_**

Our gross profit increased $293 million in 2014. The increase in gross profit was attributable to supply chain
efficiencies and our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which combines our brand power, our innovation platforms and
our low cost supply chain to drive margin expansion by increasing our price per unit and reducing our cost per
unit. Included within gross profit in 2014 are charges of approximately $73 million related to acquisition,
integration and other action related costs.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 25.2% in 2014 compared to
23.7% in 2013. The higher selling, general and administrative expenses were attributable to charges of
approximately $126 million related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs. Additionally, we
incurred higher planned media spending and higher distribution costs due to increased sales volume in 2014
compared to 2013.

**_Other Highlights_**

_Interest expense—lower by $5 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the lower weighted average_
interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 4.05% during 2014 compared to
5.07% in 2013.

_Income tax expense—our effective income tax rate was 13.0% and 16.5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The_
lower effective income tax rate in 2014 was primarily attributable to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to
domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries. In 2014, there were net discrete
tax benefits of approximately $10 million primarily related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits
resulting from the lapsing of domestic and foreign statutes of limitations. In 2013, there were net discrete tax
benefits of approximately $20 million primarily related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting
from the lapsing of domestic and foreign statutes of limitations as well as the retroactive application of the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that was signed into law in January 2013.

The higher net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily resulted from the following:

    - incremental sales of Maidenform products;

    - higher sales in our basics product category, specifically in socks and womens’ panties, primarily due to
higher product pricing; and

    - higher sales in our licensed products, primarily due to higher sales volume.

Offset by:

    - lower sales in the intimates and hosiery product categories, excluding Maidenform products, as a result
of lower sales volume.

Supply chain efficiencies and our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continue to positively impact our Innerwear
segment margins as we are able to increase our price per unit with product innovations and reduce our cost per
unit. Offsetting the improvement were higher distribution costs and higher planned media spending.

Activewear sales increased due to the following:

    - higher sales in our Gear for Sports licensed apparel, primarily due to net space gains and higher point
of sales activity at the retail level;

    - higher sales for our Champion branded product in our retail channel, primarily due to net space gains at
retailers; and

    - higher sales for our Hanes branded product in both the retail channel and branded printwear, primarily
as a result of higher sales volume and new product introductions.

Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continues to positively impact our Activewear segment margins as we are able
to increase our price per unit with product innovations and reduce our cost per unit. Offsetting these benefits
were higher distribution costs and unfavorable product mix.

International segment operating margin increased primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by
foreign currency exchange rates.

**_Corporate_**

Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and
other action related charges totaling $199 million in 2014 as compared to $81 million in 2013. Acquisition and
integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These
costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility
closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges.
Foundational costs are expenses associated with building infrastructure to support and integrate current and
future acquisitions; primarily consisting of information technology spend. A significant majority of Other costs
are non-cash and relate to the exit of our commercial sales organization in the China market. The main factors
that drove the decision to exit the China market were primarily related to the fragmented underwear market and
business practices for innerwear and activewear in China that were not conducive to our wholesale business
model. Exiting China is immaterial to our consolidated financial results and inconsequential to the International
business.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity_**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under our Revolving Credit
Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility and international loan facilities.

At April 2, 2016, we had $182 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (after taking
into account outstanding letters of credit), $101 million of borrowing availability under our international loan
facilities, $332 million in cash and cash equivalents and no borrowing availability under our Accounts
Receivable Securitization Facility. After giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had
approximately $888.6 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility at April 2, 2016
(after taking into account outstanding letters of credit), which borrowings may be used to, among other things,
finance the acquisitions of Champion Europe and/or Pacific Brands. We currently believe that our existing cash
balances and cash generated by operations, together with our available credit capacity, will enable us to comply
with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.

The following have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity:

    - we have principal and interest obligations under out debt;

    - we acquired Knights Apparel in April 2015 and have announced our intent to acquire Champion
Europe mid-year 2016 and Pacific Brands in the third quarter of 2016, and we may pursue additional
strategic business acquisitions in the future;

    - we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs;

    - we made a $100 million contribution to our pension plans in January 2015 and a $40 million
contribution in January 2016;

    - we may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we
remit to the United States, which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate;

    - our board of directors has authorized a regular quarterly dividend; and

    - our board of directors has authorized share repurchases under our share repurchase program.

On May 6, 2016, we completed the sale of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of
$900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2024 and $900 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem in full our
outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, which have been called
for redemption on June 2, 2016 in accordance with their terms, and to repay $706.5 million of our outstanding
borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of our payment of the redemption price associated
with our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, we have discharged all of our obligations under the indenture governing
our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020.

**_Cash Requirements for Our Business_**

We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit
Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash
requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the
normal course of business, capital expenditures, maturities of debt and related interest payments, contributions to
our pension plans, repurchases of our stock and regular quarterly dividend payments. We believe we have
sufficient cash and available borrowings for our foreseeable liquidity needs.

-----

_Pension Plans_

In January 2016, we made a voluntary contribution of $40 million to our pension plans. As a result of this
contribution, our U.S. qualified pension plan is approximately 104% funded as of January 2, 2016 compared to
104% funded as of January 3, 2015, under the Pension Protection Act funding rules. We are not required to make
any additional cash contributions to our pension plans in 2016 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary.
We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions during 2016 to maintain certain funded levels. See
Note, “Defined Pension Benefit Plans,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this offering
memorandum for more information on the plan asset and pension expense components.

_Share Repurchase Program_

On April 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors granted authority for the repurchase of up to
40 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open-market transactions,
and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Additionally, management has been
granted authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in connection with share
repurchases, which will allow us to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock
trading window is otherwise closed for our company and certain of our officers and employees pursuant to our
insider trading policy. The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution
caused by the exercise of options and vesting of stock unit awards, as well as utilize excess cash flow to generate
shareholder value. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may
be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.

_Dividends_

As part of our cash deployment strategy, in 2013, our board of directors declared our first dividends of $0.05 per
share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2013. Prior to that declaration, we had not paid a cash
dividend on our common stock.

In 2014, our board of directors declared dividends of $0.075 per share on outstanding common stock which were
paid in 2014.

In January 2015, April 2015, July 2015 and October 2015, our board of directors declared dividends of $0.10 per
share on outstanding common stock which were paid on March 3, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 9, 2015 and
December 8, 2015. In addition, our board of directors authorized a four-for-one stock split in the form of a 300%
stock dividend, which was implemented on March 3, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on
February 9, 2015.

In January 2016, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, which was paid
in March 2016. In April 2016, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, to
be paid June 7, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2016.

estimated net proceeds from the offering as set forth in “Use of Proceeds,” and the Refinancing
Transactions, the payment schedule on debt obligations, excluding interest, would have been $3.85 billion at
April 2, 2016, $247.7 million in fiscal 2016, $154.9 million in fiscal 2017-2018, $619.5 million in fiscal
2019-2020 and $2.83 billion in fiscal 2021 and thereafter.
(2) Represents the projected payment for long-term liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for
certain employee benefit claims, royalty-bearing license agreement payments, deferred compensation,
capital leases and uncertain tax positions.

Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table above because it is
uncertain whether or when further contributions will be required. We are not required to make any additional
cash contributions to our pension plans in 2016 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary. In January
2016, we made a voluntary contribution of $40 million. We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions
during 2016 to maintain certain funded levels.

_Operating Activities_

Our overall liquidity is primarily driven by our strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is
dependent on net income and changes in working capital. We typically use cash during the first half of the year
and generate most of our cash flow in the second half of the year. As compared to prior year, the lower net cash
from operating activities is due to changes in working capital, specifically related to accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, partially offset by a smaller voluntary pension contribution in the first quarter of 2016 of $40
million compared to $100 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in inventory in the first quarter is in
line with our normal seasonal build as we typically build inventory unit levels to support the back-to-school
shopping season. We have initiated inventory reduction efforts in the first quarter of 2016 that will continue
through the second quarter and expected to generate cash flow in the second half of 2016. Although net income
increased in 2015 from improved operating performance, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased in
2015 compared to 2014 due to the build in inventory levels in 2015; a $100 million pension contribution in 2015
and decreased accounts receivable collections in 2015 due to the timing of sales within the fourth quarter yearover-year.

_Investing Activities_

The lower net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ended April 2, 2016 was the result of lower
capital spending and increased cash proceeds from sale of assets in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
Offsetting, in part, the aforementioned favorable investing cash flow activity was the investment to re-acquire the
remainder of the rights to Champion in Japan from Goldwin, Inc. During 2015, the lower net cash used for
investing activities was primarily the result of the net cash of $193 million used for the acquisition of Knights
Apparel in April 2015 as compared to the net cash used for the acquisition of Hanes Europe Innerwear in August
2014 of $360 million and 2014 proceeds from the sale of investments of $64 million, offset by higher net capital
expenditures of $27 million in 2015.

_Financing Activities_

The lower net cash from financing activities during the quarter ended April 2, 2016 was primarily the result of
our share repurchases in the quarter, offset by higher net borrowings on our loan facilities, specifically due to
new borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. During 2015, the higher net cash from financing
activities was primarily the result of higher net cash borrowings on our loan facilities, specifically new
borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The decision to increase our net borrowings was driven by
our cash deployment strategy and utilized for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends in order to
continue generating shareholder value.

61


-----

**_Financing Arrangements_**

In March 2016, we amended our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. This amendment primarily
extended the termination date to March 2017 and changed the borrowing capacity from a fixed to a varying limit
throughout the year, in order to minimize fees for our unused portion of the facility.

As of April 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities. We continue
to monitor our covenant compliance carefully in this difficult economic environment. We expect to maintain
compliance with our covenants during 2016, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed
under the heading “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum could cause noncompliance.

We have significant liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities. We maintain a Senior
Secured Credit Facility consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility of $1,000,000, a $725,000 Term Loan A
Facility, a $425,000 Term Loan B Facility and a €363,000 Euro Term Loan Facility. Our Accounts Receivable
Securitization Facility provides for up to $275,000 in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to
the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. As of April 2, 2016,
$182,005 of our Revolving Credit Facility was available for borrowing. Refer to Note 10, “Debt” in the notes to
our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and
December 28, 2013 and Note 6, “Debt” in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, each of which is included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, for a complete overview of our credit facilities.

_Notes Payable_

Notes payable were $115 million at April 2, 2016 and $118 million at January 2, 2016. At April 2, 2016, we had
$101 million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities.

**_Undistributed Earnings from Foreign Subsidiaries_**

As of January 2, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was
approximately $2.7 billion, of which $319 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries
whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested, and less than $1 million of cash and cash
equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently
reinvested. Our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed
earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations. We
reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other
sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be
considered to be reinvested permanently.

We repatriated $124 million, $15 million and $10 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from earnings
generated in such years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has
been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2016 will be determined, based upon a
variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the
cash flow needs we have in the U.S., such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations. The
majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at year-end, although
we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business. When we repatriate funds
to the U.S., we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of any foreign
tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against U.S. income tax. There was a cost of $43
million, $1 million and $1 million in additional U.S. federal income taxes in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating
results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, which are included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and
assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We
evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our
evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of
operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve
the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements, or are
the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are described below:

**_Sales Recognition and Incentives_**

We recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed or
determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the
receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment. We record provisions for any
uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information. Our
management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience.

Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—(d) Sales Recognition and Incentives” in the notes to our
audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28,
2013, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, describes a variety of sales incentives that we
offer to resellers and consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these incentives requires, in many cases,
estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates. We use historical data for similar transactions to
estimate the cost of current incentive programs. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes
adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information. We classify the costs associated with
cooperative advertising as a reduction of “Net sales” in our consolidated statements of income included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Accounts Receivable Valuation_**

Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers. We carry our accounts receivable at their
net realizable value. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination
of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers’ financial strength, credit
standing and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to
adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment
by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables.
Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the “Selling, general and administrative
expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are
primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales” line of our consolidated statements of income included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes
adjustments based upon actual experience. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of
our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial
condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a large reserve
might be required. The amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad
debts.

63


-----

**_Inventory Valuation_**

We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the firstin, first-out, or “FIFO,” method for our inventories. We carry obsolete, damaged and excess inventory at the net
realizable value, which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and our
future marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there
are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors and other conditions underlying the
net realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction in the carrying amount of
an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later
period. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the
financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional
inventory write-downs in the future.

Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are
reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when
the related inventory item is sold.

**_Income Taxes_**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities, as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, at
tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on
possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that
all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets,
which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.

We have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings
that is permanently reinvested in their respective foreign jurisdictions. If we decided to remit those earnings to
the U.S. in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements, our federal income tax
provision and effective tax rate could be impacted.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax
positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax
audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and
regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum in the period in which these events occur.

**_Stock Compensation_**

We established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and restated) (the “Omnibus Incentive
Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock
units, performance shares and cash to our employees, non-employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries
to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees. Stock-based
compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value and is recognized as expense over the
requisite service period. We estimate forfeitures for stock-based awards granted that are not expected to vest. If
any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly, our stock-based compensation expense could be
materially different in the future.

64


-----

**_Defined Benefit Pension Plans_**

For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan obligations, plan assets and how we measure the amount of
these costs, see Note 16, “Defined Benefit Pension Plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, which are included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized
on our balance sheet. Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed
results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income. We measure
the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end.

The net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions, the most
significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset return. The net periodic pension income
or expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from
actuarial assumptions, are amortized over the average future expected life of participants. As benefits under the
Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan are frozen, year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to
be material and not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows:

    - in determining the discount rate, we utilized the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median Curve (rounded to the
nearest 10 basis points) in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the
expected cash flows for each plan. Beginning in 2016, we began utilizing specific spot rates along the
full yield curve in our determination of discount rates, for our U.S. defined benefit plans, in order to
determine our interest rate and match to the relevant cash flows for the plans. This change should
improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot
rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs.

    - salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management
actions. The salary increase assumption only applies to the Canadian plans, certain Hanes Europe
Innerwear plans and portions of the Hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under these
plans are not frozen. The benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan were frozen as of
December 31, 2005.

    - in determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend
between assuming the historical long-term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict
the future returns of similar investments, and the utilization of forward-looking assumptions.

    - retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to
estimate mortality. In 2015, the tables used as a basis for the mortality assumption were updated from

**_Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles_**

Trademarks, license agreements, customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary
identifiable intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful
lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an
identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected
changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows.
As of January 2, 2016, the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was $701 million,
of which we are amortizing a balance of $211 million. We anticipate that our amortization expense for 2016 will
be $20 million.

We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that
used to evaluate asset amortization described below under “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—
Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets not
subject to amortization for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and more
often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets, we
compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Fair values of intangible assets are primarily
based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset. We recognize an impairment loss for the
amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.

**_Goodwill_**

As of January 2, 2016, we had $834 million of goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for
impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur. The timing of our annual goodwill
impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. The estimated fair values significantly exceeded the
carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and no impairment of
goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2015.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2015, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units. We relied
on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount
anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. As
discussed above under “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Trademarks and Other Identifiable
Intangibles,” there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the
assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may
occur in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known.

**_Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations_**

We account for business combinations using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate the cost of an
acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
We recognize the excess of an acquired business’ cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as
goodwill. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.
We generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable
intangibles, consulting actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined
benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims.

**_Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment_**

We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost, and we compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates,
engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future business plans and the period over which the asset will
economically benefit us, which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life. Our policies require that we

66


-----

periodically review our assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future
utilization. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated
depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods.

We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value
may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in business climate, several periods of
operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group
will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We evaluate an asset’s recoverability by comparing the asset
or asset group’s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset
group will generate. If we determine that an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use, we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying
amount over its remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if
circumstances change.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**

For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 2, 2016,
January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 and Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in the notes to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015,
each of which is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our
risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis and value
at risk estimations.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase some
raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies.
Our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the euro, Canadian dollar, Australian
dollar, Mexican peso and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to
hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis technique has been
used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our
forward and option contracts. At January 2, 2016, the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative
instruments, assuming a 10% adverse change in the underlying currency price, was $26 million.

**_Interest Rates_**

Our debt under the Revolving Credit Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, Term Loan A
Facility, Term Loan B Facility, Euro Term Loan and Other International Debt bears interest at variable rates. As
a result, we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt.
Approximately 40% of our total debt outstanding at January 2, 2016 is at a fixed rate. A 25-basis point movement
in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of January 2, 2016 would only result in a
change in annual interest expense of approximately $4 million.

67


-----

**_Commodities_**

We are exposed to commodity price fluctuations primarily as a result of the cost of materials that are used in our
manufacturing process. Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products. Under
our current agreements with our primary yarn suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost
component of our yarn purchases so that the suppliers bear the risk of cotton price fluctuation for the specified
yarn volume and interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact our costs. However, our business can be
affected by sustained dramatic movements in cotton prices.

In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use
to manufacture our products, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam, as well as affect our
transportation and utility costs. We generally purchase raw materials at market prices.

**Business**

**Our Company**

We are a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the
world’s strongest apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali, JMS/Just My
_Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Flexees, Lilyette and Gear for Sports._

We sell bras, panties, shapewear, hosiery, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, socks, T-shirts and other
activewear in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate
apparel, male underwear and children’s underwear than any other company. Unlike most apparel companies, we
primarily operate our own manufacturing facilities. More than 80% of the apparel units that we sell in the United
States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

We have a long history of innovation, product excellence and brand recognition. In fact, more than 80% of U.S.
households have our products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports
bra and we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex). We are now using our Innovate-toElevate strategy to integrate our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain
to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex
Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform and temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform incorporate bigidea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and
geographies.

Founded in 1901, we were organized as a Maryland corporation in 2005 and spun off from Sara Lee Corporation
in 2006, at which time we became an independent, publicly-traded corporation. Since then, we have used
strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio. In November 2010, we expanded our activewear portfolio
through the acquisition of GearCo, Inc., known as Gear for Sports, a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in
collegiate bookstores and other channels. In October 2013, we acquired Maidenform Brands Inc., a global
intimate apparel company, including the brands Maidenform, Flexees and Lilyette. We acquired another portfolio
of strong brands including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Shock Absorber and Abanderado through the August
2014 acquisition of Hanes Europe Innerwear, a leading marketer of intimate apparel, hosiery and underwear in
Europe. In April 2015, we acquired Knights Holdco, Inc., a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel
primarily in the mass retail channel. As described under “Summary—Recent Developments,” in April 2016 we
entered into agreements to acquire Champion Europe, which owns the trademark for the Champion brand in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as Pacific Brands, the leading underwear and intimate apparel
company in Australia. We believe these acquisitions will create growth and cost savings opportunities and
increased scale to serve retailers.

We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good
corporate responsibility program for community and environmental improvement. We are the only apparel
producer to ever be honored by the Great Place to Work Institute for its workplace practices in Central America
and the Caribbean, and in 2015 were ranked No. 160 on the Forbes magazine list of America’s Best Employers.
For seven consecutive years, Hanesbrands has won the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star
sustained excellence/partner of the year award—the only apparel company to earn sustained excellence honors.
In 2015, we ranked No. 246 on Newsweek magazine’s green list of 500 largest U.S. companies.

**Our Brands and Operations**

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across
a broad range of basic apparel products. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market
position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete. Each of our brands has a unique
consumer positioning that distinguishes it from its competitors and guides its advertising and product
development.

_Champion is our second-largest brand. For nearly 100 years, Champion has been outfitting athletes in authentic,_
high-quality athletic apparel, including high-performance sports bras, team uniforms and gym essentials like
classic T-shirts, mesh shorts and fleece hoodies. An industry leader in quality, design and performance
innovation, Champion provides athletes with mobility, durability and up-to-date styles—in and out of the gym,
on and off the field. Champion has also collaborated on premium apparel items through an exclusive collection
with Todd Snyder, a limited edition men’s apparel line for Urban Outfitters and custom specialty items for
Supreme. In addition, we distribute a full line of men’s, women’s and children’s C9 by Champion products
exclusively through Target stores. As described under “Summary—Recent developments,” we recently entered
into an agreement to acquire Champion Europe, which owns the trademark for the Champion brand in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa.

Our brand portfolio also includes a number of iconic intimate apparel brands: Bali offers a range of bras, panties
and shapewear sold in the department store channel and is the number one bra brand in department stores.
_Playtex is the United States’ number one plus-size bra brand. Playtex offers superior fit and support for women_
of all sizes and is sold everywhere from mass merchandise retailers to department stores. DIM is a flagship
European brand and a market leader in women’s underwear, hosiery and intimate apparel in France. Maidenform
is the number one shapewear brand in the United States and has been trusted for modern, sensual style in bras,
panties and shapewear since 1922. As described under “Summary—Recent developments,” we recently entered
into an agreement to acquire Pacific Brands, which owns the Bonds brand, an iconic century-old brand that holds
the No. 1 market share in Australia for men’s underwear, women’s underwear, children’s underwear, babywear
and socks, as well as the No. 3 position in Australia in bras.

In addition, we offer a variety of products under the following well-known brands: JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/
_Nur Der, L’eggs, Wonderbra, Gear for Sports, Lilyette and Loveable._

These brands serve to round out our product offerings, allowing us to give consumers a variety of options to meet
their diverse needs.

underwear in France and Spain, and in hosiery in France and Germany. Our largest international markets are
Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia.

**Customers and Distribution Channels**

In 2015, approximately 80% of our net sales were to customers in the United States and approximately 20% were
to customers outside the United States. Domestically, almost 87% of our net sales were wholesale sales to
retailers, 9% were direct to consumers and 4% were wholesale sales to wholesalers and third party embellishers.
We have well-established relationships with some of the largest apparel retailers in the world. Our largest
customers are Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, accounting for 23%, 15% and 5%, respectively, of our total net sales
in 2015. As is common in the basic apparel industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that obligate
our customers to purchase our products. However, all of our key customer relationships have been in place for 10
years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with sales that exceed 10% of any individual
segment’s sales. In our Innerwear segment, Wal-Mart accounted for 35% of net sales and Target accounted for
17% of net sales during 2015. In our Activewear segment, Target accounted for 28% of net sales and Wal-Mart
accounted for 21% of net sales.

Sales to the mass merchant channel in the United States accounted for approximately 49% of our net sales in
2015. We sell all of our product categories in this channel, including our Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Maidenform
and JMS/Just My Size brands, as well as licensed logo apparel. Mass merchants feature high-volume, low-cost
sales of basic apparel items along with a diverse variety of consumer goods products, such as grocery and drug
products and other hard lines, and are characterized by large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target. Our largest
mass merchant customer is Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 23% of our total net sales in 2015.

Sales to the mid-tier and department stores channel in the United States accounted for approximately 15% of our
net sales in 2015. Mid-tier stores target a higher-income consumer than mass merchants, focus more of their sales
on apparel items rather than other consumer goods such as grocery and drug products and are characterized by
large retailers such as Kohl’s, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Sears Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our
product categories in this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income consumers and carry more
high-end, fashion conscious products than mid-tier stores or mass merchants and tend to operate in higherincome areas and commercial centers. Traditional department stores are characterized by large retailers such as
Macy’s, Inc. and Belk, Inc. We sell products in our intimate apparel, underwear, socks, hosiery and activewear
categories through department stores. We also sell products in the e-commerce environment through our owned
e-commerce websites and through e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.

Sales in our Direct to Consumer segment accounted for approximately 7% of our net sales in 2015. We sell our
branded products directly to consumers through our 252 domestic outlet stores, as well as our websites operating
under the Hanes, One Hanes Place, JMS/Just My Size, Champion and Maidenform names. Our outlet stores are
value-based, offering the consumer a savings of 25% to 40% off suggested retail prices, and sell first-quality,
excess, post-season, obsolete and slightly imperfect products. Our websites, supported by emails, address the
growing e-commerce channel that characterizes today’s 24/7 retail environment. Our websites recorded
36 million user sessions in 2015, with 5.8 million consumers receiving our emails.

Sales in our International segment represented approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015, and included sales in
Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Our largest
international markets are Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. We also have offices in each of
these markets, as well as the Philippines, Thailand, Argentina, South Africa and Central America. Internationally,
the majority of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers. For more information about our sales on a

geographic basis, see Note 20, “Geographic Area Information” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, which are included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Sales in other channels in the United States represented approximately 9% of our net sales in 2015. We sell Tshirts, golf and sport shirts and fleece sweatshirts to wholesalers and third party embellishers primarily under our
_Hanes, Champion and Hanes Beefy-T brands. We also sell a significant range of our underwear, activewear and_
socks products under the Champion brand to wholesale clubs, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation, and
sporting goods stores, such as The Sports Authority, Inc. We sell primarily legwear and underwear products
under the Hanes and L’eggs brands to food, drug and variety stores. We also sell licensed logo apparel in
collegiate bookstores. We sell products that span across our Innerwear and Activewear segments to the U.S.
military for sale to servicemen and servicewomen and through discount retailers, such as the Dollar General
Corporation and Family Dollar Stores, Inc.

**Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution**

During 2015, approximately 65% of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a
combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who
perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We sourced the
remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our
designs. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply, we
consider a number of factors, including labor, local operating costs, quality, regional infrastructure, applicable
quotas and duties and freight costs. We believe that our balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a
combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases
the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply.

**_Finished Goods that are Manufactured by Hanesbrands_**

The manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from
suppliers. The principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics. Cotton and synthetic
materials are typically spun into yarn, which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics. We source
all of our yarn requirements from large-scale domestic and international suppliers. To a lesser extent, we
purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production. In
addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we use thread, narrow elastic and trim for product
identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace. These fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products, either by us
or by third party contractors. We currently operate 47 manufacturing facilities. Most of our cutting and sewing
operations are strategically located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. Alternate sources of these
materials and services are readily available.

**_Finished Goods that are Manufactured by Third Parties_**

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source finished goods we design from third-party
manufacturers, also referred to as “turnkey products.” Many of these turnkey products are sourced from
international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Asia.

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards. Further, all contractors and
third-party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines.
These requirements provide strict standards that, among other things, cover hours of work, age of workers, health
and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and Hanesbrands’ standards. Each new supplier must be
inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf.
We audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records. In addition to our
audit procedures, many of our suppliers are certified by the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, or
“WRAP,” program. WRAP uses third-party, independent audit firms and requires factory-by-factory
certification. We are also a fully accredited participating company in the Fair Labor Association.

73


-----

**_Distribution_**

As of January 2, 2016, we distributed our products from 37 distribution centers. These facilities include 16
facilities located in the United States and 21 facilities located outside the United States in regions where we
manufacture our products. We internally manage and operate 26 of these facilities, and we use third party
logistics providers who operate the other 11 facilities on our behalf. International distribution operations use a
combination of third party logistics providers, as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to distribute
goods to our various international markets.

**Inventory**

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future success. Because our customers generally do not
purchase our products under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order basis, effective inventory
management requires close coordination with the customer base. We seek to ensure that products are available to meet
customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels. We employ various types of inventory management
techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning, supplier-managed inventory, key event management
and various forms of replenishment management processes. Our supplier-managed inventory initiative is intended to
shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption, freeing up cash and improving
response time. We have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with
customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain. We also have professionals within the
customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers’
planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally, within our supply chain
organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and
specific production plans. These individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory
investment/exposure with customer service targets.

**Seasonality and Other Factors**

Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For instance, we generally
have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which
benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some
mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales levels in any period are also impacted
by customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our
customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to
us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the
timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

**Product Innovation and Marketing**

A significant component of our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our strong product research
and development and innovation capabilities. From 2013 to 2015, we spent nearly $177 million on design,
research and product development, including the development of new and improved products.

We use a disciplined, consumer-driven approach to direct our product innovation and marketing efforts. We seek
to identify relevant consumer insights and long-term megatrends that will impact our product categories over the
next five to ten years. We focus our innovation efforts on big-idea platforms that span brands, product categories,
business segments, distribution channels and geographies. In addition, we concentrate on margin accretive
product innovations where we can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale.
Examples of our product innovation platforms include:

    - Tagless: Over a decade ago, we launched Hanes Tagless Tees that deliver superior softness without the
itch and irritation of a tag. In 2012, our consumer-driven innovation process led us to expand this
platform to the male underwear bottom category where research indicated that itchy tags were the
number two consumer complaint. The Tagless platform also taps into the power of our supply chain,
generating significant cost savings and allowing us to expand gross margins.

74


-----

    - ComfortBlend: ComfortBlend, our fabric innovation that combines cotton and synthetic yarns for
products that are softer, shrink less and dry faster, is an outgrowth of the performance fabric
megatrend. In developing ComfortBlend, we worked through each step of the big idea process, testing
the concept, the product and the advertising. We introduced Hanes men’s ComfortBlend underwear in
2012 with exceptional results and have now expanded this platform to socks, children’s underwear and
panties.

    - ComfortFlex Fit: Our ComfortFlex Fit platform is another example of our consumer-driven innovation
process, where research indicated the two most significant consumer complaints in the bra category
were that the consumer could not find the right size and that the consumer could not find a comfortable
bra. ComfortFlex Fit effectively addresses both concerns by combining a simplified shopping system
that eliminates the complicated cup-and-band combinations of traditional bra sizing systems with a
more comfortable, flexible fit. We have successfully leveraged the ComfortFlex Fit platform across our
_Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, and JMS/Just My Size brands where it is driving incremental_
purchases in a category where consumers typically buy only a little over three bras per year.

    - X-Temp: X-Temp is our newest platform and brings a new level of technology and comfort to basic
apparel. Hanes and Champion X-Temp garments are designed to keep consumers cooler and drier by
increasing the rate of evaporation when body temperature rises and reducing the rate of evaporation as
body temperature cools. The X-Temp platform was successfully introduced in Hanes men’s underwear
and men’s socks in 2013 and expanded to women’s socks, panties, bras, legwear, base layer and
children’s underwear and socks in 2014. Champion Vapor with X-Temp technology was introduced in
men’s and women’s activewear in 2013 and expanded to team practicewear and branded printwear in
2014.

Driving innovation platforms across categories is a major element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as it
enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We believe that the strength of our
consumer insights, our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated marketing give us a competitive
advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace. Effectively marketing these innovations also accrues benefits
back to our supply chain. Driving higher volume helps us to leverage scale and drive costs down even further,
increasing margins while funding additional marketing support for our brands and products so we can continue to
reinvest in product innovation.

In 2015, our broad-reach marketing efforts included:

    - national advertising for our flagship Hanes brand starring Michael Jordan highlighting our Hanes
Tagless tees and underwear;

    - a cross-category, multi-media Hanes advertising campaign designed to build awareness of our
revolutionary X-Temp cooling technology;

    - television and social media advertising featuring our ComfortFlex Fit bras by Hanes and Bali; and

    - continued advertising support for our Champion brand, highlighting the new Absolute Sports Bra with
SmoothTec band and our Champion Vapor fast-dying performance apparel.

**Competition**

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand,
comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign
manufacturers. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., competes with us across most of
our segments through its own offerings and those of its Russell Corporation and Vanity Fair Intimates offerings.
Other competitors in our Innerwear segment include Limited Brands, Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret brand and Jockey
International, Inc. Other competitors in our Activewear segment include various private label and controlled
brands sold by many of our customers, as well as Gildan Activewear, Inc. and Gap Inc. Large European intimate

apparel distributors such as Triumph International and Calzedonia S.p.A Group compete with us in our
International segment. We also compete with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments,
including our International segment. Additionally, department stores and other retailers, including many of our
customers, market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Our
competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading market positions, our high-volume, core products
focus, our significant scale of operations, our global supply chain and our strong customer relationships. We
continually strive to improve in each of these areas.

**Intellectual Property**

We market our products under hundreds of trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries
around the world, the most widely recognized of which are Hanes, Champion, C9 by Champion, Maidenform,
_Playtex, Bali, DIM, JMS/Just My Size, L’eggs, Duofold, Nur Die/Nur Der, Wonderbra, Gear for Sports, Lilyette,_
_Lovable, Rinbros, Shock Absorber, Abanderado and Zorba. Some of our products are sold under trademarks that_
have been licensed from third parties, such as Polo Ralph Lauren (for men’s underwear) and Donna Karan and
DKNY (for intimate apparel).

Some of our own trademarks are licensed to third parties, such as Champion for athletic-oriented accessories. In
the United States and Canada, the Playtex trademark is owned by Playtex Marketing Corporation, of which we
own a 50% interest and which grants to us a perpetual royalty-free license to the Playtex trademark on and in
connection with the sale of apparel in the United States and Canada. The other 50% interest in Playtex Marketing
Corporation is owned by Playtex Products, LLC, an unrelated third party, whose affiliate, Edgewell Personal
Care Brands, LLC, has a perpetual royalty-free license to the Playtex trademark on and in connection with the
sale of non-apparel products in the United States and Canada. Outside the United States and Canada, we own the
_Playtex trademark and perpetually license such trademark to Edgewell Personal Care Brands, LLC for non-_
apparel products. Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We
aggressively protect these trademarks from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures, including
court actions and administrative proceedings.

Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained. Most of the trademarks in our portfolio, including our core brands, are
covered by trademark registrations in the countries of the world in which we do business, in addition to many
other jurisdictions around the world, with a registration period of ten years in most countries. Generally,
trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We have an active
program designed to ensure that our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected and maintained. We plan to
continue to use all of our core trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such trademarks as needed. We
also own a number of copyrights.

Most of our copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are
the subject of a number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office.

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are
the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any
single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how
that we have not patented.

**Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters**

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those
promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable
Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products
Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Some of our international businesses are

76


-----

subject to similar laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to
various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or
become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities,
operations and products that may have adverse environmental and health and safety effects, including laws and
regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and
workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties
and criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or petroleum releases at certain of our facilities
and are working with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and address such releases. We also
have been identified as a “potentially responsible party” at certain waste disposal sites undergoing investigation
and cleanup under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated, we have accrued amounts in
our balance sheet for losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our
remedial environmental obligations historically have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not
aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital
expenditures in connection with such compliance.

**Corporate Social Responsibility**

Hanesbrands conducts business around the world in a highly ethical manner. We are protective of our strong
reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility and proud of our significant achievements in the
areas of environmental stewardship, workplace quality and community building.

We call our corporate social responsibility program “Hanes for Good” because adhering to responsible and
sustainable business practices is good for our company, good for our employees, good for our communities and
good for our investors. We own the majority of our supply chain and have more direct control over how we do
business than many of our competitors. In fact, more than 80% of the apparel we sell in the United States is
produced in facilities that we operate or control. We also have an industry-leading compliance program that helps
to ensure our business partners live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves.

We have been recognized for our socially responsible business practices by such organizations as the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, corporate responsibility advocate As You Sow, social
compliance rating group Free2Work, the United Way and others. We are members of the Fair Labor Association,
Sustainable Apparel Coalition, The Sustainability Consortium and Corporate Eco Forum.

We have made significant progress across a range of corporate social responsibility issues, but we recognize that
there is always room for improvement. We pride ourselves on listening to others outside our company and
reacting quickly and responsibly if issues emerge. We hope to continue making a positive and lasting
contribution to our world in the years to come.

**Employees**

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately 65,300 employees, approximately 7,700 of whom were located in
the United States. As of January 2, 2016, approximately 30 employees in the United States were covered by
collective bargaining agreements. A significant portion of our employees based in foreign countries are
represented by works councils or unions or subject to trade-sponsored or governmental agreements. We believe
our relationships with our employees are good.

We own and lease properties supporting our administrative, manufacturing, distribution and direct outlet
activities. As of January 2, 2016, we owned and leased properties in 37 countries, including 47 manufacturing

Rico and 144 retail and outlet stores internationally, most of which are leased under five-year, renewable lease
agreements and several of which are leased under 10-year agreements. We believe that our facilities, as well as
equipment, are in good condition and meet our current business needs.

We own our approximately 470,000 square-foot headquarters located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which
houses our various sales, marketing and corporate business functions. Research and development as well as
certain product-design functions also are located in Winston-Salem, while other design functions are located in a
mix of leased and owned facilities in New York City and Lenexa, Kansas.

Our products are manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and
operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as
cutting and/or sewing. We source the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply
us with finished products based on our designs. Our most significant manufacturing facilities include an
approximately 1.1 million square-foot owned facility located in San Juan Opico, El Salvador, an approximately
1.1 million square-foot owned facility located in Nanjing, China and an approximately 600,000 square-foot
owned facility located in Bonao, Dominican Republic. We distribute our products from 37 distribution centers.
These facilities include 16 facilities located in the United States and 21 facilities located outside the United States
in regions where we manufacture our products. Our most significant distribution facilities include an
approximately 1.3 million square-foot leased facility located in Perris, California, an approximately 0.9 million
square-foot leased facility located in Rural Hall, North Carolina and an approximately 0.7 million square-foot
owned facility located in Martinsville, Virginia.

**Description of Other Indebtedness**

_The following is a summary of certain provisions of the instruments evidencing our material indebtedness. This_
_summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of_
_the provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not otherwise defined_
_in this offering memorandum._

**Senior Secured Credit Facility**

On April 29, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, which consists of (1) a
$1.0 billion revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (2) a $725 million term loan a facility (the
“Term Loan A Facility”), (3) a $425 million term loan b facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”) and (4) a
€363 million term loan b facility (the “Euro Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Term Loan A Facility
and the Term Loan B Facility, the “Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the
“Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The proceeds of the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility were
used to refinance then-existing revolving borrowings under our prior senior secured credit facility, pay fees and
expenses in connection with the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.
The proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility are denominated in Euros and were utilized in part to purchase
Hanes Europe Innerwear. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes
and working capital needs. The Term Loan A Facility matures in April 2020, the Term Loan B Facility matures
in April 2022, the Euro Term Loan Facility matures in August 2021 and the Revolving Credit Facility matures in
April 2020. As of April 2, 2016, the principal balance outstanding of the Term Loan A Facility was $696.3
million, the Term Loan B Facility was $420.8 million and the Euro Term Loan Facility was $117.3 million. As of
April 2, 2016, we had $802.5 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (and $182.0 million
available for future borrowings), and, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had
approximately $96.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (and approximately $888.6 million
available for future borrowings, which may be used to, among other things, finance the acquisitions of Champion
Europe and/or Pacific Brands).

**_Interest_**

At our option, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B
Facility bear interest based on the LIBOR rate or the “base rate” plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The
applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility is determined by reference to a
leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, ranging from a maximum of 2.00% in
the case of LIBOR-based loans and 1.00% in the case of Base Rate loans if our leverage ratio is greater than or
equal to 4.00 to 1, and will step down in 0.25% increments to a minimum of 1.25% in the case of LIBOR-based
loans and 0.25% in the case of Base Rate loans if our leverage ratio is less than 2.50 to 1. The applicable margin
under the Term Loan B Facility is 2.50% in the case of LIBOR-based loans and 1.50% in the case of Base Rate
loans. The Euro Term Loan Facility accrues interest utilizing the EURIBOR rate (as defined in the Senior
Secured Credit Facility) plus 2.75%.

**_Payment Terms_**

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity. Outstanding borrowings
under the Term Loan A Facility are repayable in equal quarterly installments in the following annual
percentages, with the remainder of the outstanding principal to be repaid at maturity: year one, 5.0%; year two,
7.5%; years three and four, 10.0%; and year five, 15.0%. Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B
Facility are repayable in 0.25% quarterly installments, with the remainder of the outstanding principal to be
repaid at maturity. Outstanding borrowings under the Euro Term Loan Facility are repayable in quarterly
payments of 0.25% of the original borrowings, with the remainder of the outstanding principle due at maturity.

85


-----

**_Letters of Credit; Swingline Loans_**

A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuances of letters of credit and the making of
swingline loans, and any such issuance of letters of credit or making of a swingline loan will reduce the amount
available under the Revolving Credit Facility. At our option, we may add one or more term loan facilities or
increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility so long as certain conditions are satisfied,
including, among others, that no default or event of default is in existence, that the we are in pro forma
compliance with the financial covenants described below and that our senior secured leverage ratio is less than
3.00 to 1 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness. As of April 2, 2016, we
had $15.5 million of standby and trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

**_Guarantees; Security_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect
U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other
subsidiaries. We and each of the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility (other than guarantors that
only guarantee the Euro Term Loan Facility) have granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility a
valid and perfected first priority (subject to certain customary exceptions) lien and security interest in the
following:

- the equity interests of substantially all of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries (other than U.S.
subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by foreign subsidiaries) and 65% of the voting securities of certain
first tier foreign subsidiaries; and

- substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of us and
each guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of such property and
assets.

Additionally, the Euro Term Loan Facility is also guaranteed by substantially all of MFB International Holdings’
existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries and its direct parent company, with certain customary or
agreed-upon exceptions for certain subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the equity interests of MFB
International Holdings, its direct subsidiaries and its direct parent company, 100% of the equity interests owned
by any subsidiary of MFB International Holdings that is domiciled in Luxembourg and substantially all present
and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of each Luxembourg domiciled
guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of such property and assets. In
connection with this offering, the Issuer and its general partner, Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg, will become
guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility and their shares and assets, including the Issuer’s receivable under
the Proceeds Loan, will be pledged to secure our obligations under the Euro Term Loan Facility.

**_Prepayments_**

The Term Loan A Facility, the Term Loan B Facility and the Euro Term Loan Facility require us and our
subsidiary, MFB International Holdings, as applicable, to prepay any outstanding term loans in connection with
(1) the incurrence of non-permitted indebtedness and (2) non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions
(including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds in any period of 12 consecutive
months, with customary reinvestment provisions. The Term Loan B Facility and the Euro Term Loan Facility
also require us and MFB International Holdings, as applicable, to prepay any outstanding term loans under the
Term Loan B Facility and the Euro Term Loan Facility in connection with excess cash flow, and the applicable
percentage of such excess cash flow that is subject to such prepayment will be based upon our leverage ratio
during the relevant fiscal period. All such prepayments will be made on a pro rata basis under each applicable
tranche of term loans that are subject to such prepayments.

86


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial
covenants. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a
maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization, as
computed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility), or leverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio covenant
requires that the ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters to its consolidated total interest
expense for such period shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter. The leverage ratio covenant
requires that the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more than 4.0
to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter; provided that following a permitted acquisition in which the consideration is at least
$200 million, such maximum leverage ratio covenant shall be increased to 4.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter
ending in the succeeding 12-month period following such permitted acquisition. The method of calculating all of
the components used in the covenants is included in the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

**_Fees_**

In addition, a commitment fee accrues on the unused portion of revolving loan commitments under the Senior
Secured Credit Facility at a per annum rate fluctuating between 25 and 35 basis points based on the applicable
commitment fee margin in effect from time to time. When the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured
Credit Facility) is greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, the commitment fee margin is 0.350%. When the
Leverage Ratio is less than 4.00 to 1.00 but greater than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee
margin is 0.300%. When the Leverage Ratio is less than 3.25 to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee margin is
0.250%.

**Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility**

We are also party to an accounts receivable securitization facility, which provides for up to $275 million in
funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables and is secured by
certain domestic trade receivables (the “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility”). Under the terms of the
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, certain
domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC (“Receivables LLC”), a wholly owned bankruptcy-remote
subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the borrowings, which are funded through conduits and
financial institutions that are not affiliated with us. The commitments of any conduits party to the Accounts
Receivable Securitization Facility are funded through the issuance of commercial paper in the short-term market
or through committed bank purchasers. The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are fully reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet, and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes, but
the assets of Receivables LLC will be used first to satisfy the creditors of Receivables LLC, not our creditors.
The borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remain outstanding throughout the term of
the agreement subject to us maintaining sufficient eligible receivables, by continuing to sell trade receivables to
Receivables LLC, unless an event of default occurs. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility is
scheduled to terminate on March 10, 2017 unless renewed.

Availability of funding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility depends primarily upon the
eligible outstanding receivables balance. The outstanding balance under the Accounts Receivable Securitization
Facility is reported on our consolidated balance sheet in the line “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility.”
In the case of any creditors party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility that are conduits, unless the
conduits fail to fund, the yield on the commercial paper, which is the conduits’ cost to issue the commercial
paper plus certain dealer fees, is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on our
consolidated statement of income included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. If the conduits fail to fund,
the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility would be funded through committed bank purchasers, and the
interest rate would be payable at our option at the rate announced from time to time by HSBC Bank USA, N.A.
as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) plus the

87


-----

applicable margin in effect from time to time. In the case of borrowings from any other creditors party to the
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility that are not conduits or their related committed bank purchasers, the
interest rate is payable at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) or, if this
rate is unavailable or otherwise does not accurately reflect the costs to these creditors related to the borrowings,
the prime rate. These amounts are also considered financing costs and are included in interest expense on our
consolidated statement of income. In addition, HBI Receivables LLC is required to make certain payments to a
conduit purchaser, a committed purchaser, or certain entities that provide funding to or are affiliated with them,
in the event that assets and liabilities of a conduit purchaser are consolidated for financial and/or regulatory
accounting purposes with certain other entities.

The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility contains customary events of default and requires us to maintain
the same interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio contained from time to time in the Senior Secured Credit
Facility, provided that any changes to such covenants will only be applicable for purposes of the Accounts
Receivable Securitization Facility if approved by the Managing Agents or their affiliates.

The total amount of receivables used as collateral for the credit facility was $369.7 million at April 2, 2016.

**Other International Debt**

In connection with the Hanes Europe Innerwear acquisition, we assumed debt (the “Other International Debt”),
totaling approximately $132.6 million as of the acquisition date. Concurrent with the closing, approximately
$107.7 million was repaid utilizing proceeds from the Euro Term Loan Facility. The long-term debt outstanding
as of April 2, 2016 consists of mortgage loans and term loans collateralized by fixed assets. These loans have
maturity dates ranging from April 2016 to May 2018, and bear interest primarily based on EURIBOR rates
ranging from 1.5% to 6.25% as of April 2, 2016.

**4.625% Senior Notes due 2024**

On May 6, 2016, we completed the sale of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due
2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The 4.625% Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2024. Interest on the 2024 Notes will
accrue from May 6, 2016 and the first interest payment date will be November 15, 2016.

Prior to February 15, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2024 Notes), we may redeem all or a
portion of the 2024 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition, on or after February 15,
2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2024 Notes), we may redeem all or a portion of the 2024
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

The 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantees
our Senior Secured Credit Facility and, in the future, by domestic subsidiaries that guarantee certain material debt
facilities of Hanesbrands Inc. or guarantors of the 2024 Notes or certain material debt securities issued by
Hanesbrands Inc. or guarantors of the 2024 Notes.

We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes (as defined below)
to pay the redemption price associated with our outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.375%
Senior Notes due 2020 that have been called for redemption on June 2, 2016 in accordance with their terms. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Refinancing Transactions.”

**4.875% Senior Notes due 2026**

On May 6, 2016, we completed the sale of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due
2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The 2026 Notes will mature on May 15, 2026. Interest on the 2026 Notes will accrue
from May 6, 2016 and the first interest payment date will be November 15, 2016.

88


-----

Prior to February 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2026 Notes), we may redeem all or a
portion of the 2026 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition, on or after February 15,
2026 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2026 Notes), we may redeem all or a portion of the 2026
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

The 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantees
our Senior Secured Credit Facility and, in the future, by domestic subsidiaries that guarantee certain material debt
facilities of Hanesbrands Inc. or guarantors of the 2026 Notes or certain material debt securities issued by
Hanesbrands Inc. or guarantors of the 2026 Notes.

We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes to pay the
redemption price associated with our outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior
Notes due 2020 that have been called for redemption on June 2, 2016 in accordance with their terms. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Refinancing Transactions.”

The definitions of certain capitalized terms used in the following summary are set forth below under “—Certain

will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Parent and certain Subsidiaries of the Parent.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. We urge
you to read the Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as holders of the Notes. You may
request copies of the Indenture at our address set forth under the heading “Where You Can Find More
Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

    - be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer;

    - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any non-guarantor Subsidiary;

    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and

    - be guaranteed by each Guarantor on a senior unsecured basis, subject to contractual limitations that
reflect limitations under applicable law. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will be, subject to contractual limitations that reflect limitations under applicable law, guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior basis by each Guarantor and each existing and future Subsidiary of the Parent
that is required to become a Guarantor in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Future Guarantors.” As of the Issue Date, the Guarantors will include the Parent and the following of its
Subsidiaries: Maidenform (Asia) Limited, Choloma, Inc., Hanesbrands Dos Rios Textiles, Inc., Hanesbrands

Hanesbrands Apparel (Hong Kong) Limited, Hanesbrands Corporate Services (Hong Kong) Limited,
Maidenform Brands International Limited, Hanes Commercial Europe S.à r.l., Hanes Global Holdings
Luxembourg S.à r.l., Hanes Global Supply Chain Europe S.à r.l., Hanes Holdings Lux S.à r.l., Hanes IP Europe
S.à r.l., MFB International Holdings S.à r.l., Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg S.à r.l. and Hanes Netherlands
Holdings B.V.

Each Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor;

- rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such
Guarantor;

- rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any non-guarantor Subsidiary.

Not all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to their parent entity.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to
reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Corporate
benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the guarantees may adversely affect the validity and
enforceability of the guarantees” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

In addition, on the Issue Date, Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal, a Spanish limited liability
company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l., an Italian limited liability
company (societa` a responsabilita` limitata), and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd, an Australian
proprietary limited company, will not be Guarantors. Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal is currently a
guarantor under our Euro Term Loan Facility and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l. and Hanesbrands
Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd to become guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility on or prior to the
date of the consummation of the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, respectively. We have
agreed that such entities will become Guarantors no later than 30 days after the Issue Date. See “—Certain
Covenants—Future Guarantors.”

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue the Notes initially with a maximum aggregate principal amount of €450 million. The Issuer
will issue the Notes in denominations of €100,000 and any greater integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Notes will mature on, 2024. The Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes under the
Indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount having identical terms and conditions as the Notes, other
than the date of issuance and, under certain circumstances, the first interest payment date and the date from
which interest thereon will begin to accrue (any such additional notes, the “Additional Notes”); provided that if
any such Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes issued in this offering for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, such Additional Notes will have one or more separate CUSIP numbers and/or ISINs from the Notes
issued in this offering. The Notes and any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to the Notes include any
Additional Notes actually issued.

91


-----

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in
arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2016. The Issuer will make each interest
payment to the holders of record of the Notes on the immediately preceding and .

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Listing**

Application will be made to initially list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. The Issuer may choose to apply to list the notes on
another recognized stock exchange or may, at any time, upon the good faith determination of the Parent’s senior
management that the ongoing reporting requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange are overly burdensome
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, more burdensome than the Parent’s reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act) to the Issuer, determine that it will not maintain such listing and may instead seek to obtain a
listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
paragraph shall oblige the Issuer to list the Notes, and there can be no assurance that an application to list the
Notes will be approved. Settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the global notes representing the Notes will be payable at the
specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes
represented by one or more global note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear and
Clearstream will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the holder
or holders thereof. For a description of the provisions of Euroclear and Clearstream governing methods of
receiving payment on global notes, see “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance.”

Principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any certificated securities will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the City of London and Luxembourg, in each case, maintained
for such purposes. In addition, interest on any certificated securities may be paid by check mailed to the person
entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar
for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes, including one Paying
Agent in the City of London. The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member state of the
European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive
2003/48/EC, or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of
November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or
introduced in order to conform to, any such directive. Elavon Financial Services Limited will initially act as
Paying Agent for the Notes.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services Limited and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial
Services Limited, UK Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes
on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of
inconsistency between the register of Senior kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered
office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

92


-----

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
holders of such Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper
having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and
in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange (www.bourse.lu). The Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect
of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar, the Trustee and any
Paying Agent may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and the Issuer may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the
Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is
not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes, but the Issuer may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the
transfer or exchange.

The holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except as described below under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Issuer
will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option.

Prior to, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the Issuer will be entitled, at
its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the
redemption date for the Notes. Notice of such redemption must be mailed by first-class mail (or delivered by
electronic transmission in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) to each
holder’s registered address, not less than ten nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, and any such
redemption will otherwise be given in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Selection and Notice of
Redemption.”

In addition, on or after, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the Issuer may
redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including the redemption date the Notes, and any such notice of
redemption will otherwise be given in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Selection and Notice of
Redemption.”

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment
date, then any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of Notes subject to redemption will be paid on the
redemption date to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business, on such record date,
and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption
and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

93


-----

“Applicable Premium” means with respect to a Note at any redemption date, as provided by the Issuer, the excess
of (1) the present value at such redemption date of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
due on the Note (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date),
computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate, over (2) the principal amount of the Note on such
redemption date.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Premium will not be the obligation or responsibility of
the Trustee or Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Federal Republic
of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled and published in the
most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than
five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available,
any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer in good faith)) most nearly equal to the
period from the redemption date to, 2024; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption
date to the applicable date set forth above is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the
Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by
linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from
such redemption date to the applicable date set forth above is less than one year, the weekly average yield on
actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year
shall be used.

**Selection and Notice of Redemption**

Notice of any redemption of the Notes in connection with a transaction or an event (including a Change of
Control Triggering Event) may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion or the occurrence
thereof and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related transaction or event.

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as applicable, will select
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee or the Registrar, as applicable, by the Issuer, and in compliance
with the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes
no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear and
Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000
in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. The Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar shall
not be liable for any selection of Notes made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading
on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the
holders of the Notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules be posted on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and in addition to such release, not less than ten
nor more than 60 days’ prior to the redemption date, if the Notes are in certificated form, the Issuer will mail, or
at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption
may also be posted on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the
manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be
given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account
holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

94


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a certificated Note, a new Note in principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note
to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or a successor entity may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than ten nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and
which will become due on the redemption date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, a
successor entity or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) reasonably determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below in “—Withholding Taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

such Payor is or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to such
Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable). In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction
that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as of the Issue Date, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or
after the Issue Date. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a
jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the Issue Date, such Change in Tax Law must
become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notice of
redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice of Redemption.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the relevant Payor would be obliged to make
such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the
time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the
publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer or a successor entity will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect
such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to
redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect
that the relevant Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in
Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the holders.

95


-----

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by a Payor with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or government charges of whatever nature (including any penalties, interest and other additions
relating thereto) (collectively, “Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Luxembourg or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee, as applicable, is made
by the relevant Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the relevant Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident
for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor with respect to any Note or
Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, if any, the relevant
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the holders, the Trustee or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or
deduction from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment
in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note or
Guarantee or the receipt of any payment or enforcement of rights in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of
the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the holder, after reasonable notice,
to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence
or identity of the holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy
any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption
from all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes that would not have been so withheld or deducted if the Note had been presented for
payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant
payment was first made available the holder of the Note (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such Note been presented for payment on the last day of
such 30-day period);

96


-----

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is permitted
or required for payment) by or on behalf of a holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to
avoid such tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another
Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(7) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (the “Code”) (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
(or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements
thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any similar law or regulation implementing an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States related thereto; or

(8) any combination of the above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a fiduciary or
a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such
Notes directly.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on a Payor’s obligation to pay Additional Amounts set forth in
clause (2) above will not apply if compliance with any certification, information, documentation, evidentiary or
other reporting requirement described in such clause (2) would be materially more onerous, in form, in procedure
or in the substance of information disclosed, to a holder or beneficial owner of a Note than comparable
information or other reporting requirements imposed under U.S. tax law, regulations and administrative practice
(such as IRS Forms W-8 and W-9).

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified
copies to the Trustee and the Paying Agents. Such copies shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agents.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the
date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof, without further inquiry, that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture or this offering memorandum there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

97


-----

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, any other excise
taxes or any other property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including, in each case, any penalties, interest and
other liabilities relating thereto) that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration,
enforcement or making of payments in respect of the Notes, the Indenture or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto, excluding any such taxes imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Jurisdiction, except
those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes after the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. The Issuer agrees to
indemnify the holders for any such taxes paid by such holders. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will
survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any
jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax
purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**No Sinking Fund; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—Change of
Control Triggering Event.” The Issuer may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a
redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance
with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.

**Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the Guarantors. As of the Issue Date, the
Guarantors will be the entities set forth above under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes and the
Guarantees—The Guarantees.” Subject to certain limitations under applicable law, existing and future
Subsidiaries of the Parent will be required to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors.”

In addition, on the Issue Date, Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal, a Spanish limited liability
company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l., an Italian limited liability
company (societa` a responsabilita` limitata), and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd, an Australian
proprietary limited company, will not be Guarantors. Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal is currently a
guarantor under our Euro Term Loan Facility and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l. and Hanesbrands
Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd to become guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility on or prior to the
date of the consummation of the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, respectively. We have
agreed that such entities will become Guarantors no later than 30 days after the Issue Date. See “—Certain
Covenants—Future Guarantors.”

The Indenture will limit the obligation to grant guarantees in favor of obligations under the Notes and will
include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by
general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. The obligations of the Guarantors will be
contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect these limitations and other legal restrictions
applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Notes—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the guarantees
may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the guarantees” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations
and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.

Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed
obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time
of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

98


-----

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(A) (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent
and as permitted by the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
a Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent and as permitted by the
Indenture;

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer guarantees
any (i) Debt Facility with aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million or more (including, without
limitation, the Senior Secured Credit Facility) or (ii) Material Capital Markets Debt of the Parent;

(4) upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes, as provided under “—Defeasance” or
the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;” or

(6) in the case of the Parent, upon the circumstances described in (4) and (5), and if the Issuer ceases for
any reason to be a Subsidiary of the Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the
Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any Debt Facility or Material Capital Markets Debt of
the Issuer terminate upon the Issuer ceasing to be a Subsidiary of the Parent; and

(B) upon such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction or release have
been complied with.

In the case of clause (A)(3), subject to the covenant set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,”
in the event that any released Subsidiary Guarantor thereafter borrows money or guarantees indebtedness under
any Debt Facility with aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million or more or Material Capital Markets Debt of
the Parent, such former Subsidiary Guarantor will again provide a Guarantee. See “—Certain Covenants—Future
Guarantors.”

The Trustee shall take all necessary actions to effectuate any release of a Guarantor in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth
above shall be effected by Trustee without the consent of the holders of the Notes or any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee. At the Issuer’s written request and expense, the Trustee will promptly execute and
deliver an instrument prepared by the Issuer evidencing such release.

**Ranking**

The indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank
equally in right of payment with all other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor, as the case may be.

As of April 2, 2016, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the estimated net proceeds from this
offering as set forth in “Use of Proceeds,” and the Refinancing Transactions:

(1) the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had approximately $3.85 billion of total indebtedness
(including the Notes);

99


-----

(2) the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had commitments available to be borrowed under the
Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $888.6 million (which commitments may be borrowed to,
among other things, finance the acquisitions of Champion Europe and/or Pacific Brands); and

(3) the non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent would have had less than $900 million of total liabilities,
including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.

The Notes and the Guarantees are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be.
Secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including indebtedness
incurred under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guarantees to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or other obligations.

The Indenture contains no limitations on the amount of additional indebtedness that the Issuer and the Guarantors
may incur and therefore the amount of such indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to the limitations set
forth in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” such indebtedness may be
secured indebtedness. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by the Parent or
its Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered indebtedness under the Indenture.

A substantial portion of our operations is conducted through our Subsidiaries. Guarantees may be released under
certain circumstances. In addition, our future Subsidiaries will only be required to guarantee the Notes under
the circumstances described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors.” Claims of creditors
(including trade creditors) of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries and joint ventures, and claims of preferred
stockholders of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries and joint ventures, generally will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes and the Guarantees. Accordingly, the Notes will be
effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders, if any, of such nonguarantor Subsidiaries and joint ventures.

For the 12 months ended April 2, 2016, we estimate that these non-guarantor Subsidiaries accounted for less than
15% of our consolidated sales, excluding intercompany transactions. As of April 2, 2016, our non-guarantor
Subsidiaries represented less than 40% of our consolidated total assets and had less than $900 million of total
liabilities, including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.

**Change of Control Triggering Event**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each noteholder shall have the right to require that the Issuer
make an offer to purchase such noteholder’s Notes (equal to €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof in the case of Notes that have denominations larger than €100,000) at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the date of purchase.

If the Change of Control purchase date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest to the Change of Control purchase date will be paid on the Change
of Control purchase date to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record
date.

100


-----

Within 30 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuer has
exercised its option to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will mail (or
deliver by electronic transmission in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) a
notice to each holder of a Note with a copy to the Trustee (the “Change of Control Offer”) stating:

(1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and that such noteholder has the right to
require us to purchase such noteholder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the date of purchase;

(2) the circumstances that constitute or may constitute such Change of Control Triggering Event;

(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is sent); and

(4) the instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a
noteholder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased.

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will
publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of
Control payment date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official_
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering
Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or if the Issuer has
exercised its option to redeem all of the Notes pursuant to the provisions described under “—Optional
Redemption.”

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes as a result of a Change of
Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of the covenant described hereunder, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the covenant described hereunder by
virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Parent and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between us and the initial
purchasers. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is
possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the
future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would
not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to
incur additional secured indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however,
the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction.

Holders may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a
significant change in the composition of our Board of Directors, including in connection with a proxy contest.

101


-----

The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect
to the Parent would constitute a default thereunder. Future indebtedness that we may incur may contain
prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require the purchase
of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us
to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does
not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on us. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of
Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of
Control Triggering Event.”

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of such Change of Control Offer.

The phrase “all or substantially all,” as used with respect to the assets of the Parent in the definition of “Change
of Control,” is subject to interpretation under applicable law, and its applicability in a given instance would
depend upon the facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining
whether a sale or transfer of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Parent has occurred in a particular instance,
in which case a holder of Notes’ ability to obtain the benefit of these provisions could be unclear.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

For purposes of this discussion of a repurchase of the Notes following a Change of Control Triggering Event:

A “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act or
any successor provision), is or becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is used in Rules 13d-3 and
13d-5 under the Exchange Act or any successor provision), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of
the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Parent;

(2) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Parent;

(3) the merger or consolidation of the Parent with or into another Person or the merger of another Person
with or into the Parent or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Parent (determined on a
consolidated basis) to another Person, other than a transaction following which in the case of a merger
or consolidation transaction, holders of securities that represented 100% of the Voting Stock of the
Parent immediately prior to such transaction (or other securities into which such securities are
converted as part of such merger or consolidation transaction) own, directly or indirectly, at least a
majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or
consolidation transaction immediately after such transaction; or

(4) the Parent ceases to own, directly or indirectly, 100% of all equity interests in the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (a) the Parent
becomes a direct Subsidiary of a holding company, (b) such holding company owns no assets other than the
Capital Stock of the Parent and (c) upon completion of such transaction, the ultimate beneficial ownership of the
Parent has not been modified by such transaction.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance_**

(a) The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may not consolidate with or merge into any other entity or
convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any entity, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the successor entity, or the successor or transferee entity, if other than the Issuer, is a
Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of
Columbia, Canada, any province of Canada, Norway, Switzerland or any member state of the
European Union (except if the Issuer determines in good faith that such requirement is not in the
best interests of the Parent and its Subsidiaries or that complying with such requirement would not
be advisable for tax planning purposes or to improve tax efficiencies) and expressly assumes by a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any premium on and any interest on
all the outstanding Notes and the performance of every covenant and obligation in the Indenture to
be performed or observed by the Issuer;

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture,
and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, has
happened and is continuing; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each in
the form required by the Indenture and stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction,
such supplemental indenture comply with the foregoing provisions relating to such transaction,
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer or successor entity, as
applicable, subject to customary exceptions.

In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer (but not lease), the successor entity
will succeed to and be substituted for the Issuer as obligor on the Notes with the same effect as if it had
been named in the Indenture as the Issuer.

(b) The Indenture will provide that no Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into any other entity,
unless:

(1) a Guarantor is the successor entity or the successor or transferee entity, if not a Guarantor prior to
such consolidation or merger, expressly assumes, by a supplemental indenture, all the obligations
of such Guarantor under its Guarantee;

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture,
and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, has
happened and is continuing; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each in
the form required by the Indenture and stating that such consolidation or merger and, if a
supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
indenture comply with the foregoing provisions relating to such transaction and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor or successor entity, as applicable, subject to
customary exceptions.

Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, this “—Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance” covenant will
not apply to a merger, transfer or conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Issuer and the
Guarantors.

103


-----

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Parent to, create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee
any indebtedness for money borrowed evidenced by loans, bonds, notes, debentures, letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, hedging obligations or instruments similar to the foregoing, in each case to the extent such
indebtedness would appear as a liability on the balance sheet of such Person in accordance with GAAP (“Debt”)
secured by a Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon (a) any Property of the Parent or such Subsidiary or (b) any
shares of Capital Stock or Debt issued by any Subsidiary of the Parent and owned by the Parent or any
Subsidiary of the Parent, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, without effectively providing
concurrently that the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture are secured equally and ratably with or, at the
option of the Parent, prior to such Debt so long as such Debt shall be so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by
its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Lien relating to such Debt that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes.

The foregoing restriction shall not apply to, and there shall be excluded from Debt (or any guarantee thereof) in
any computation under such restriction, Debt (or any guarantee thereof) secured by:

(1) Liens on any property existing at the time of the acquisition thereof;

(2) Liens on property of a Person existing at the time such Person is merged into or consolidated with the
Parent or a Subsidiary of the Parent or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties
of such Person (or a division thereof) as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Parent or a
Subsidiary of the Parent; provided that any such Lien does not extend to any property owned by the
Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, sale, lease or
disposition;

(3) Liens on property of a Person existing at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary of the Parent;

(4) Liens in favor of the Parent or a Subsidiary of the Parent;

(5) Liens to secure all or part of the cost of acquisition, construction, development or improvement of the
underlying property, or to secure Debt incurred to provide funds for any such purpose; provided that
the commitment of the creditor to extend the credit secured by any such Lien shall have been obtained
no later than 270 days after the later of (a) the completion of the acquisition, construction, development
or improvement of such property or (b) the placing in operation of such property; provided, further,
that such Liens do not extend to any property other than such property subject to acquisition,
construction, development or improvement;

(6) Liens in favor of the United States of America, any State thereof, any institution of the European Union
or any foreign government, or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision
thereof, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments;

(7) Liens existing on the Issue Date or any extension, renewal, replacement or refunding or series of
related extensions, renewals, replacements or refundings of any Debt (or any guarantee thereof)
(including the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility) secured by a Lien existing
on the Issue Date or referred to in clauses (1)-(3) or (5); provided that any such extension, renewal,
replacement or refunding or series of related extensions, renewals, replacements or refundings of such
Debt (or any guarantee thereof) shall be created within 270 days of repaying the Debt (or any guarantee
thereof) secured by the Lien referred to in clauses (1)-(3) or (5) and the principal amount of the Debt
(or any guarantee thereof) secured thereby and not otherwise authorized by clauses (1)-(3) or (5) shall
not exceed the principal amount of Debt (or any guarantee thereof), plus any premium or fee payable in
connection with any such extension, renewal, replacement or refunding, so secured at the time of such
extension, renewal, replacement or refunding or series of related extensions, renewals, replacements or
refundings;

104


-----

(8) Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $100.0
million;

(9) Liens in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees; and

(10) Liens securing hedging obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business.

In addition, notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the Parent and any Subsidiaries of the Parent may
create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by Liens without equally and ratably securing the Notes
then outstanding if, at the time of such creation, incurrence, issuance, assumption or guarantee, after giving effect
thereto and to the retirement of any Debt which is concurrently being retired,

(A) the aggregate amount of all such Debt secured by Liens which would otherwise be subject to such
restrictions (other than any Debt (or any guarantee thereof) secured by Liens permitted as described in
clauses (1)-(10) of the immediately preceding paragraph) plus

(B) all Attributable Debt of the Parent and the Subsidiaries of the Parent in respect of Sale/Leaseback
Transactions with respect to Properties (with the exception of such transactions that are permitted
under clauses (1)-(4) of the first sentence of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions” below)

would not exceed the greater of (x) $3,000.0 million and (y) the amount that would cause the Consolidated
Secured Net Debt Ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00.

**_Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Parent to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback
Transaction with respect to any Property unless:

(1) the Sale/Leaseback Transaction is solely with the Parent or another Subsidiary of the Parent;

(2) the lease is for a period not in excess of 36 months (or which may be terminated by the Parent or such
Subsidiary), including renewals;

(3) the Parent or such Subsidiary would (at the time of entering into such arrangement) be entitled as
described in clauses (1)-(10) of the second paragraph under the heading “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens,” without equally and ratably securing the Notes then outstanding under the
Indenture, to create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a Lien on such Property in the
amount of the Attributable Debt arising from such Sale/Leaseback Transaction;

(4) the Parent or such Subsidiary, within 360 days after the sale of such Property in connection with such
Sale/Leaseback Transaction is completed, applies an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale of
such Property to (a) the retirement of Notes, other Funded Debt of the Parent ranking on a parity with
the Notes (or the Guarantees of the Notes) or Funded Debt of a Subsidiary of the Parent, (b) the
purchase of Property; or (c) a combination thereof; or

(5) (a) the Attributable Debt of the Parent and Subsidiaries of the Parent in respect of such Sale/Leaseback
Transaction and all other Attributable Debt of the Parent and Subsidiaries of the Parent in respect of
Sale/Leaseback Transactions entered into after the Issue Date then outstanding (other than any such
Sale/Leaseback Transaction as would be permitted as described in clauses (1)-(4) of this sentence), plus

(b) the aggregate principal amount of Debt secured by Liens on Properties then outstanding (not
including any such Debt secured by Liens described in clauses (1)-(10) of the second paragraph under
the heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”) that are not equally and ratably secured with
the outstanding Notes (or secured on a basis junior to the outstanding Notes),

would not exceed the greater of (x) $3,000.0 million and (y) the amount that would cause the
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00.

105


-----

**_Future Guarantors_**

After the Issue Date, the Parent will cause each Subsidiary of the Parent that guarantees (i) any Debt Facility of
the Issuer, the Parent or any other Guarantor with an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million or more or
(ii) any Material Capital Markets Debt issued by the Issuer, the Parent or any other Guarantor to, within 45 days
of the incurrence of such guarantee, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
pursuant to which such Subsidiary of the Parent will guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Indenture; provided that such Subsidiary shall not be obliged to become a
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the granting of such Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (i) any
breach or violation of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference or thin capitalization rules, retention of title to claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; or (ii) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
shareholders of such Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (iii) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) to the extent such cost, expense, liability or obligation are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the
holders of the Notes with respect to the receipt of the guarantee (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

To the extent any Subsidiary of the Parent is required to provide a Guarantee, such Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

In addition, on the Issue Date, Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal, a Spanish limited liability
company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l., an Italian limited liability
company (societa` a responsabilita` limitata), and Hanesbrands Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd, an Australian
proprietary limited company, will not be Guarantors. Maidenform Brands Spain, S.R.L Unipersonal is currently a
guarantor under our Euro Term Loan Facility and we expect HBI Italy Acquisition Co. S.r.l. and Hanesbrands
Australia Acquisition Co. Pty Ltd to become guarantors under our Euro Term Loan Facility upon the
consummation of the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, respectively. We have agreed that
such entities will become Guarantors no later than 30 days after the Issue Date.

**_Provision of Financial Information_**

Whether or not required by the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will furnish to the holders
of such Notes, or file electronically with the SEC through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval System (or any successor system) (“EDGAR”), within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
regulations:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing by the
Parent with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Parent were required to file such Forms, including
a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and, with
respect to the annual information only, a report on the annual financial statements by the Parent’s
certified independent accountants; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed by the Parent with the SEC on Form 8-K if the
Parent were required to file such reports,

_provided that such reports referenced in clauses (1) and (2) above shall not be required to contain the separate_
financial information for any Guarantor or non-consolidated entity that would be required by Rule 3-09,
Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.

The Parent will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of
this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and

106


-----

admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the
offices of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such
reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

In addition, whether or not required by the SEC, the Parent will file a copy of all of the information and reports
referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and regulations (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information
available to prospective investors. In addition, the Parent has agreed that, for so long as any Notes remain
outstanding, it will furnish to the holders of such Notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Trustee shall have no responsibility to ensure that such filing has occurred. Delivery of reports, information
and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and its receipt of such reports shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein,
including our compliance with any of the covenants under the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates without further enquiry). The Parent will be deemed to have
furnished such reports referred to in this section to the Trustee and the noteholders if the Parent has filed such
reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system and such reports are publicly available.

**Defaults**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) a default in the payment of interest on the Notes when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon redemption,
upon required purchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with its obligations under “—Certain Covenants—
Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance;”

(4) the failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, to comply for 45 days after notice with
any of its obligations in the covenants described above under “Change of Control Triggering Event”
(other than a failure to purchase Notes) or under “—Certain Covenants” under “—Limitation on
Liens,” “—Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions” or “—Future Guarantors;”

(5) the failure by the Parent to comply for 120 days after notice with any of its obligations in the covenant
described above under “—Certain Covenants—Provision of Financial Information;”

(6) the failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements
contained in the Indenture;

(7) Debt of the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken
together (as of the date of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is not paid within any applicable grace period
after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the total amount of
such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds $150.0 million;

(8) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the date of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary);

(9) any final judgment or decree for the payment of money (other than judgments which are covered by
enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers) in excess of $150.0 million is entered against
the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as

107


-----

of the date of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), remains outstanding for a period of 60 consecutive days
following such judgment becoming final and is not discharged, waived or stayed within 30 days after
notice; or

(10) a Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Guarantee) or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee.

However, a Default under clauses (4), (5), (6) and (9) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer and the Parent (with a copy to
the Trustee if given by the holders of Notes) of the Default and the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, does
not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. In the event of any Event of Default
specified under clause (7), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment
default, other than as a result of acceleration of Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically
and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of Notes, if within 60 days after such Event of Default arose:
(a) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to
such Event of Default or (b) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Parent (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by
the holders) may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, and premium, if any, on all the
outstanding Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, such principal, interest and premium, if any,
shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization of the Parent and/or the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest (and
premium, if any) on all the outstanding Notes of will ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of such Notes. Under certain
circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the
Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense and then only to the extent required by the terms of the Indenture. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or such Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in
writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding)
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of
security and/or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written
direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the

108


-----

rights of any other holder of a Note (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to
ascertain whether or not any such directions are unduly prejudicial to such holders) or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability.

If a Default occurs, is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail (or deliver by
electronic transmission in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) to each
holder of Notes notice of the Default within 90 days after the Trustee has knowledge of such Default. Except in
the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, interest or premium on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the holders. In addition, the Issuer
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would
constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action we are taking or propose to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange for the Notes) and any past default or compliance with any provisions may also be waived with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. However, without the
consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Notes), an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Note held by a non-consenting holder among other things:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) change the optional redemption dates or prices or calculations from those described under “—Optional
Redemption” or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons;”

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) amend the right of any holder of the Notes to bring suit for the payment of principal, premium, if any,
and interest (including Additional Amounts) on its Notes, on or after the respective due dates expressed
or provided for in such Notes;

(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of
such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) make any change in the ranking or priority of any Note or Guarantee that would adversely affect the
noteholders; or

(9) release any Guarantor from its Guarantee except as provided for in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors and
Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, as determined in good faith by us;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Indenture;

109


-----

(3) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) to (i) add guarantees with respect to the Notes, including any Guarantees, or (ii) secure such Notes, in
each case pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture;

(5) to add to the covenants of the Parent or any Subsidiary for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Parent or any Subsidiary;

(6) to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Parent;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or Notes to any provision of this “Description of
notes,” as determined in good faith by the Parent;

(8) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture to the extent otherwise so permitted
under the terms of the Indenture;

(9) to release a Guarantor from its Guarantee when permitted by the terms of the Indenture;

(10) to provide for successor trustees or to add to or change any provisions to the extent necessary to
appoint a separate trustee for the Notes; or

(11) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of such Notes, or, if incurred in compliance with the Indenture, Additional Notes;
_provided, however, that (A) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in such_
Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (B) such
amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes, as
determined in good faith by us.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clause (4)(i) above, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture to be duly authorized and executed
by the Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need
only be duly authorized and executed by Issuer and the Trustee.

The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

The Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
in relation to any amendment or supplement.

After an amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to mail (or deliver by
electronic transmission in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) to holders of
the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all holders of
the Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

The Issuer will, for so long as the Notes are admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market, to the extent required
by its rules, inform the Euro MTF Market of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and
provide, if necessary, a supplement to this offering memorandum setting forth reasonable details in connection
with any such amendments, supplements or waivers.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will
inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and
publish a notice of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers on the website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

The Notes will be issued in registered form and will be transferable only upon the surrender of the Notes being
transferred for registration of transfer. The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax,
assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection with certain transfers and exchanges.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations and the obligations of the
Guarantors discharged with respect to the Indenture and the outstanding Notes and the Guarantees issued under
the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders to receive payments in respect of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes when such payments are due, solely out of the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
Note payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the legal defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises the legal defeasance option, the Guarantees in effect at such time will be automatically
released.

The Issuer at any time may be released from its obligations described under “—Change of Control Triggering
Event” and under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than under “—Consolidation,
Merger, Sale or Conveyance”) (“covenant defeasance”).

If the Issuer exercises the covenant defeasance option, the Guarantees in effect at such time will be automatically
released.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance
option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, an Event
of Default specified in clause (4), clause (5), clause (7), clause (8) (solely with respect to Significant
Subsidiaries), clause (9) or clause (10) under “—Events of Default” above, in each case, shall not constitute an
Event of Default.

In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of Notes,
cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in
amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, a nationally recognized investment bank or a nationally recognized appraisal or valuation
firm delivered to the Trustee, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay the
principal, premium, if any, and interest due on the outstanding Notes of on the Stated Maturity or on
the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are
being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of legal defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the Issuer has received from, or
there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the Issue Date,

111


-----

there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that,
and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel will confirm that the beneficial owners of the Notes will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of covenant defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;

(4) in the case of legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the
beneficial owners of the Notes will be subject to Luxembourg income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such legal defeasance or covenant
defeasance, as the case may be, had not occurred and (b) payments from the defeasance trust will be
free and exempt from any and all withholding and other income taxes of whatever nature imposed or
levied by or on behalf of Luxembourg or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having power to tax;

(5) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit or will occur
as a result of such deposit (other than a Default or an Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Debt and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) and the deposit will not result in
a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Senior Secured Credit Facility or any other
material agreement or material debt instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound;

(6) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the legal defeasance or the covenant defeasance, as the case may be,
have been complied with; and

(7) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged, and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when
either:

(1) all such Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except, in the case of certificated notes, lost,
stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and
payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at
the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Trustee, as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of such
Notes, cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of
interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes not theretofore delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, provided that, with respect to any redemption that requires the

112


-----

payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is so deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit on the date of
redemption only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption;

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit or will
occur as a result of such deposit (other than a Default or an Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit
relating to other Debt and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(c) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer under the
Indenture; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of such Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions
precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is the Trustee under the Indenture.

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to
obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made, and notices
given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or any Note, where the Indenture or any Note provides for
notice of any event (including any notice of redemption) to any holder of an interest in a Global Note (whether
by mail or otherwise), such notice shall be sufficiently given if given to Euroclear or Clearstream or any other
applicable depositary for such Note (or its designee) according to the applicable procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream or such depositary.

In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the EuroMTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will make available all notices to the public in written form at
places indicated by announcements to be published in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, www.bourse.lu, or by other means considered equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In
addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes will be
delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to holders of book-entry interests.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the Issuer
or any Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than
the Issuer in respect of the Notes and each Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee) under the Notes, the Guarantees

113


-----

or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
securities law.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under
or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or any Guarantor or otherwise by any holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor will only constitute a
discharge of such Issuer or Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able
to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery
(or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them on a joint and several basis against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient
or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the holder of a Note
or the Trustee to certify in a satisfactory manner (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred
in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will
apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a noneuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such noneuro amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the assets of the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any non-U.S. Guarantor, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, Additional Amounts and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States. See
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the Notes and the
Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and
State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York. In respect of the Notes, the provisions of articles 86 to 94-8 (inclusive) of the
Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, shall be expressly excluded.

_provided further, however, that Consolidated Net Income for any period shall be determined after excluding the_
effects of adjustments (including the effects of such adjustments pushed down to the Parent and its Subsidiaries)
in any line item in the Parent’s consolidated financial statements in such period pursuant to GAAP resulting from
the application of purchase accounting in relation to any completed acquisition.

“Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (1)(a) the aggregate
amount of Funded Debt of the Parent and its Subsidiaries then outstanding that is secured by Liens as of such
date of determination, less (b) cash and cash equivalents of the Parent and its Subsidiaries to (2) EBITDA for the
most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements of the Parent are available, in
each case with pro forma and other adjustments to each of Funded Debt and EBITDA to reflect any incurrences
or repayments of Funded Debt (which pro forma and other adjustments will be determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent and shall not be required to be made in accordance with
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) and any acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets since the

committed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility or any Debt Facility that may be incurred by the Parent
or its Subsidiaries and which, upon incurrence, will be secured by a Lien, shall be deemed to be outstanding at all
times and subsequent borrowings, reborrowings, renewals, replacements and extensions of such revolving credit
indebtedness, up to such maximum committed amount, shall not be deemed additional incurrences of Funded
Debt requiring calculations under this definition (but subsequent incremental borrowings in connection with
increases in such maximum committed amount shall require calculations under this definition or shall otherwise
comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”).

“Debt Facilities” means one or more debt facilities (including, without limitation, the Senior Secured Credit

becoming an Event of Default.

no longer outstanding; provided, however, that if such Capital Stock is issued to any employee or to any plan for
the benefit of employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries or by any such plan to such employees, such Capital
Stock shall not constitute Disqualified Stock solely because it may be required to be repurchased by the Parent or
its Subsidiaries in order to satisfy obligations as a result of such employee’s death or disability; provided further,
_however, that any Capital Stock that would not constitute Disqualified Stock but for provisions thereof giving_
holders thereof the right to require such Person to purchase or redeem such Capital Stock upon the occurrence of
a “change of control” occurring on or prior to 91 days after the Stated Maturity of such Notes shall not constitute
Disqualified Stock if:

(1) the “change of control” provisions applicable to such Capital Stock are not more favorable to the holders
of such Capital Stock than the terms applicable to such Notes and described under “—Change of Control
Triggering Event;” and

(2) any such requirement only becomes operative after compliance with such terms applicable to such

shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a
Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event hereunder) if the Rating

circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or

whether the rating of the Notes has decreased by one or more gradations, gradations within Rating Categories,
namely + or - for S&P, and 1, 2, and 3 for Moody’s, will be taken into account; for example, in the case of S&P,

**Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance**

The notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (each, a “QIB”) in reliance on
Rule 144A will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). The notes sold to persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will initially be represented by one or more temporary global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Notes”). Temporary
Regulation S Global Notes will be exchangeable for permanent global notes (the “Permanent Regulation S
Global Notes” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”)
after the expiration of the Restricted Period (as described below). The Rule 144A Global Notes and the
Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global Notes.” The Global Notes will be deposited
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this
offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted
Period”), beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes may not be transferred to beneficial
interests in another Global Notes, unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global
Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold
interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to won, transfer, or
pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will
not be considered the owners or “holders” of the notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective
nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture that will
govern the notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights f holders under the indenture
that will govern the notes.

None of the Issuer, the guarantors, the registrar, the transfer agent, the trustee or any of their respective agents
will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will
make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law.
If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of
Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts

125


-----

received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding
will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Notes or Book-Entry Interests, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer, the trustee, the paying agents, registrars
and transfer agents (collectively, the “Agents”) will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g.,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the trustee, the Agents or any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interests or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account to, a Book-Entry Interests, or Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in such notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in euros.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of
one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or
the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
indenture that will govern the notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes under the indenture that will govern the notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”) and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in jurisdictions that
require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such notes, such holder of notes must transfer its interests in
the Global Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture governing the notes.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer
Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
indenture that will govern the notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

126


-----

Prior to the expiration of any Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note
may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Notes only if:

    - such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

    - the transferor first deliver to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture that
will govern the notes) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

       - whom the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A; and

       - who is purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Notices**

So long as the Global Notes are held on behalf of a clearing system, notices required to be given to holders of the
notes may be given by their being delivered to that clearing system to be given to the holders of the notes on the
date of delivery to such clearing system. All notices shall also, for so long as the notes are listed and traded on
the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, be published in a leading
newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg and/or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

Our understanding with respect to the organization and operations of Euroclear and Clearstream is as follows.

settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,

**Certain Tax Considerations**

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

**_This disclosure is limited to the U.S. federal tax issues addressed herein. Additional issues may exist that are_**
**_not addressed in this disclosure and that could affect the U.S. federal tax treatment of the notes. Prospective_**
**_investors should seek their own advice based on their particular circumstances from an independent tax_**
**_adviser._**

The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of
notes purchased in this offering at the “issue price,” which we assume will be the price indicated on the cover of
this offering memorandum, and held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion is
limited to consequences relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below).

You are a U.S. Holder if for U.S. federal income tax purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note and are:

    - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

    - a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust (i) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your
particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax and Medicare contribution tax consequences, as well
as differing tax consequences that may apply if you are, for instance:

    - a financial institution;

    - an insurance company;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of accounting;

    - holding notes as part of a hedge, “straddle” or other integrated transaction;

    - an individual or entity whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a tax-exempt entity; or

    - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your
partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities.

This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), administrative
pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, changes to any of
which subsequent to the date of this offering memorandum may affect the tax consequences described herein.
This summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxation, or any taxes other than income
taxes. You should consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to your
particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.

**_Certain Additional Payments_**

There are circumstances in which we might be required to make payments on a note that would increase the yield
of the note, for instance, as described under “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes.” We intend to take the
position that the possibility of such payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment
debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS
takes a contrary position, you may be required to accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as
defined in the Treasury Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to
differ significantly from the actual yield on the notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent
payments are made that differ from the payments based on the comparable yield. In addition, any gain on the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes generally would be treated as interest income
rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax consequences if the notes were
treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not
treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Stated interest on a note (including any tax withheld on payments of stated interest and any Additional Amounts
paid with respect thereto) will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is received,
in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this
discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, interest income on a note will constitute foreign source
income and will generally constitute “passive category income” for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. You may be
entitled to deduct or credit any non-U.S. withholding tax imposed on payments of interest, subject to certain
limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign
taxes for a particular tax year). Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the
applicability of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the notes.

A cash basis U.S. Holder that receives an interest payment denominated in euro will be required to include in
income the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder
generally will not have exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have exchange gain
or loss when the holder disposes of any euro such holder receives (as discussed below under “—Certain
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Exchange of Foreign Currencies”).

In general, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of interest income accrued on the notes in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on
the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that
spans two taxable years, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, an accrual
basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued based on the exchange rate in effect on
the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange
rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Alternatively, if a payment of
interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual
basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of
actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. Holder and will be
irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of an interest payment denominated in euro (including, upon the sale
or other taxable disposition of a note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued
interest previously included in income), the U.S. Holder may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss
(taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated

133


-----

into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued (translated into
U.S. dollars as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition (excluding any amount
attributable to accrued interest, which is treated as described under “—Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations—Payments of Interest”) and your adjusted tax basis in the note.

The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of cash plus the fair market value of all other property received
on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or other taxable
disposition of a note, the amount realized will be translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate on the
date of disposition. If the notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and an
electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the
exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes this
election, the election must be applied consistently by such holder from year to year and cannot be revoked
without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be its cost for the note. The cost of a note purchased
with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price determined based on the exchange rate on
the date of purchase.

A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) on the sale
or other taxable disposition of a note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
Holder’s purchase price of the note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which
the U.S. Holder acquired the note (or, with respect to (i), if such U.S. Holder is a cash basis or electing accrual
basis taxpayer and the notes are treated as being traded on an “established securities market” for this purpose, the
settlement date). Any such exchange gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt
of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the sale or
other taxable disposition by the U.S. Holder. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the
foreign tax credit implications of the sale or other taxable disposition of notes.

Gain or loss in excess of exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale, exchange, redemption or
other taxable disposition of the notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss
generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the notes for more than one year. For
non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult its own tax adviser regarding
the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currencies_**

A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in any euro received as stated interest or any foreign currency received upon
the sale or other taxable disposition of a note equal to the U.S. dollar value based on the exchange rate in effect
on the date of receipt of such euro or other foreign currency. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on a sale
or other taxable disposition of foreign currency, including an exchange of such currency for U.S. dollars, will
generally be U.S. source ordinary income or loss (and will generally not be treated as interest income or
expense).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

In general, a U.S. Holder that is not an “exempt recipient” will be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at
the applicable rate (currently 28%) with respect to payments on the notes and the proceeds of a sale, exchange,

134


-----

redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides its taxpayer identification
number to the applicable withholding agent and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not subject to
backup withholding (generally on an IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and
Certification)), and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S.
Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle
such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. In
addition, payments on the notes made to, and the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition of the notes
received by, a U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient generally will be subject to information reporting
requirements.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Applicable Treasury Regulations require a U.S. Holder to report certain transactions that give rise to a foreign
currency loss in excess of certain thresholds. Under these Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder that recognizes a
foreign currency loss with respect to the notes would be required to report the loss on IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement) if the loss exceeds the thresholds set forth in the Treasury
Regulations. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax adviser regarding the application of the reportable
transaction rules to their purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last
day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year (or such larger values as specified in
applicable Treasury Regulations), generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets
with their tax returns. The notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the notes are held in an account at a U.S. financial institution.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

The U.S. federal income tax discussion set forth above may not be applicable depending upon a U.S. Holder’s
particular situation. Prospective purchasers of the notes should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the
tax consequences to them of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes, including the tax
consequences under state, local, estate, foreign and other tax laws and tax treaties and the possible effects of
changes in U.S. or other tax laws.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Consequences**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes and does not
purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase
or sell the notes. It is based on the laws, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations presently in
force in Luxembourg at the date of this offering memorandum, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be
construed to be, legal or tax advice. This summary does not take into account the specific circumstances of
particular investors. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state,
local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

_Please be aware that the residence concept used in the sub-headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax_
_assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or_
_withholding of a similar nature refers only to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts. Also, please note that a_
_reference to Luxembourg income tax generally encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des_
_collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au_
_fonds pour l’emploi), the temporary equalization tax (impôt d’équilibrage budgétaire) as well as personal_
_income tax (impôt sur le revenu). Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well_
_as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge_
_invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are_

135


-----

_generally subject to personal income tax, the solidarity surcharge and the temporary equalization tax. Under_
_certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or_
_business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well._

A noteholder will not become resident, or be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of the
holding of the notes, or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the notes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Non-resident Noteholders_

Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect, there is no withholding tax (“WHT”) on payments of interest
(including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident noteholder. There is also no
Luxembourg WHT upon repayment of the principal, premium, sale, refund, redemption or repurchase of the
notes.

_Resident Noteholders_

Under the Luxembourg law dated December 23, 2015 as amended (the “Law”), a 10% WHT is levied as of
January 1, 2006 on interest or similar income payments (accrued since July 1, 2005) made by Luxembourg
paying agents to Luxembourg individual residents or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner
who is resident in Luxembourg. This WHT also applies on accrued interest received upon disposal, redemption
or repurchase of the notes. Such WHT will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an
individual acting in the course of management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of tax
in application of the Law is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the Law.

**_Income Tax_**

_Non-resident Noteholders_

Non-resident noteholders, not having a permanent establishment or, a permanent representative, to which or
whom the notes or income therefrom are attributable, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes on income
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the notes. A gain realized by such
non-resident noteholders on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes is further not subject to
Luxembourg income tax.

Non-resident corporate noteholders or individual noteholders acting in the course of managing a professional or
business undertaking who have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to
which or whom the notes or income therefrom are attributable are subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums and issue discounts from the notes and on any gains realized upon the
sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes.

_Resident Noteholders_

_Individuals. A resident noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to_
Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the notes.
A gain realized by an individual noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth,
upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided
this sale or disposal takes place more than six months after the notes were acquired. An individual noteholder
who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax
purposes, must also include the portion of the gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid income in respect of the
notes in his/her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated separately in the
agreement.

136


-----

A resident individual acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking to which
the notes are attributable must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue
discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes, in its taxable
income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are determined as being the difference
between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost
or book value of the notes sold or redeemed.

_Corporation. A resident corporate noteholder subject to income taxation must include any interest accrued or_
received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any
form whatsoever, of the notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

_Luxembourg noteholders benefiting from a special tax regime. Luxembourg noteholders subject to certain special_
tax regimes such as, for example, (1) specialized investment funds governed by the law of February 13, 2007 (as
amended), (2) family wealth management companies governed by the law of May 11, 2007 (as amended) or
(3) undertakings for collective investment governed by the amended law of December 17, 2010 (as amended) are
exempt from Luxembourg income taxes. Interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount
and gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes by such noteholders are not
subject to income tax. Taxable gains are determined as being the difference between the sale, repurchase or
redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the notes sold
or redeemed.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

A Luxembourg resident noteholder, as well as a non-resident noteholder, who has a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg
net wealth tax on such Notes, except if the noteholder is (i) a resident or non-resident individual, (ii) an
undertaking for collective investment subject to the law of December 17, 2010 (as amended), (iii) a specialised
investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, or (iv) a family wealth management
company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007.

A Luxembourg resident securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22, 2004 on
securitization and a Luxembourg resident company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture
capital vehicles should include the market value of such notes into the determination of their minimum net
wealth tax charge according to the amended law of October 16, 1934 on net wealth tax.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the
notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the notes or a transfer of the notes.

**_Other Taxes_**

Neither the issuance nor the transfer of notes will give rise to any Luxembourg stamp duty, issuance tax,
registration tax, transfer tax or similar taxes or duties unless the documents relating to the notes are voluntarily
registered in Luxembourg or presented during a court proceeding in Luxembourg. Where a noteholder is a
resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the notes are included in his/her taxable
estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or registered in
Luxembourg.

**Certain ERISA Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase or holding of the notes by or
with the assets of an employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), a plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement that is
subject to Section 4975 of the Code or any entity whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets”
under ERISA (each, a “Plan”). This section also may be relevant to any person that proposes to purchase or hold
the notes with the assets of employee benefit plans that are governmental plans, as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA, church plans, as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA, and foreign plans, as described in Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA which may be subject to federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations which are substantially
similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) (each, a “Non-ERISA Arrangement”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan and prohibit a Plan from
engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” with persons who are “parties in interest” under
ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code with respect to such Plan. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of such a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to such a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the notes should consult with its counsel regarding
the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will
not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement
of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase of notes. In considering an
investment in the notes by or with the assets of a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement, the applicable fiduciary
should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
plan or arrangement and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any other Similar Laws relating to a
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code or applicable
Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A
party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction with respect to a Plan
may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code; in addition, the
fiduciary of a Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase or hold any notes should consider, among other things, whether
such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between such Plan and a
“party in interest” under ERISA or a “disqualified person” under the Code with respect to such Plan, (ii) the sale
or exchange of any property between such Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person with respect to
such Plan, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person with
respect to such Plan, of such Plan’s assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without
limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or the guarantors. Thus, there is a risk that the acquisition, holding
and/or disposition of the notes by a Plan could constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction

138


-----

under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code and therefore could result under ERISA in a claim
against a Plan fiduciary for a breach of fiduciary duty and other liabilities and could result under the Code in an
excise tax assessment and other liabilities to the Issuer, the initial purchasers and/or the guarantors, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption, or there is some other basis on which the purchase, holding and disposition of the notes
will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and is not
prohibited under applicable Similar Laws.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that
may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase or
holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1 (for specified transactions
involving employee benefit plans and broker dealers, reporting dealers and banks), PTCE 84-14, as amended (for
specified transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTCE 90-1 (for specified
transactions involving insurance company separate accounts), PTCE 91-38, as amended (for specified
transactions involving bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60, as amended (for specified transactions
involving insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (for specified transactions
effected by in-house asset managers). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code may provide a limited exemption for the purchase and sale of the notes and related lending transactions,
provided that neither the Issuer of the notes or nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of the Plan involved
in the transaction and provided further that the Plan pays no more, and receives no less, than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the
self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified
in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily
cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of a Plan that is
considering an investment in the notes in reliance on any of these statutory or class exemptions should carefully
review such exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do
not provide any, assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. We also note that
Non-ERISA Arrangements are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may
be subject to Similar Laws that contain fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions.

Because of the foregoing, the notes may not be purchased or held by any Plan or any Non-ERISA Arrangement
unless the purchase, holding and disposition of the notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and is not prohibited under applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of any note, each purchaser, holder and subsequent transferee of such note will be
deemed to have represented and warranted, in its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that either (i) no portion of the
assets used to acquire or hold a note constitutes the assets of a Plan nor a Non-ERISA Arrangement or (ii) its
acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the note will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and is not prohibited under any applicable
Similar Laws.

Further, by acceptance of any note, each purchaser, holder and subsequent transferee of such note will be deemed
to have acknowledge and agreed, in its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that (i) it (or its fiduciary) has made and
shall make all investment decisions for it, and it has not relied and shall not rely in any way upon the Company,
the subsidiary guarantors, the initial purchasers, the agents or any of their respective affiliates to act as a fiduciary
or adviser to it with respect to (A) the design and terms of such note, (B) its investment in such note, or (C) the
exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights it has under or with respect to such note; (ii) the Company, the initial
purchasers, the agents and their respective affiliates have acted and will act solely for their own account in
connection with all transactions relating to such note; (iii) the interests of the Company, the initial purchasers, the

139


-----

agents and their respective affiliates are adverse to the interests of such purchaser, holder, or subsequent
transferee; and (iv) neither the Company, the initial purchasers, the agents nor any of their respective affiliates is
a fiduciary or adviser of such purchaser, holder, or subsequent transferee in connection with any such assets,
positions or transactions, and any information that the Company, the initial purchasers, the agents or any of their
respective affiliates may provide is not intended to be impartial investment advice.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as
legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved
in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries of any Plan or Non-ERISA
Arrangement, or other persons considering purchasing any note for or on behalf of or with “plan assets” of any
Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be
applicable to the purchase and holding of the note. The notes are contractual financial instruments. The financial
exposure provided by the notes is not a substitute or proxy for, and is not intended as a substitute or proxy for,
individualized investment management or advice for the benefit of any purchaser or holder of any note. The
notes have not been designed and will not be administered in a manner intended to reflect the individualized
needs and objectives of any purchaser or holder of any note.

Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase, holding and disposition
of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA or the Code (or in the case of a Non-ERISA Arrangement, any applicable Similar
Laws). The sale of any notes to any Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by us or
any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect
to investments by any such Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such investment is appropriate for any such
Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement.

Each fiduciary or other person considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with “plan assets” of, any Plan
or Non-ERISA Arrangement, should consult with its legal advisor regarding the potential consequences of such
investment and whether a prohibited transaction exemption, or similar relief under Similar Laws, is available.

**Plan of Distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement among us, the subsidiary guarantors and
the initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to
purchase from us, the entire principal amount of the notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase
notes from us, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers will purchase
all of the notes being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement if any of them are purchased.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the applicable issue price that appears on
the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the
offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their
affiliates.

In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that:

- we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our debt securities (other than
the notes) for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of
Barclays Bank PLC.

- we will indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of
those liabilities.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other place. In the
purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has agreed that:

- the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those
registration requirements.

- during the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in compliance
with Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the
United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements
of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another
exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

The notes are a new issue of securities and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. We do
not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on any securities exchange or an automated dealer quotation system,
except that we expect to apply for a listing of the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and for admission to trading of the notes on the Euro MTF Market. There are no assurances that the notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or that they will be admitted to trading on the Euro
MTF Market. The Issuer may change the exchange on which the notes are listed in the future without notice. See
“Listing and General Information.” Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not develop. The initial
purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not
obligated to do so, and any market making with respect to the notes may be discontinued without notice.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and
other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

141


-----

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the
notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate
covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect
of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes or cause the price of the notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or
syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial
and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and
may in the future engage, in investment banking, commercial banking and other financial advisory and
commercial dealings with us and our affiliates for which they received or will receive customary fees and
expenses. In particular, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates,
officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve
or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of HBI (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or
otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with HBI. The initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any
time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities
and instruments. Certain of the initial purchasers are not registered U.S. broker-dealers and therefore will only
effect offers or sales of the notes in the United States through affiliates that are registered U.S. broker-dealers.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these
initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.

We expect delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2016, which is
the business day following the date of the pricing of the notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to that
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing of the
notes or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will
settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade, to prevent failed
settlement and should consult their own advisers.

**Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited
investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the

Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and_
_certain of the guarantors are incorporated or organized, and a summary of certain insolvency limitations and_
_limitations on the validity and enforceability of the guarantees. The following description is only a summary and_
_does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity_
_and enforceability of the notes and the guarantees. Prospective investors in the notes should consult their own_
_legal advisers with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and the guarantors incorporated in France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are incorporated
under the laws of member states of the European Union (each such state, a “Member State”).

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, on insolvency proceedings, as amended
(the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of
the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of
where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company
has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof
to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a
debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of
factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including, in particular, where board meetings
are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the
location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main
interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have
competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of
the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company
is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against
that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An
“establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic
activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member
State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings
have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests, any proceedings
opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment (secondary
proceedings) are limited to “winding up proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where
main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been
opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an
establishment only where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the
company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (ii) the territorial insolvency
proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered
office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective of
whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to
certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has
assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

146


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction
to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers
conferred on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of
the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings
have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a
request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

On May 20, 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation of the Council of the European Union
amending the EU Insolvency Regulation. The text of the regulation appeared in the Official Journal on 5 June
2015 (OJ L 141/19) and the amended EU Insolvency Regulation (the “Recast Regulation”) entered into force on
26 June 2015. The Recast Regulation will only apply (except for certain provisions) to insolvency proceedings
opened from the second anniversary of its entry into force (i.e., June 26, 2017). In the interim the provisions of
the existing EU Insolvency Regulation shall continue to apply. The Recast Regulation will have direct effect in
each EU Member State (except for Denmark) without the need for separate enactment at a national level.
Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisers with respect to the potential impact of the Recast
Regulation on any investment in this transaction (without limitation to their need to seek legal advice on this
transaction more broadly).

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency Considerations_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and as such any insolvency
proceedings applicable to such a company is in principle governed by Luxembourg law. The insolvency laws of
Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that a
Luxembourg company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction
or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Luxembourg District Court, sitting in commercial matters (the “Commercial Court”), should have, in
principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to each Luxembourg Obligor, each
entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and “centre of main
interest” (centre des intérêts principaux) (“COMI”), as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in Luxembourg,
such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to the EU Insolvency Regulation,
the place of the registered office of a company shall be presumed to be the center of its main interests in the
absence of proof to the contrary. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of each
Luxembourg Obligor is located in Luxembourg and consequently that the Commercial Court would have
jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation), such
proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the localization of the COMI (including the COMI of
a Luxembourg Obligor) is a question of fact, which may change from time to time.

Accordingly, the following types of proceedings (together, “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against an
entity having its registered office or center of principal interests in Luxembourg:

    - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg company
itself, by any of its creditors or ex officio by the Commercial Court. Following such a request, the
courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is in a state of cessation

147


-----

of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) cumulatively has lost its commercial creditworthiness
(ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy
proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). Bankruptcy proceedings
are primarily designed to realize the assets of the bankrupt entity in order to pay off its debts. One of
the main effects of such proceedings is the stay of proceedings: unsecured creditors and creditors with
a general priority right would, as of the bankruptcy order, no longer be permitted to take any action
based on title to movable and immovable assets, nor any enforcement action against a Luxembourg
Obligor’s movable or immovable assets;

    - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) which are governed by a grand-ducal decree of
May 24, 1935 (the “Decree”), are available to a Luxembourg Obligor, in the event that it no longer has
creditworthiness or is experiencing difficulties in meeting all of its commitments. The opening of a
controlled management proceeding may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and
under which a court may order a provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement
of claims by secured creditors;

    - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by a
Luxembourg Obligor only after having received a prior consent from a majority of its creditors holding
75% at least of the claims against a Luxembourg Obligor. The obtaining of such composition
proceedings will trigger a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors;

    - stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or putting the company into judicial liquidation (liquidation
_judiciaire); and_

    - judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in violation of the commercial
code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liability in respect of the notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in
particular, bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any
debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. For example, preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (Administration des Contributions Directes);

    - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise
(Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines);

    - social security contributions; and

    - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon
the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

In addition, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Impact of Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_**

During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain
secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited particularly in the event of controlled
management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has

148


-----

been taken by the Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a
reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the
creditors representing more than 50% of a Luxembourg Obligor’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you
should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an
event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Generally, payments made, as well as other transactions (listed in the pertinent section of the Luxembourg
Commercial Code) concluded or performed, during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the
Commercial Court and dates back not more than six months from the date on which the Commercial Court
formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional
period of ten days before the commencement of such period, are subject to cancellation by the Commercial Court
upon proceedings instituted by the Luxembourg bankruptcy receiver. In particular:

    - article 445 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code sets out that specific transactions entered into during
the hardening period and an additional period of ten days preceding the hardening period fixed by the
Commercial Court are null and void (including the disposals by a Luxembourg Obligor of movable and
immovable assets without consideration or with inadequate consideration; payments whether in cash or
by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means for non-matured debts; payments that have
not been in cash or by way of negotiable and non-negotiable papers for matured debts and the granting
of security interests for antecedent debts);

    - article 446 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code provides that the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
and initiate nullity actions in the following events: (i) payments made for matured debts for
considerations; and (ii) other transactions realized during the hardening period, if the contracting party
has knowledge of the cessation of payments;

    - article 447 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code provides that the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
and initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted either ten days prior
to or after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have elapsed between the granting
of the mortgage or privilege and its registration; and

    - regardless of the hardening period, article 448 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and article 1167
of the Luxembourg Civil Code (actio pauliana) give the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver or the
creditor the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy,
without limitation of time.

**_Continuance of Ongoing Contracts_**

The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor,
provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any
prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

    - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

    - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be
performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the

149


-----

bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim
will rank pari passu with the claims of all of the other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the
relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

**_Limitation on Guarantee_**

The granting of guarantees by a Luxembourg company is subject to specific limitations and requirements relating
to corporate object and corporate benefit. The granting of guarantees by a company incorporated and existing in
The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg must not be prohibited by the corporate object (objet social) and/or legal form
of that company. In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of third party guarantee
by a company has to be for its “corporate benefit.”

Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate
benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect
economic or commercial benefit. The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect
subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of cross-stream and upstream third
party guarantees may be more problematic. Failure to comply with the above mentioned corporate benefit
requirement will typically result in liability of the directors of the Luxembourg company granting such third
party guarantee. The question whether a third party guarantee granted in the absence of corporate interest could
be held null and void is discussed among legal doctrine. While some authors express the view that an absence of
corporate interest could give rise to liability of the directors of the relevant company only, others consider that
the consequences could be that the relevant obligations be null and void.

In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors of the Luxembourg company, a guarantee
provided by a Luxembourg company could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public
policy (ordre public) (in case of facts consisting a misuse of corporate assets).

However, in case of a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt de groupe) exists such group interest
could prevent a third party guarantee provided by a Luxembourg company from falling foul of the above
constraints to the extent that the following cumulative criteria are met and proven:

    - the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective
commitments of all the affiliates;

    - the financial assistance must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means, in which case it is
typical for the guarantee to be limited to between 85-95% of the assisting company’s net assets
(capitaux propres) and the subordinated debt as determined by article 34 of the Luxembourg law of
December 19, 2002 on the Register of Commerce and Companies, on accounting and on annual
accounts of the companies as amended; and

    - the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed
at a common objective.

As a result, third party guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to certain limitations,
which usually take the form of a general limitation language, which is inserted in the relevant finance
document(s) and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting
company under all finance documents.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any security interests/guarantees granted by entities organized in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which
constitute a breach of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by Article 49-6 of the Luxembourg law
dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, or any other similar provisions might not be
enforceable.

150


-----

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the notes and the indenture that will govern the notes (and any other document in connection
therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg may be required in the
case of legal proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that the notes and the indenture that will
govern the notes (and any other document in connection therewith) must be produced before an official
Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée). In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem
duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered)
will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the notes, the indenture that will
govern the notes (and any other document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court
be translated into French or German.

**British Virgin Islands**

One guarantor, Maidenform (Asia) Limited, is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

Any insolvency proceedings by or against a company resident in the British Virgin Islands would likely be based
on the insolvency laws of the British Virgin Islands, including the Insolvency Act 2003 (the “BVI Insolvency
Act”) and the Insolvency Rules 2005 (the “BVI Insolvency Rules”). In this regard, although Part XVIII of the
BVI Insolvency Act contains provisions based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross- Border Insolvency in
relation to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in relation to the insolvency of companies incorporated in the British
Virgin Islands, Part XVIII is currently not in force. However, Part XIX of the BVI Insolvency Act is in force and
allows for orders to be made in the British Virgin Islands in aid of foreign insolvency proceedings in certain
designated countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

As noted above, corporate insolvency in the British Virgin Islands is governed by the BVI Insolvency Act and
the BVI Insolvency Rules. These laws are closely based on the previous Insolvency Act 1986 of the UK as
originally enacted. However the provisions for administration in the BVI Insolvency Act, which are similar to the
provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 of the UK prior to its amendment and replacement by the Enterprise Act
2002 and subsequent legislation, and which promote the rescue of companies in financial difficulty assisted by a
statutory moratorium, are not yet in force

The key current insolvency procedures in the British Virgin Islands are liquidation, creditor arrangements,
receivership and administrative receivership.

A party, who has standing, pursuant to the provisions of the BVI Insolvency Act, may make an application to the
British Virgin Islands court for the appointment of a liquidator to a British Virgin Islands company if it is
insolvent (as defined in the BVI Insolvency Act) or it is just and equitable or in the public interest that a
liquidator should be appointed. In terms of a British Virgin Islands company that has granted a guarantee or
security, and the guarantee or security has become enforceable as against the BVI company, then if the creditor
considers that the British Virgin Islands company is insolvent, the creditor may apply to the British Virgin
Islands court for the appointment of a liquidator to the British Virgin Islands company.

In the event of the appointment of a liquidator to a British Virgin Islands company pursuant to the provisions of the
BVI Insolvency Act, from the commencement of the liquidation of the British Virgin Islands company, unless the
British Virgin Islands court otherwise orders, no person may commence or proceed with any action or proceeding
against the British Virgin Islands company or in relation to its assets (in effect, the appointment of a liquidator triggers
an automatic stay of proceedings against the British Virgin Islands company) and no share in the British Virgin Islands
company may be transferred. However, the relevant provisions of the BVI Insolvency Act do not affect the rights of a
secured creditor (such as the holder of a fixed charge) to take possession of and realise or otherwise deal with assets of
the British Virgin Islands company over which the creditor has a security interest. Ordinarily, the debt due under a
guarantee would be an unsecured claim in the liquidation unless such debt is otherwise subject to security.

151


-----

Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, in the event of the insolvent liquidation of a British Virgin Islands
company, any transaction entered into by the British Virgin Islands company within the vulnerability period (which
is the period of six months prior to the onset of insolvency in the case of a transaction with an unconnected third
party, or the period of two years prior to the onset of insolvency in the case of a transaction with a connected
person) may be subject to challenge by the appointed liquidator, if the liquidator considers the transaction is
voidable.

A voidable transaction would include an unfair preference. For a transaction to be voidable as an unfair
preference the transaction must be an “insolvency transaction” (which is defined to be a transaction that is
entered into at a time when the British Virgin Islands company was insolvent or causes the British Virgin Islands
company to become insolvent). The “insolvency transaction” must also be entered into within the vulnerability
period and it must otherwise amount to an unfair preference. An ‘‘unfair preference’’ includes a transaction
which has the effect of putting a creditor of the British Virgin Islands company into a position which, in the event
of the British Virgin Islands company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position it would
have been in if the transaction had not been entered into.

If a transaction is determined by the British Virgin Islands court to be a voidable transaction then there are a
number of possible remedies that may be ordered. In particular, the British Virgin Islands court may, for
example, order that the obligations of the British Virgin Islands company under any guarantee or security granted
by the British Virgin Islands company may be set-aside, and or any payments made as a consequence of the
voidable transaction could be clawed back by a liquidator of the British Virgin Islands company.

**Cayman Islands**

Two guarantors, Choloma, Inc. and Hanesbrands Dos Rios Textiles, Inc., are incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

When a winding-up order is made by the Cayman Islands Court (the “Court”) or a voluntary winding-up is
subject to Court supervision (i.e. in an official liquidation), an automatic moratorium on proceedings against the
company (or its assets) is imposed from the date of commencement of the liquidation pursuant to such winding
up order or voluntary winging up —that is, proceedings may not be commenced against the company (or its
assets) without the express permission of the Court. Dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations
in the status of shareholders effected after the commencement of official liquidation proceedings are void, unless
the Court orders otherwise. The moratorium does not prevent a secured creditor from realizing its security, nor
does it affect any valid rights of set-off or subordination agreements acquired or entered into before the
commencement of the official liquidation.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule.
This rule applies in relation to ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the
presentation of the winding-up petition, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the date
of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly created security
interest over property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce his security without reference to the
official liquidators and without the leave of the Court.

Preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured creditors of a company. Preferred
creditors under the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Law”) will rank ahead
of unsecured creditors and secured creditors where the secured creditors’ security is in the nature of a floating
charge. Furthermore, all costs, charges and expenses properly incurred in the voluntary winding up of a
company, including the remuneration of the liquidators, are payable out of the assets of the company in priority
to all other unsecured claims.

152


-----

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by section 86 of the Companies Law which
provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them shall, if
sanctioned by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or a class of creditors. If there are creditors who form a
class, the class will be bound by the scheme if a majority representing 75% in value of the creditors or class of
creditors who attended (whether in person or by proxy) and voted, approved the scheme. Cayman Islands
authority suggests that a class is constituted by “those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it
impossible for them to consult together with a view to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more
creditors are likely to constitute separate classes in a compromise or arrangement if they hold security over
different assets or hold security over the same asset but do not rank equally.

Enforcement may be limited by section 99 of the Companies Law which provides that, when a winding up order has
been made, any disposition of the company’s property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the
company’s members made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.

Section 97 of the Companies Law provides:

(i) “when a winding up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed no suit, action or other
proceedings, including criminal proceedings, shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company
except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose; and

(ii) when a winding up order has been made, any attachment, distress or execution put in force against the
estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up is void.”

However, Section 142(1) of the Companies Law confirms that, notwithstanding that a winding up order has been
made, a creditor who has security over the whole or part of the assets of a company is entitled to enforce his
security without the leave of the Court and without reference to the liquidator.

It should also be noted that Section 96 of the Companies Law provides that a court in the Cayman Islands may at
any time after the presentation of the petition for the winding up of a company and before the making of a
winding up order where any action or proceedings are pending in the summary court, the Court, the Court of
Appeal, the Privy Council or in a foreign court restrain such proceedings accordingly “on such terms as [the
Court] thinks fit.” In practice, the scope and effect of the stay under Section 96 is the same as Section 97.

A liquidator may at any time give notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that he proposes, at the expiration of
28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.

Section 145 of the Companies Law provides that every conveyance or transfer of property, or charge thereon, and
every payment obligation and judicial proceeding, made, incurred, taken or suffered by a company at a time
when that company was unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 93 of the Companies Law, and
made or granted in favour of a creditor with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors of
the company, would be invalid pursuant to section 145(1) of the Companies Law, if made, incurred, taken or
suffered within the six months preceding the commencement of a liquidation of such company. Such actions will
be deemed to have been made with a view to giving such creditor a preference if it is a “related party” of the
company. A creditor shall be treated as a related party if it has the ability to control the company or exercise
significant influence over the company in making financial and operating decisions.

Any disposition of property made at an undervalue by or on behalf of a company and with an intent to defraud its
creditors (which means an intention to wilfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor), shall be voidable:

(i) under section 146(2) of the Companies Law at the instance of the company’s official liquidator; and

(ii) under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands, at the instance of a creditor
thereby prejudiced,

153


-----

provided that in either case, no such action may be commenced more than six years after the date of the relevant
disposition.

**France**

Four guarantors, Hanes Central Services Europe S.A.S., Hanes Finance Europe S.A.S., Hanes France S.A.S and
Hanes Operations S.A.S., are incorporated in France and may be subject to French laws governing creditors’
rights and insolvency proceedings, including court assisted informal pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc
or conciliation proceedings) and court administered insolvency proceedings (safeguard (sauvegarde),
reorganization (redressement) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings).

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in France (including provisions of
Ordinance No. 2014-326 dated March 12, 2014 and in force as from July 1, 2014 and Law No. 2015-990 dated
August 6, 2015 and known as “loi Macron”) for informational purposes only and does not address all the French
legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the notes.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a guarantee provided by a French company, such guarantee will be
subject to the following limitations:

(A) the obligations and liabilities of a company incorporated in France (a “French Guarantor”) under any
guarantee or any security interest granted by it shall not include any obligation or liability which, if
incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of article L. 225-216 of
the French Commercial Code and/or would constitute an infringement of the provisions of article
L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code or any other law or regulations having
the same effect, as interpreted by French courts. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is
prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for
the purpose of its acquisition;

(B) should a guarantee be granted by a French Guarantor which is a subsidiary of the Issuer, a guarantee
limitation amount would apply corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of
the notes applied by the Issuer for the direct or indirect benefit of that French Guarantor through any
intercompany loans and/or cash pooling arrangements to that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made under the guarantee. Accordingly, the
obligations and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its guarantee shall be limited, at any time, to the
proceeds of the notes (if any) made available by the Issuer to such French Guarantor and/or any
subsidiaries of such French Guarantor (if any) under intercompany loan or cash pooling arrangements
or similar arrangements, in each case to the extent such loans are outstanding to the French Guarantor
and/or its subsidiaries at the time when a payment is required under the guarantee, it being specified
that any payment made by a French company under this guarantee shall automatically reduce pro tanto
the outstanding amount of the relevant intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French
company to the parent company or its subsidiaries. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s
obligation under the guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its guarantee; and

(C) the obligations and liabilities of a French company for the obligations of any obligor which is its
subsidiary will cover all amounts due by such obligor as borrower under any applicable finance
document and as obligor (the “Guaranteed Obligor”). However, where such Guaranteed Obligor is not
incorporated in France, the amounts payable by the French company under this paragraph (C) in
respect of the obligations of the Guaranteed Obligor as guarantor, shall be limited as set out in
paragraph (B) above.

154


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, any obligations or liabilities that may arise from a French company acting jointly and
severally with other guarantors (including, as applicable, as co-débiteur solidaire) are subject always to the
limitations set out in the preceding paragraphs.”

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less
than the economic benefit such French guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length
basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could
be taxable under certain circumstances.

French courts could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the
relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that
the French guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the
grant of the guarantee as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit as regards a French
Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as
to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third party obligations, the guarantee
must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. French case law has
recognised that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of
the relevant company, particularly if the following four criteria are fulfilled:

- the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders) operating under a
common strategy aimed at a common objective;

- the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the framework of a
policy implemented by the group of companies;

- the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change the existing
balance between the respective obligations of the relevant affiliates; and

- the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit. The French Guarantor must
receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the
granting by it of the guarantee and the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee shall not
exceed its financial capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate
with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to
which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative, the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery
plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the
creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its
means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be
declared unenforceable against third parties if:

- the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so;

- the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in
its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and

155


-----

- at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or
should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in
their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such
knowledge of the counterparty is necessary).

If a court found that the issuance of the notes or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that
did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the notes or the granting of such guarantee
could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the
claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the notes may not enjoy the
benefit of the notes or the guarantees and the value of any consideration that holders of the notes received with
respect to the notes could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the notes and, possibly, from subsequent
transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the notes might be held liable for any damages
incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, creditors can be subject to Articles 1244 1 et seq. of the French
Civil Code. Pursuant to these articles, French courts may, in any civil proceedings involving the debtor, whether
initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s
financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations over a maximum period
of two years and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear
interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate published annually by
decree) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal rather than interest. If a court
order under Article 1244-1 of the French Civil Code is made, it will automatically suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during
the period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits
from the opening of a conciliation proceedings, these provisions shall be read in combination with Article L.
611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see below).

**_Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for several warning
procedures. When there are elements which the statutory auditors of a company believe put the company’s
existence as a going concern in jeopardy, they must request the management and the board of directors (if the
company is incorporated under the legal form of a société anonyme) to provide an explanation of the company’s
situation. Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a shareholders’
meeting be convened. The auditors also must inform the commercial court. Shareholders representing at least 5%
of the share capital and the workers’ committee of a company have similar rights. The commercial court can also
itself summon the management to provide explanations on elements which the court believes put the company’s
existence as a going concern in jeopardy. Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 611-2-1 of the French
Commercial Code, the competent civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) will also be able to exercise the
emergency procedure for debtors submitted to its jurisdiction.

**_Ad Hoc Agent (mandat ad hoc)_**

A company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is still able to pay its debts as they fall due out of its
available assets) may request to the court the appointment of an ad hoc agent (mandataire ad hoc). The ad hoc
agent’s duties are determined by the court. Such ad hoc agents are usually appointed in order to facilitate the
negotiations with creditors, but they cannot coerce the creditors to accept any proposal. Creditors are not barred
from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they usually accept not to.
_Mandat ad hoc proceedings are confidential and are not limited in time. The agreement reached by the parties (if_
any) with the help of the ad hoc agent is reported by the latter to the court but is not sanctioned by the court. In
any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth above.

156


-----

Although not expressly mentioned in the provisions governing mandat ad hoc in the French Commercial Code,
_mandat ad hoc proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating_
creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to
implementing such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings. To ensure transparency, the
public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such mandat ad hoc proceedings.

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing
the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of an ad hoc agent or any request made to this
end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of
_mandat ad hoc proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of creditors’ counsel relating to such proceedings are_
deemed null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of
Justice (currently: 75% of the fees).

**_Conciliation Proceedings_**

A company may, in its sole discretion, apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings (procédure de
_conciliation) with respect to itself, provided it (i) is able to pay its due debts out of its available assets, or has_
been unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets for less than 45 days and (ii) experiences legal,
economic or financial difficulties. If a competent court decides to grant the petition, it will appoint a conciliator
(conciliateur) to help the company reach an agreement with its creditors and/or trade partners for reducing or
rescheduling its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to five months. This
agreement may be either, upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court or,
upon the debtor’s request, approved (homologué) by the court.

The acknowledgement of the agreement by the president of the court gives the agreement the legal force of a
final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title that can be enforced by the parties without further
recourse to a judge (titre exécutoire), although the conciliation proceedings will remain confidential.

The approval by the court, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will disclose the existence of
conciliation proceedings, the guarantees and priorities (privilèges) granted to the creditors (but will not make
public the terms of the conciliation agreement) and will have the following specific consequences:

- creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the
distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a priority of payment over all preproceedings and post-proceedings claims (other than certain employment claims and post-proceedings procedural
costs), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and

- in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date
of the cessation des paiements and therefore the commencement date of the “hardening” period (période
_suspecte) cannot be fixed by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval of the conciliation_
agreement by the court (see below for the definition of the date of the cessation des paiements and of the
“hardening” period), except in case of fraud; and

- in the event of subsequent Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, or Judicial
Reorganization proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the “new money privilege” may not
be rescheduled without their holders’ consent.

When acknowledging or approving the conciliation agreement, the president of the court or the court may
appoint, upon request of the debtor, the conciliator as mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord to supervise the
performance of the agreement for the period corresponding to the duration of this conciliation agreement.

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract by diminishing the rights or increasing the
obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the opening of conciliation proceedings or any request made to this

end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of
_conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of creditors’ counsel relating to such proceedings are_
deemed null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of
Justice (currently: seventy-five percent of the fees). While the conciliation agreement (whether acknowledged or
approved) is being implemented, by law: (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims
governed by the conciliation agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued interests of the claims governed by the
conciliation agreement cannot bear themselves interests and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the
President of the Court who opened conciliation proceedings for debt rescheduling (pursuant to Article 1244-1 of
the French Civil Code mentioned above) in relation to creditors (other than public creditors) who were called to
the conciliation with respect to their claims which are not governed by the conciliation agreement, in which case
the decision would be taken after having heard the mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord appointed to supervise
the performance of the restructuring agreement, if the conciliator has been appointed in such capacity and taking
into account the actual performance of the restructuring agreement by the debtor.

A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) can benefit
from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the
approved or acknowledged agreement (Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code).

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its
termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, to the
exception of those amounts already paid to them.

Conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating
creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to
implementing such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings. To ensure transparency, the
public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such conciliation proceedings.

Finally, conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a
large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the thresholds required for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will
be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, as described below.

**_Safeguard Proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde)_**

The safeguard proceedings allow for the establishment of a restructuring plan negotiated with the creditors under
court supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at the request of a debtor company.
The objectives of safeguard proceedings are to facilitate the debtor’s reorganization in order to safeguard the
debtor’s activity and employment and to pay creditors. The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due
debts out of its available assets) but experiencing difficulties that it cannot overcome. Safeguard proceedings are
public and include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for an
additional six months with court approval and which can be extended, under exceptional circumstances, to a
maximum of 18 months upon request of the public prosecutor.

During that observation period, which may last up to 18 months, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire), whose name can be suggested by the debtor, investigates the business of the company and helps the_
company to elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde).

During the safeguard proceedings, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the opening of the
proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior
debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or recover goods
or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the
commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary

158


-----

activities or are required by the proceedings must be paid as and when they fall due, and if such is not the case,
they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings.

One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees (mandatory
for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding €20 million, and whose accounts are
certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a certified public accountant (expert
_comptable), optional below such thresholds), one of banks and financial institutions (or assimilated institutions and_
entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor) and the other of suppliers having a claim that
represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers, as well as a general meeting of
note holders (comprising all holders of all notes or bonds issued by the company even if they relate to different issues
and regardless of the law applicable to each issue), in the event the concerned debtor would have issued bonds or notes,
to which the debtor submits proposals to reach agreement on a recovery plan.

The debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of drafting the plan which
will be voted by the committee(s) and the general meeting of noteholders as the case may be. Additionally, each
member of the credit institutions’ committee and each member of the suppliers’ committee may propose an
alternative safeguard or reorganization plan, which will have to obtain the support of all committees and general
meeting of noteholders, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the noteholders are not entitled to propose such a plan.

The committees must accept or reject proposals for a safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of having
received such proposals. For each committee, the plan is approved by such committee, where the members voting
in favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the committee members
expressing a vote. The amounts of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a guarantee granted by the
debtor are not taken into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of
their repayment schedule or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted
or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not take part in the vote.

In cases where bonds or notes have been issued by the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the
committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of note holders where it is also approved by a majority of
two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the note holders expressing a vote.

In respect of voting rights in both committees and general meeting of note holders, each creditor member of a
creditors’ committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the
existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote or providing for the full or partial payment of its
claim by a third party, as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then
submit to the concerned creditor/note holder a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the relevant
creditors’ committee or general meeting of note holders. In the event of a disagreement, the concerned creditor/
note holder or the court-appointed administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the
commercial court in summary proceedings.

Those creditors whose repayment terms are not affected by the draft safeguard plan, or for which the draft plan
provides for full repayment in cash upon approval of the plan or admission of their claims, will not vote in the
framework of the creditors’ committees or the general meeting of noteholders, as applicable. The committees and
the general meeting of note holders, if any, must vote on the plan within six months from the date of the
judgment opening the proceedings. If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved within these six months, this
six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period
not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committeebased consultation process. The plan submitted to the committees and the note holders, if any, may include not
only a rescheduling of debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring the relevant shareholder consent). In that respect it should be noted that (i) if the plan provides for a
capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off with their
claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case may be according to the provisions of the plan, (ii) if the court

159


-----

empowers the court-appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate
resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by-laws (including modifications of its share capital)
required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be
adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least
half of the shares with voting rights.

The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify. The plan
submitted to the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account
intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings.

Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of note holders, if any, and subject to
verification by the court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the court can approve the plan, in
which case the plan will be binding on all creditors and noteholders (including those who did not vote or who
voted against the adoption of the plan). Creditors who are not members of committees and who are not
noteholders are consulted on an individual or collective basis. For those individual creditors with whom an
agreement has not been reached with respect to the payment of their claim, the court can reschedule repayment of
their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the
duration of the plan, in which case their maturity dates remain the same. The court cannot oblige such creditors
to waive any part of their claim. The first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan
(in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be at least 5% of the total
admitted pre-filing liabilities (except for agricultural businesses)).

The court can also impose a plan if one or both of the committees, or the general meeting of noteholders, does
not approve a plan, either by failing to vote within the specified six-month period (which may be extended by the
court at the request of the court-appointed administrator, to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the
observation period) or by rejecting the plan. In such a case, the rules are the same as those applicable to creditors
who are not members of the committees and who are not noteholders (creditors are consulted on an individual or
collective basis and, in particular, the court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a
maximum period of ten years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the duration of the plan,
in which case their maturity dates remain the same).

Finally, at any time during safeguard proceedings, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into
reorganization proceedings (i) at the request of the debtor company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, if the company was already
in cessation des paiements at the opening of the proceedings, (ii) upon its own initiative or upon request of the
debtor company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative, the court-appointed administrator or the public
prosecutor, if the company becomes insolvent or (iii) at the debtor’s request or upon request of the
court-appointed administrator, the court-appointed creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor (if no plan
has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, by the noteholders’ assembly (as described
below)), it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and the company would shortly
become insolvent should the safeguard proceedings be ended. The court may also convert safeguard (provided
the debtor is insolvent) or reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings if recovery of the debtor is
manifestly impossible.

**_Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings_**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) if

(i) while not being in cessation des paiements (i.e., being unable to pay its debts as they fall due out of its
available assets) for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation, it is facing
difficulties that it cannot overcome,

160


-----

(ii) it (a) has its accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and
has (1) more than twenty employees or (2) a turnover greater than €3 million excluding any applicable taxes
or (3) total assets in its balance sheet greater than €1.5 million, or (b) establishes consolidated financial
statements in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code,

(iii) it is subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings and

(iv) it has prepared, in the context of conciliation proceedings, a draft safeguard plan that aims to protect its
operations in the long run and which is likely to be supported, within the group of those creditors who will
be affected by the accelerated safeguard proceedings, by a sufficiently large majority of them to allow the
adoption of the plan by the creditors’ committees and the noteholders’ general meeting within the duration
of the procedure (i.e. three months from the opening judgment of the accelerated safeguard procedure).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” the safeguard proceedings for large
companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is roughly similar to the regular
safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings.
Therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners
benefiting from retention of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law.

Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated safeguard proceedings
are opened, the credit institution committee, the trade creditors’ committee and the general meeting of
noteholders are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the
minimum period of 15 days from delivery of the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings).

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings
may notably provide for rescheduling of debts (provided that the concerned creditors have agreed to such
rescheduling), debt cancellation, or debt-for-equity swaps (requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during this period, no plan is
adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders, the court
shall terminate the accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings_**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that applicable to accelerated
safeguard proceedings, which are now designed as the common “accelerated proceedings” whereas the
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings are designed to “fast-track” safeguard proceedings dealing with
purely financial difficulties.

The key difference between accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is
that the latter relate only to debts owed to financial institutions and noteholders (i.e., debts towards credit institutions
that are eligible members of the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which are eligible
members of the general meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt
with under the safeguard plan. The company continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending, thus
reducing significantly the impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies. Other classes of
creditors, such as suppliers or public creditors, are not therefore affected by the proceedings.

The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings also apply to a
debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, provided that the accounts of the debtor offer
evidence that a plan prepared in the context of conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those

161


-----

financial creditors who will be affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the
preceding paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure (i.e., one month from the
opening judgment of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).

The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in accelerated safeguard proceedings,
except that the credit institutions’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the proposed plan.

The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one month, unless the court
decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities
of the financial creditors and noteholders (the same majority rules apply as in committees in regular safeguard
proceedings), the court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any
uniform debt rescheduling on creditors.

**_Judicial Reorganization (redressement judiciaire)_**

A judicial reorganization may be initiated with respect to a company incorporated in France (or a foreign company
whose center of main interest is situated in France) if it cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it
is in cessation des paiements), provided that its situation is capable of improving and it is capable of recovery.

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the court (in very limited cases only) or the public
prosecutor.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in cessation des
_paiements unless it initiated conciliation proceedings within the same period. If it does not, its de jure managers_
(including the directors) and, as the case may be, its de facto managers, are subject to civil liability.

The aims of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard proceedings. Most of the rules
applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial reorganization proceedings. In particular, the opening of
judicial reorganization proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the debtor for up to a
maximum of 18 months (subject to the same limited exceptions).

As with safeguard proceedings, the debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator, is in
charge of drafting the plan which will be voted on by the creditors’ committee(s) and the general meeting of
noteholders, as the case may be. Additionally, each member of the committee(s) may propose an alternative
reorganization plan (whereas noteholders may not). Committees of creditors and a general meeting of
noteholders may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). The
reorganization plan can combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a re-capitalization of the company, a
debt-for-equity swap (subject to relevant shareholder approval) and the sale of certain assets or of portions of the
business. The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify.
The plan submitted to the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account
intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings.

In the case where the shareholders’ equity has not been restored to a level equal to at least one-half of the share
capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code and the reorganization plan provides for a
modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who undertake to comply with the plan, the
court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in place of the dissenting
shareholders if they refuse to vote such restoration.

In addition, Law No. 2015-990 dated August 6, 2015 (known as “loi Macron”) has introduced a new provision
(Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code) applicable to Judicial Reorganization proceedings opened
as from August 7, 2015 in the cases where

162


-----

(i) a debtor (a) employs more than 150 employees or (b) controls one or more companies employing in total
more than150 employees,

(ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the national or local economy
and to local employment, and

(iii) a share capital modification appears—after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions—the only
credible solution to avoid such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue.

In summary, if, in such event, a reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of
one or more person(s) who undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders) and the existing
shareholders refuse to vote such share capital modification, the court may, under certain procedural and
substantial conditions (e.g., the payment to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of
their shares, as determined by a court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached among the
parties) and upon request of the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, either (i) appoint a trustee
to vote in favor of a share capital increase in place of the dissenting shareholders or (ii) order, in favor of the
person(s) who have undertaken to execute the plan, the transfer of all or part of the shares owned by the
dissenting shareholders who own a majority of voting rights or hold a blocking minority in the company. Any
approval clause is deemed null and void.

If it appears the debtor is not able to ensure the recovery of its business, a total or partial sale of the business can be
ordered by the court, at the request of the court-appointed administrator. In this case, the sale is conducted by the
court-appointed representative of the creditors in accordance with rules applicable to the liquidation procedure.

**_Judicial Liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)_**

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the court (in very limited cases only) or the public
prosecutor if the debtor cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it is in cessation des paiements)
and its recovery is not possible. The aim of these proceedings is to liquidate a company and end its activities, by
selling its business, either as a whole or per branch of activity or asset by asset. The activity is ended from the
opening of proceedings, except if a sale of all or part of the business is feasible. In such a case, the court
authorizes the company to continue its activity during a maximum period of three months (renewable once) to
implement such a sale.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming unable to pay its due
debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements). The bankruptcy judge opens a judicial liquidation
rather than a judicial reorganization when it considers that the debtor is unable to continue its business or that
there are no serious chances of improving the company’s prospects through restructuring. Liquidation
proceedings trigger an automatic stay of proceedings against the company. Secured creditors benefiting from a
pledge are, however, where the law applicable to such security arrangements does not prohibit it, entitled to
enforce their security interest through a court monitored allocation process (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request
the court to transfer ownership of the pledged asset(s)).

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay
off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process
is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets, or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient
funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and
allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

163


-----

**_Void and Voidable Transactions_**

Transactions may be challenged by the court-appointed administrator, court agent, liquidator or public prosecutor
if they are entered into during the so-called “hardening” period (période suspecte) before a judgment opening
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Such period runs from the date on which the company
is deemed to be unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements) and can be
backdated by the court up to 18 months before the judgment opening the relevant insolvency proceedings but not
before the court order approving a conciliation agreement (homologation) Certain transactions entered into by the
debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

Transactions that are automatically void if performed during the hardening period include transactions or
payments that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include, notably, transfers of assets for no consideration or for nominal consideration, contracts
under which the obligations of the company significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party,
payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts due made in a manner which is not
commonly used in the ordinary course of business, security granted for debts previously incurred and provisional
measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of cessation des paiements), the transfer of
any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at
the same time), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guarantee of
pre-existing debts and a notarized declaration of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité notariée) applying
to any assets of the debtor during the “hardening” period.

Transactions that are voidable by the court include transactions or payments made when due after the date of
_cessation des paiements, such as payments made on accrued debts, transfers of assets for consideration and_
notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions
made during the “hardening period”, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the company
knew, or should have known, that it was in a state of cessation des paiements at the relevant time. Transactions
relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when realized during the six-month period
prior to the beginning of the “hardening” period.

There is no “hardening” period prior to the opening of safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent the debtor was not insolvent when such proceedings
were opened.

**_Status of Creditors_**

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings
must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication
of the court order opening the proceedings in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales (by
exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out
of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest): this period is extended to four months
for creditors domiciled outside France. In the case where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of
the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’
representative. When a proof of claim is made on behalf of a creditor, such creditor is allowed to ratify it or, if he
wishes so, to replace it by filing its own proof of claim. Creditors who have not submitted their proof of claims
during the relevant period are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions
made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are unenforceable against the debtor if the
debtor complies with the plan’s provisions. Employees are not subject to such obligations and are preferred
creditors under French law.

From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, the company is prohibited from paying
debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of

164


-----

inter-related debts (dettes connexes) and, provided that such payments are authorized by the court, payments
made to recover assets required for the continued operation of the business. During this period, creditors may not
pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order
commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

- to obtain an order for or payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court fix the amount due);

- to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the company; or

- to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset is located in
another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon
would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des paiements are not enforceable under French
law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s
obligations. If, however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all or part of
the business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet arrived at maturity shall only mature as at
the date of the judgment ordering such sale or upon expiry of the period of continued activity authorized by the
court.

The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes
the debtor will not be able to continue to perform, or, on the contrary, to continue such contracts, and in the latter
case can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the company
may have been in default, provided that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and,
in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, that the debtor pays cash on
delivery).

In the context of Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings, the above rules would
only apply to the creditors which are subject to the Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard
(see above). In addition, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the
conciliation proceedings which is certified by its statutory auditors and filed with the commercial court and
which is deemed to be a filing of their proof of claim by such creditors if they do not file their claim within the
general deadlines applicable in other insolvency proceedings referred to above.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, the
bankruptcy court, officials appointed by the bankruptcy court as required by the insolvency proceedings,
post-petition creditors, certain secured creditors and the French treasury.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code, where insolvency proceedings or safeguard have
been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor
on the following grounds (and may only be held liable on those grounds): (i) fraud, (ii) wrongful interference
with the management of the debtor and (iii) the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are
disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of
which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**Hong Kong**

Two guarantors, Hanesbrands Apparel (Hong Kong) Limited and Hanesbrands Corporate Services (Hong Kong)
Limited, are incorporated in Hong Kong

165


-----

Insolvency proceedings with respect to a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong (a “Hong Kong
Guarantor”) may be commenced in Hong Kong and, if so, will be based on Hong Kong insolvency laws.

In the event of a liquidation of the Hong Kong Guarantor under Hong Kong law, liquidators will realize available
assets (being the assets remaining after secured creditors have enforced on any valid security interests) for the
benefit of the Hong Kong Guarantor’s creditors and contributories. Payments will be made to holders of the notes
(pari with other unsecured creditors) only after payment of all other claims entitled to priority under Hong Kong
insolvency law.

Any interest accruing under or with respect to amounts due under a guarantee provided by the Hong Kong
Guarantor with respect to any period after the commencement of liquidation proceedings would only be
recoverable by the holders of the notes (pari with other creditors) from any surplus remaining after payment of all
other debts proved in the liquidation proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the
commencement of the liquidation proceedings.

Under Hong Kong insolvency law, any payment or other act relating to property made or done by a company
within six months or two years in the event of transactions entered into with an “associate” (as defined in the
Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap. 6 of the laws of Hong Kong)) before the commencement of its winding up is invalid
if the insolvent company in making that payment or doing that act did so with a view to giving a creditor an
unfair preference, which will be presumed if the parties are “associates.” Further, a transaction may be set aside
by the court under Hong Kong law if it amounts to a disposition of property with the “intent to defraud
creditors.” A liquidator, creditor or other person thereby prejudiced may apply to the court for relief.

Under Hong Kong law, a company incorporated in Hong Kong (the “Hong Kong Company”) or any of its
subsidiaries is prohibited from providing “financial assistance” (as defined in section 274 of the Companies
Ordinance (Cap. 622 of the laws of Hong Kong) (the “Companies Ordinance”)) for the acquisition of shares in
the Hong Kong Company or for the purpose of reducing or discharging a liability incurred for the purpose of
such acquisition, unless the transaction falls within the permitted exceptions under the Companies Ordinance or
the giving of the financial assistance is authorized by one of the relevant procedures provided under the
Companies Ordinance.

If the Hong Kong Guarantor’s distributable reserves are less than the value of the notes, the guarantee provided
by the Hong Kong Guarantor may be challenged as an unauthorized distribution to its shareholder.

**Ireland**

One guarantor, Maidenform Brands International Limited, is incorporated in Ireland.

**_Differences in Insolvency Law_**

If an Irish incorporated guarantor has its registered offices in Ireland (an “Irish Guarantor”), there is a rebuttable
presumption that its centre of main interest, for the purposes of any collective proceedings under the EU
Insolvency Regulation, which has force of law in Ireland, is in Ireland and consequently it is likely that main
insolvency proceedings applicable to such company would be governed by Irish law. However, if an Irish
Guarantor has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State of the European Union other than Ireland, then the
main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in such other Member State and will be subject to
the laws of that Member State.

Irish insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of the United States and may make it more difficult for the
holders of the notes to recover the amount in respect of the Irish Guarantor’s guarantee of the notes than they
would have recovered in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

**_Preferential Creditors_**

Under Sections 621 and 622 of the 2014 Act, in a winding-up of an Irish company preferential debts are required
to be paid in priority to all other debts other than those secured by a fixed charge.

The preferential debts will comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain
amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains/property tax, VAT,
PAYE, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salary and wages of employees and
certain contractors and the expenses of liquidations and examinership (should either occur) of the Irish company.

**_Unfair Preference_**

Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have
certain transactions set aside if they are deemed to be an unfair preference. Section 604 of the 2014 Act provides
that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or
done by or against an Irish company, which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor or
any person on trust for any creditor, with a view of giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor for the debt due
to such creditor) a preference over the other creditors within six months (or in the case of a connected person, two
years) of the commencement of a winding-up of the Irish company, shall be invalid. Case law relevant to
Section 286 of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (as amended) (the substantially similar predecessor to Section 604 of
the 2014 Act) indicated that a dominant intent on the part of the entity concerned to prefer a creditor over its other
creditors was necessary in order for Section 286 to apply. Section 604 is only applicable if, at the time of the
conveyance, mortgage or other relevant act, the Irish company was unable to pay its debts as they became due.

**_Improperly Transferred Assets_**

Under Section 608 of the 2014 Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory
of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the relevant Irish Court that any property of such
company was disposed of (which would include by way of transfer, mortgage or security) and the effect of such a
disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or members, the relevant Irish Court may, if it
deems it just and equitable, order any person who appears to have use, control or possession of such property or
the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such
terms as the relevant Irish Court sees fit. Receivers and examiners may similarly challenge the transfer of assets
pursuant to Sections 443 and 557, respectively, of the 2014 Act. Sections 443, 557 and 608 do not apply to a
disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purpose of Section 604 of the 2014 Act.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Sections 615 and 616 of the 2014 Act confer power on a liquidator, with leave of the court, at any time within
twelve months after the commencement of the winding-up or such extended period as may be allowed by the
court, to disclaim any property of the Irish company being wound up which consists of, among other things,
(i) unprofitable contracts or (ii) any property which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding
the possessor to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of money. The liquidator’s hand may be
forced, in that any person interested in the property may require him to decide whether or not he will disclaim
and if the liquidator wishes to disclaim in such circumstances, he must give notice within 28 days or such further
period as may be allowed by the courts that he intends to apply to court to disclaim.

A liquidator must disclaim the whole of the property; he may not keep part and disclaim part. A disclaimer
terminates as and from the date of the disclaimer the rights, interest and liabilities of the company in the contract
or the property, but, the disclaimer does not affect the rights or liabilities of any other person, except so far as
necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability. Any person damaged by the operation of a
disclaimer shall be deemed a creditor of the company to the amount of the damages, and may prove that amount
as a debt in the winding-up.

167


-----

The meaning given to an unprofitable contract is one that would involve the liquidator in some liability. There
must be some “burden” associated with the contract; the mere fact that the insolvent company’s estate would be
better off by disclaimer is not enough.

**_Examinership_**

In addition, a court protection procedure, known as examinership, is available under the 2014 Act to facilitate the
survival of a company and the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern through the appointment of an
examiner to the company and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement. Provided a company can demonstrate viability, and can satisfy certain tests, the High Court or, in certain
circumstances, the Circuit Court (for smaller companies) (each an “Irish Court”) appoints an independent examiner
whose function is to supervise the restructuring process. During the protection period (of up to a maximum of 100
days) he will formulate, in conjunction with the existing stakeholders and potential investors, proposals for a scheme of
arrangement, which are presented to statutory meetings of all members and creditors and ultimately to the relevant
Irish Court for confirmation. The scheme will provide for the treatment of creditors’ claims in the restructuring, the
adjustment of the rights of shareholders, and a structure for the investment underpinning the restructuring. If confirmed
by the relevant Irish Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the
protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the company,
subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the relevant Irish Court.

If an Irish Guarantor is placed in examinership, you may not be able to enforce your rights under its guarantee of
the notes.

The effect of the appointment of an examiner is to suspend the rights of creditors for the protection period. For as
long as a company is under the protection of the relevant Irish Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or
execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent
of the examiner.

No other proceedings in relation to the company may be commenced except by leave of the court and subject to
such terms as it may impose. In addition, no payment may be made by a company during the period when it is
under protection of the court by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or any part of a liability incurred by
the company before the date of presentation of the petition for the appointment of the examiner, unless the report
of the independent accountant contains a recommendation to that effect, or unless the court, on application being
made by the examiner or any interested party, shall so authorize it, if the court is satisfied that a failure to do so
would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as
a going concern.

The 2014 Act provides, inter alia, that no proceedings of any sort may be commenced against a guarantor in
respect of the debts of the Irish company in examinership.

Section 554 of the 2014 Act allows for the remuneration, costs and expenses of the examiner to be paid prior to
any other claims including secured claims (whether secured by fixed or floating security). Section 529 of the
2014 Act provides that any liabilities incurred by a company in examinership which are certified by the examiner
to have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner, the survival of the company under
court protection as a going concern during the period would otherwise be seriously prejudiced, shall be treated as
expenses properly incurred for the purposes of Section 554 and will rank ahead of claims other than the claims of
creditors secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge. Nonetheless, if
the court sanctions borrowings by an examiner as part of the expenses of the examiner pursuant to Section 554,
such borrowings will rank ahead of the claims of both unsecured and secured creditors (whether secured by fixed
or floating security) of the company under court protection.

**_Financial Assistance_**

The notes may only be guaranteed by an Irish Guarantor to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee
constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82 of the 2014 Act.

**_Enforcement Process_**

The guarantee of the notes by an Irish Guarantor may be subject to review under Irish law in the following
circumstances:

- the Irish Guarantor, having become the subject of liquidation proceedings within six months (or two years if
the guarantee is given in favor of anyone who is, in relation to the Irish Guarantor, a connected person) of
issuing the guarantee, is made the subject of an application by the liquidator, on behalf of the Irish
Guarantor, to the Irish courts to void the guarantee on the grounds that the issuance of the guarantee
constituted a preference over other creditors at a time when the Irish Guarantor was insolvent;

- if the Irish Guarantor were wound up, the Irish courts, on the application of a liquidator or creditor, may, if
it can be shown that the guarantee or any payments made thereunder constituted a fraud on the Irish
Guarantor, order a return of payments made by the Irish Guarantor under the guarantee;

- if the guarantee is challenged on the grounds that there was no corporate benefit to the Irish Guarantor in
entering into the guarantee; or

- the Irish Guarantor having become insolvent, or deemed likely to become insolvent, is made the subject of
court protection under the examinership procedure (as discussed more fully above) and the court approves a
scheme for the compromise of debts of the Irish Guarantor.

Under the laws of Ireland, a guarantee may only be issued where the entity issuing the guarantee receives
sufficient commercial benefit for doing so. If there is insufficient commercial benefit, the beneficiary of the
guarantee may not be able to rely on the authority of the directors of that entity to grant the guarantee and
accordingly a court may set aside the guarantee at the request of the entity’s shareholders or a liquidator. In
addition, in an insolvency of an Irish company, the claims of certain preferential creditors (including the Irish
Revenue Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes) will rank in priority to claims of unsecured creditors. If the
Irish Guarantor becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Irish Guarantor has obligations to creditors
that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the holders of the notes, the holders of the
notes may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding.

If a court voided the guarantee or any payment under the guarantee of the notes as a result of a fraudulent transfer or
held it unenforceable for any other reason, the rights of holders of the notes under the guarantee would be undermined
and such holders could cease to have any claim against the Irish Guarantor under its guarantee of the notes.

**The Netherlands**

One guarantor, Hanes Netherlands Holdings B.V. (the “Dutch Guarantor”), is incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor under the notes may be successfully
contested by a Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments or its receiver
(curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of
the company do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association
(doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this
fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of a Dutch company, a court
will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant
circumstances including whether the granting of such security interest is in the company’s corporate interests
(vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting

169


-----

of such security interest. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in a Dutch
company’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

In connection with the removal of the prohibition on financial assistance for Dutch private companies with limited
liability as per 1 October 2012, it was mentioned in Dutch Parliament that the granting of security, providing of a
guarantee or accepting of liability with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares
in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the
further circumstances, constitute ultra vires. At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer
_van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_
company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of € 225,000 or more or such
lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of
at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such
company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued therefor
with a value of € 20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association.
A trade union and other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company may
also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be
upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

Under Dutch law, any creditor of the Dutch Guarantor or its receiver (curator) may nullify any transaction or
legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the
transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted without
prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their
bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of
whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of the issuance of the
notes, or any other transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes was
conducted, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or
should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio
_pauliana). A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent_
debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle
rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions performed
within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain
transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially
exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and
acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same
shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing
requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction
if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the
transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed, or
(ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a
view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any
such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge
would be successful.

In the event that the Dutch Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of
such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of
the Dutch Guarantor.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act
(Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions

170


-----

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Dutch Guarantor has its “center
of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands”, it may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings
governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions as provided for in the EU Insolvency
Regulation (no. 1346/2000/EC).

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law: (a) suspension of payments (surseance
_van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to_
continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and
distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly used insolvency regime and may
result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going concern. A suspension of payments almost always results
in the debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet).

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately
(dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders).
A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it will generally be
granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims
held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the
debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor
will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments will only affect unsecured,
non-preferential creditors.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the
creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar
_Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar_
_belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed_
to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain
creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured
creditors, will benefit from special rights.

Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of
payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security
interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months extendable by
another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to articles 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet); (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a
reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing
which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party
after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s
receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings
against the Dutch Guarantor would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also
preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against
the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a
statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be

171


-----

declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured
creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the
distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among
the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will in principle be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination will be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, the actual effect depends largely
on the way such subordination is construed. In exceptional circumstances, a compulsory plan of composition may
limit the contractual subordination.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be
respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of
execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two
months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security
interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured
assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the
secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any
enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the
secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to
clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension
of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all
attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become
definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be)
subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the
bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a
simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting,
representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or
inhibit the ability of the holders of the notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of
notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a
suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be
entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law
means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is
determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for
verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and
whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of
bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim
validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while
in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These
procedures could cause holders of notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they
could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders
of notes to be delayed. Interest on the notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless
secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an
interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission.
No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

**Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments**

The Issuer is a company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Certain guarantors are organized under the
laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands. The indenture (including the guarantees) and the notes will be governed by New York law.

Some of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the guarantors are non-residents of the
United States. Since some of the assets of the Issuer and each of the non-U.S. guarantors, and its and their
directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any monies owed under a judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a non-U.S. guarantor or any such other non-U.S. resident
person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the notes
or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States.

Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the non-U.S. guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process
in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any
action in relation to the notes and the indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors
to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any
action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, whilst such
appointments are effective. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions
upon those persons, the Issuer or the non-U.S. guarantors provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on
the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15,
1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a non-U.S. guarantor or any of their directors or
executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant defendant has
assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for
certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, you should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed
to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Luxembourg**

The United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and
commercial matters. A valid, final and conclusive judgment rendered by a U.S. court against a Luxembourg
Obligor with respect to the notes needs to obtain an exequatur by a Luxembourg District Court (Tribunal
_d’arrondissement) before it can be enforced by a bailiff. The Luxembourg ordinary law principles (droit_
_commun), that will be applicable to grant an exequatur of such U.S. court order, have been determined by case_
law on the basis of articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de
_Procédure Civile). The following conditions must be met:_

    - the U.S. court must have had proper jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, both according to its
own rules on territorial and personal jurisdiction and to the Luxembourg international private law
conflict of jurisdiction rules;

    - the U.S. court must have applied the law which is designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules
or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules. Based on recent case
law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be
granted by a Luxembourg court;

    - the decision of the foreign court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which it was
rendered;

174


-----

    - the U.S. court must have applied the proper law to the matter submitted to it and the foreign procedure
must have been regular in light of the laws of the country of origin;

    - the decision of the U.S. court must not have been obtained by fraud, but in compliance with the rights
of the defendant and in compliance with its own procedural laws; and

    - the decisions and the considerations of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg international
public policy rules or have been given in proceedings of a tax or criminal nature or rendered
subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi). It cannot be excluded that awards of
damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, which
are classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or
punitive damages, would not be recognized by Luxembourg courts). Ordinarily an award of monetary
damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages
such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules, Luxembourg
courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made bona fide, (ii) if
the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to
mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the
requisite power to grant the remedies sought. While, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a
Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a
Luxembourg court would have power to give a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro,
enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such
purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

The courts of the British Virgin Islands will not necessarily enter judgments in original actions brought in courts
predicated on U.S. federal or state securities laws. Additionally, there is no statutory enforcement in the British
Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States; however, the courts of the British Virgin Islands will
in certain circumstances recognize such a foreign judgment and treat it as a cause of action in itself, which may
be sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary, provided that:

- the U.S. court issuing the judgment had jurisdiction in the matter and the company subject to the judgment
either submitted to such jurisdiction or was resident or carrying on business within such jurisdiction and was
duly served with process;

- the judgment given by the U.S. court is final and for a liquidated sum and has not been wholly satisfied;

- the judgment given by the U.S. court was not in respect of penalties, taxes, fines or similar fiscal or revenue
obligations of the company subject to the judgment;

- in obtaining judgment there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was given or on
the part of the court;

- recognition or enforcement of the judgment in the British Virgin Islands would not be contrary to public
policy or for some other similar reason; and

- the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice.

-----

In appropriate circumstances, the British Virgin Islands court may give effect in the British Virgin Islands to other
kinds of final US judgments such as declaratory orders, orders for performance of contracts and injunctions. The
above will also apply to the enforcement of judgments obtained in most other foreign courts outside the British
Virgin Islands, except for judgments obtained in the High Court of England and Wales and those certain other
jurisdictions, which enjoy the British Virgin Islands statutory enforcement regime as set forth below.

**_Enforcement of Judgments of High Court of England and Wales and Certain Other Jurisdictions_**

Any final and conclusive monetary judgment obtained against a person in the High Court of England and Wales
or in the courts of Scotland, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, St Vincent, Jamaica, Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Bahamas,
Bermuda, Trinidad & Tobago, St Lucia, Grenada and New South Wales (Australia) for a definite sum may be
registered and enforced as a judgment of the British Virgin Islands court pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement
of Judgments Act 1922, provided that (i) application is made for registration of the judgment within twelve
months of its date or such longer period as the British Virgin Islands court may allow, (ii) the person against
whom judgment was obtained is not appealing or does not have the right or intention to appeal and (iii) the
British Virgin Islands court considers it just and convenient that the judgment be so enforced.

If not registered, the judgment may be treated as a debt upon which the foreign judgment debtor may bring an
action so that no retrial of the underlying issues giving rise to the original judgment would be necessary. In that
case, it would be necessary that the judgment (not being in respect of penalties, fines, taxes or similar fiscal or
revenue obligations of the company in question) (i) is final, for a liquidated sum, (ii) was not obtained in a
fraudulent manner, (iii) is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy in the British
Virgin Islands or for some other similar reason, (iv) is not contrary to the principles of natural justice.
Furthermore, it would be necessary that the relevant courts had jurisdiction in the matter and the person against
whom it was obtained either submitted to such jurisdiction, was resident or carrying on business within such
jurisdiction, and was duly served with process. In appropriate circumstances, a British Virgin Islands court may
give effect in the British Virgin Islands to other kinds of final foreign judgments, such as declaratory orders,
orders for performance of contracts and injunctions.

**Cayman Islands**

The United States and the Cayman Islands do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Although there is no statutory enforcement in the
Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in New York or other states in the United States, a judgment obtained in
such jurisdictions may be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without
any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment
debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment: (i) is final and conclusive, (ii) is one in
respect of which the foreign court had jurisdiction over the defendant according to Cayman Islands conflict of
law rules, (iii) is either for a liquidated sum not in respect of penalties or taxes or a fine or similar fiscal or
revenue obligations and (iv) was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is
contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands. There is doubt, however, as to whether the
courts of the Cayman Islands will:

(i) recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws
of the United States or any state thereof; or

(ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, impose liabilities upon the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof,

in each case, on the grounds that such provisions are penal in nature.

A Cayman Islands court may also stay local proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

**France**

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
entitlements in connection with the notes against a French entity and/or a French person.

The Issuer has been advised by its French legal advisers, that the United States and France are not parties to a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards,
rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. Federal or State court
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal or State securities laws, enforceable in
the United States, would not directly be recognised or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favour such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France
before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied
that the following cumulative conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the
foreign judgment):

- such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it;

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (for example, there was no international forum shopping),
the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case including particularly fair trial rights;

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law; and

- such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a Foreign judgment which has become
effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time of enforcement of
the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions, i.e.
those having a res judicata effect, can benefit from an exequatur under French law.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment is likely to benefit from the
_res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and is thus likely to be declared_
enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French order No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents
and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or
persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from any French person in connection
with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to
comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) and French
procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or a French person.

Similarly, French data protection rules (French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files
and individual liberties, as most recently modified by French law No. 2016-41 of January 26, 2016 and French
order No. 2016-462 dated April 14, 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining
information in France or from a French person in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a
discovery context.

177


-----

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply provisions of Foreign law as
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict or as chosen by the parties to govern their contract if the
application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined
on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. Federal or
State securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the sought remedies

Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual)
can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by
the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French
national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against his or her will to appear before a jurisdiction
other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French
nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that
has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French
national may waive his or her rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil
Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held on September 26, 2012 (decision No. 11-26.022) that a
contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the
discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was discretionary
(potestative). Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the
party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before
the French courts. This ruling does not apply to choice of courts provisions designating arbitration tribunals.

**Hong Kong**

Generally, a U.S. court judgment may be enforced in the Hong Kong courts, provided that it:

- is not barred from enforcement by or in breach of the provisions of the Foreign Judgments (Restriction on
Recognition and Enforcement) Ordinance (Cap. 46 of the laws of Hong Kong);

- requires the defendant to pay a definite sum of money (other than a sum payable in respect of taxes or
penalties) to the plaintiff;

- is under common law principles recognized by the Hong Kong courts including (without limitation) the
requirement that the judgment be final and conclusive on the merits;

- was not obtained by fraud, misrepresentation or mistake or obtained in proceedings which contravene the
rules of natural justice under Hong Kong law;

- is not contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong (as currently applied by the courts of Hong Kong);

- is in relation to commercial transactions in which the plaintiff has acted in a private or commercial capacity;

- is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction (as determined by Hong Kong jurisdictional rules);

- is not impeachable according to the rules on conflict of laws in Hong Kong; and

- is enforced within six years after the date of the judgment.

The above list is not exhaustive and additional factors may be relevant from case to case. Further, there is doubt
as to the enforceability in Hong Kong of U.S. court judgments predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws. This doubt reflects the possibility that a claim could be made predicated on U.S. federal or state
securities laws which on enforcement proceedings would be characterized as a direct or indirect sanction of the
U.S. state and therefore penal in nature.

178


-----

**Ireland**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Ireland and substantially all of the assets of the said
Guarantor may be located outside the United States. Although said Guarantor has appointed an agent for service
of process in the United States, said Guarantor and the Issuer have been advised that it may not be possible to
enforce court judgments obtained in the United States in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the
U.S. federal or state securities laws. Said Guarantor and the Issuer have also been advised that there is some
uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts based on the
civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions based on those laws.

We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether
or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.

A judgment of the U.S. courts will be enforced by the Irish courts if the following general requirements are met:
(i) the procedural rules of the U.S. court must have been observed and the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction in
relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the
defendant would satisfy this rule); and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final
and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to
appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to
stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland.
It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.

However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the U.S. courts which meets the above
requirements for one of the following reasons: (a) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (b) if the
judgment was obtained by fraud; (c) if the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or
constitutional justice; (d) if the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain United States laws
which will not be enforced in Ireland; or (e) if jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the
judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order
11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

**Netherlands**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law and has its registered seat in the Netherlands. None of the
directors of the Dutch Guarantor reside in the United States and a substantial amount of the Dutch Guarantors
assets are located outside of the United States. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States
may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment
obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable
in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under
current practice, generally grant the same judgment without re-litigation on the merits (i) if that judgment results
from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (ii) if that judgment does not contravene
public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) if the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or state court in
the United States has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law and (iv) the
judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court,
or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns
the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in
the Netherlands.

179


-----

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state
courts in the Netherlands. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Listing and General Information**

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for the notes to be listed on the Official List and to
be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules of
that exchange. There are no assurances that the notes will be admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer may choose to apply to list the
notes on another recognized stock exchange or may, at any time, upon the good faith determination of the parent
guarantor’s senior management that the ongoing reporting requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange are
overly burdensome (including, for the avoidance of doubt, more burdensome than the parent guarantor’s
reporting requirements under the Exchange Act) to the Issuer, determine that it will not maintain such listing and
may instead seek to obtain a listing of such notes on another recognized stock exchange. Nothing in this offering
memorandum shall obligate the Issuer to list the notes, and there can be no assurance that an application to list
the notes will be approved. Settlement of the notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

So long as the notes are listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on
the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will make
available the notices to the public in written form at places indicated by announcements to be published in a
leading newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort)
or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, www.bourse.lu, or by other means considered equivalent
by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

For so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading
on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market and the rules of that exchange require, copies of the
following documents (together with English translations thereof) may be inspected and obtained free of charge
by noteholders at the specified office of the listing agent in Luxembourg during normal business hours on any
weekday:

    - the organizational documents in English of the Issuer, the Parent and the other guarantors;

    - the indenture (which includes the form of the notes and the guarantee); and

    - the Issuer’s most recent annual financial statements and any interim consolidated financial statements
published by it.

We will maintain a paying agent in London for as long as any of the Notes are listed on the official list of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market.
We reserve the right to vary such appointment.

The issuance of the notes was authorized by the Issuer on May 16, 2016 in accordance with the resolutions
validly adopted by issuer’s general partner, Hanesbrands GP Luxembourg S.à r.l.

Except as disclosed in this offering memorandum:

    - there has been no material adverse change in our financial position since January 2, 2016; and

    - we have not been involved in any litigation, administrative proceeding or arbitration relating to claims
or amounts, which are material in the context of the issue of the notes, and, so far as we are aware, no
such litigation, administrative proceeding or arbitration is pending or threatened.

**Hanesbrands Inc.**

**Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

Management of Hanesbrands Inc. (“Hanesbrands”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Hanesbrands’ system of internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Hanesbrands; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that
receipts and expenditures of Hanesbrands are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of Hanesbrands; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Hanesbrands’ assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

The Company excluded its wholly owned subsidiary, Knights Holdco, Inc. (“Knights Apparel”) from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016 because its control over this
operation was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2015. The total assets and
total revenues of Knights Apparel represented 5% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 2, 2016.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of Hanesbrands’ internal control over financial reporting as of
January 2, 2016, based upon criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal
_Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway_
Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation, management determined that Hanesbrands’ internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of January 2, 2016.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which
is included on the following page.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hanesbrands Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Hanesbrands Inc. (the “Company”) at January 2, 2016 and January 3,
2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2,
2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 2, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in the Report of Management on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded Knights Apparel from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016,
because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2015. We have also
excluded Knights Apparel from our audit of internal controls over financial reporting. Knights Apparel is a
wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 5% and 3%, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 2, 2016.

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**
**Years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013**
**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

**(1)** **Basis of Presentation**

Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), is a consumer goods company with a portfolio
of leading apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Bali, Playtex, Maidenform, DIM, JMS/Just My Size,
_L’eggs, Nur Die/Nur Der, Wonderbra, Gear for Sports, Lilyette, Lovable, Rinbros, Shock Absorber, Track N_
_Field, Abanderado and Zorba. The Company designs, manufactures, sources and sells a broad range of basic_
apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, activewear, socks and hosiery.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All references to “2015”, “2014”
and “2013” relate to the 52 week fiscal year ended on January 2, 2016, the 53 week fiscal year ended on
January 3, 2015 and the 52 week fiscal year ended on December 28, 2013, respectively. A significant subsidiary
of the Company, DBA Lux Holding S.A. (“Hanes Europe Innerwear”), had a 53 week fiscal year ended
January 2, 2016 as a result of aligning Hanes Europe Innerwear’s year end with the Company in the year after
acquisition. The 53rd week of financial information for Hanes Europe Innerwear did not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**(2)** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_(a) Consolidation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**_(b) Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, certain financial statement disclosures at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from these
estimates.

**_(c) Foreign Currency Translation_**

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates
existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange
rates are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) within
stockholders’ equity. The Company translates the results of operations of its foreign operations at the average
exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

**_(d) Sales Recognition and Incentives_**

The Company recognizes revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales
price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and
(iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment. The Company
records a sales reduction for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience. The Company earns
royalty revenues through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate
certain of the Company’s brands. The Company accrues revenue earned under these contracts based upon

reported sales from the licensee. The Company offers a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers of
its products, and the policies regarding the recognition and display of these incentives within the Consolidated
Statements of Income are as follows:

_Discounts, Coupons, and Rebates_

The Company recognizes the cost of these incentives at the later of the date at which the related sale is
recognized or the date at which the incentive is offered. The cost of these incentives is estimated using a number
of factors, including historical utilization and redemption rates. All cash incentives of this type are included in
the determination of net sales. The Company includes incentives offered in the form of free products in the
determination of cost of sales.

_Volume-Based Incentives_

These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash that are redeemable only if the reseller
completes a specified number of sales transactions. Under these incentive programs, the Company estimates the
anticipated rebate to be paid and allocates a portion of the estimated cost of the rebate to each underlying sales
transaction with the customer. The Company includes these amounts in the determination of net sales.

_Cooperative Advertising_

Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred
by the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products. The Company recognizes the cost of
cooperative advertising programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional activity first takes place.

_Fixtures and Racks_

Store fixtures and racks are periodically used by resellers to display Company products. The Company
expenses the cost of these fixtures and racks in the period in which they are delivered to the resellers. The
Company includes the costs of fixtures and racks incurred by resellers and charged back to the Company in the
determination of net sales. Fixtures and racks purchased by the Company and provided to resellers are included
in selling, general and administrative expenses.

**_(e) Advertising Expense_**

Advertising costs, which include the development and production of advertising materials and the
communication of these materials through various forms of media, are expensed in the period the advertising first
takes place. The Company recognized advertising expense in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses”
caption in the Consolidated Statements of Income of $181,956, $183,333 and $161,541 in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

**_(f) Shipping and Handling Costs_**

Revenue received for shipping and handling costs is included in net sales and was $19,710, $22,903 and
$25,423 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Shipping costs, which comprise payments to third party shippers,
and handling costs, which consist of warehousing costs in the Company’s various distribution facilities, were
$332,678, $295,280 and $241,026 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company recognizes shipping,
handling and distribution costs in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

**Years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013**
**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

**_(g) Catalog Expenses_**

The Company incurs expenses for printing catalogs for products to aid in the Company’s sales efforts. The
Company initially records these expenses as a prepaid item and charges it against selling, general and
administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used. Expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates
historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog distribution.

**_(h) Research and Development_**

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Research and development includes
expenditures for new product, technological improvements for existing products and process innovation, which
primarily consist of salaries, consulting and supplies attributable to time spent on research and development
activities. Additional costs include depreciation and maintenance for research and development equipment and
facilities. Research and development expense was $62,324, $63,268 and $51,316 in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

**_(i) Defined Contribution Benefit Plans_**

The Company sponsors 401(k) plans as well as other defined contribution benefit plans. Expense for these
plans was $21,972, $22,898 and $23,489 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

**_(j) Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are
considered to be cash equivalents.

**_(k) Accounts Receivable Valuation_**

Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the
Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis
of historical experience, aging of trade receivables, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
currently available information.

**_(l) Inventory Valuation_**

Inventories are stated at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, or
“FIFO,” method for inventories. Obsolete, damaged, and excess inventory is carried at the net realizable value,
which is determined by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and future marketing and
sales plans. Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory
purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost
of sales when the related inventory item is sold.

**_(m) Property_**

Property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three
to 15 years and buildings and building improvements over periods of up to 40 years. A change in the depreciable

**HANESBRANDS INC.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)**
**Years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013**
**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of
change and future periods. Additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life of a particular
asset and interest costs incurred during the construction period of major properties are capitalized. Repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of an asset, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying
value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate, several
periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. Recoverability of property is evaluated by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair
value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amount of
those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss
is not permitted under U.S. GAAP.

**_(n) Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets_**

The primary identifiable intangible assets of the Company are trademarks, license agreements, customer and
distributor relationships and computer software. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized and
those with indefinite lives are not amortized. The estimated useful life of a finite-lived intangible asset is based
upon a number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution
channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. Trademarks with finite
lives are being amortized over periods ranging from seven to 30 years, license agreements are being amortized
over periods ranging from three to 17 years, customer and distributor relationships are being amortized over
periods ranging from two to 15 years and computer software and other intangibles are being amortized over
periods ranging from one to seven years.

Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process
similar to that used in evaluating elements of property. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization
are assessed for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and as triggering
events occur. The impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of
comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value
of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. In assessing fair value,
management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results,
business plans and present value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates
and the cost of capital at a point in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs, which include the actual costs to purchase
software from vendors and generally include personnel and related costs for employees who were directly
associated with the enhancement and implementation of purchased computer software. Additions to computer
software are included in purchases of property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

**_(o) Goodwill_**

Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination. When a business combination is completed, the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the Company given responsibility for
managing, controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities. In many instances, all of the acquired
assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is
assigned to the same reporting unit. In those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to
more than one reporting unit, the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar
to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.

Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events
occur. The Company’s annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. In evaluating the
recoverability of goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the
carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the next step of the process
involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the
carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. No impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the
testing conducted in 2015. In estimating the fair values of the reporting units, management relies on a number of
factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results, business plans and present value
techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point
in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to
the analysis of goodwill impairment.

**_(p) Insurance Reserves_**

The Company is self-insured for property, workers’ compensation, medical and other casualty programs up
to certain stop-loss limits. Undiscounted liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of
the expected aggregate losses below those limits and are based on a number of assumptions, including historical
trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions.

**_(q) Stock-Based Compensation_**

The Company established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated), (the
“Omnibus Incentive Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to its employees, non-employee directors and employees
of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent performance and retention of employees.
The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments
based upon the grant date fair value of those awards.

**_(r) Income Taxes_**

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and
income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Given
continuing losses in certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates on a separate return basis, a valuation
allowance has been established for the deferred tax assets in these specific locations. The Company periodically
estimates the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgment.

**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the
Company transacts business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the
outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations. Income tax expense is
adjusted in the period in which these events occur, and these adjustments are included in the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Income. If such changes take place, there is a risk that the Company’s effective tax
rate may increase or decrease in any period. A company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate resolution.

**_(s) Financial Instruments_**

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign
exchange rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the Company’s exposure to these risks with the
goal of reducing the risk or cost to the Company. Depending on the nature of the underlying risk being hedged,
these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in
the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The Company does
not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contracts.

On the date the derivative is entered into, the Company determines whether the derivative meets the criteria
for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or whether the financial instrument is serving as an economic hedge
against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore is not designated as a hedge for accounting
purposes. The accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative
has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship.

The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedging instruments
and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge
transaction. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets, liabilities,
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at inception and at least
quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective
hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting,
and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified as current or
noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The fair value is based upon either market quotes for
actively traded instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments. Cash flows hedges are
classified in the same category as the item being hedged, and cash flows from derivative contracts not designated
as hedges are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by individual counterparties
or the entire group of counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts. Risk of nonperformance by
counterparties is mitigated by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by diversifying across counterparties.

**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

_Cash Flow Hedges_

The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is
recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the
hedged item affects the income statement, the gain or loss included in AOCI is reported on the same line in the
Consolidated Statements of Income as the hedged item. In addition, both the fair value of changes excluded from
the Company’s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of
derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

_Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges_

For derivative contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are reported in the “Selling, general
and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts are recorded at fair
value when the hedged item is recorded as an asset or liability and then are revalued each accounting period.

**_(t) Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method, which requires the Company to
allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values
at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes the excess of an acquired business’ cost over the fair value of
acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill.

Fair values are determined using the income approach based on market participant assumptions focusing on
future cash flow projections and accepted industry standards.

**_(u) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**

**_Discontinued Operations_**

In April 2014, the FASB issued new accounting rules related to updating the criteria for reporting
discontinued operations and enhancing related disclosures requirements. The new rules were effective for the
Company in the first quarter of 2015. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material effect on
the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Extraordinary and Unusual Items_**

In January 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules that remove the concept of extraordinary items
from U.S. GAAP. Under the existing guidance, an entity is required to separately disclose extraordinary items,
net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is of an
unusual nature and occurs infrequently. This separate, net-of-tax presentation (and corresponding earnings per
share impact) will no longer be allowed. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of
2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Consolidation_**

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update to their existing consolidation model, which changes the
analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)**

**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the
adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

**_Debt Issuance Costs_**

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The new rules will be effective for the
Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to
have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Cloud Computing_**

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, related to a customer’s accounting for fees paid in a
cloud computing arrangement. The guidance provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license
consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement
should be accounted for as a service contract. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first
quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Fair Value Measurement_**

In May 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to fair value measurements.
The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair
value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and requires separate disclosure of
those investments instead. These disclosures will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The
new accounting rules will not have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows but will result in certain additional disclosures.

**_Revenue from Contracts with Customers_**

In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay effective dates for the new accounting rules related to revenue
recognition for contracts with customers by one year. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the
first quarter of 2018 with retrospective application required. The Company is currently in the process of
evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_Inventory_**

In July 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require inventory to be recorded at the lower of
cost or net realizable value. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The
Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Measurement Period Adjustments_**

In September 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which simplify the accounting for measurement
period adjustments by eliminating the requirements to restate prior period financial statements for these

**Years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013**

adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment
(including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is
identified. The new standard, which should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that
occur after the effective date, is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not
expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

**_Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes_**

In November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, intended to improve how deferred taxes are
classified on organizations’ balance sheets. The new guidance eliminates the current requirement for
organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
Instead, organizations will now be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The
new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017, and may be applied retrospectively or
prospectively. The Company has elected to adopt the standard early, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, and
will apply the standard retrospectively. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_(v) Reclassifications_**

Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, none of which are material, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
These classifications within the statements had no impact on the Company’s results of operations.

**(3)** **Acquisitions**

**_Knights Apparel Acquisition_**

In April 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Knights Holdco, Inc. (“Knights Apparel”), a
leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel, from Merit Capital Partners
in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $192,888 on an enterprise value basis. The Company funded
the acquisition with cash on hand and short-term borrowings under its Revolving Loan Facility.

The Knights Apparel and Pro Edge trademarks and brand names, which management believes to have
indefinite lives, have been valued at $12,000. Amortizable intangible assets have been assigned values of
$31,200 for license agreements, $14,500 for distribution networks, and $2,250 for non-compete agreements.
License agreements are being amortized over 14 years. Distributor relationships are being amortized over 12
years. Non-compete agreements are being amortized over one year.

Knights Apparel contributed net revenues of approximately $160,248 and $27,096 of pretax earnings since
the date of acquisition. The results of Knights Apparel have been included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition and are reported as part of the Activewear segment.

Factors that contribute to the amount of goodwill recognized for the acquisition include the value of the
existing work force and cost savings by utilizing the Company’s low-cost supply chain and expected synergies
with existing Company functions. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is not tax deductible.

The allocation of purchase price is preliminary and subject to change. The primary areas of the purchase
price that are not yet finalized are related to certain income taxes and residual goodwill. Accordingly,
adjustments will be made to the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as additional information is
obtained about the facts and circumstances, which existed at the valuation date. The acquired assets and assumed
liabilities at the date of acquisition (April 6, 2015) include the following:

Cash and cash equivalents $ 59

will create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased scale to serve retailers. Hanes Europe Innerwear
utilizes a mix of self-owned manufacturing and third-party manufacturers. Factors that contribute to the amount
of goodwill recognized for the acquisition include the value of the existing work force and cost savings by
utilizing the Company’s low-cost supply chain and expected synergies with existing Company functions.
Goodwill associated with the acquisition is not tax deductible.

The purchase price allocation was finalized in the third quarter 2015.

In connection with the Hanes Europe Innerwear acquisition, the Company acquired certain time deposits
with maturity dates beyond three months. These investments were reported in the “Other current assets” line on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at acquisition date. Since the acquisition, the Company liquidated these
investments for $64,380 and reported the proceeds as investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

Since August 2014, goodwill increased by $2,807 in 2015 as a result of measurement period adjustments to
the acquired income tax balances and increased by $7,453 in 2014 for additional working capital payments made.

In 2014, Hanes Europe Innerwear contributed net revenues of $291,208 and pretax earnings of $24,075.

**_Maidenform Acquisition_**

In October 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Maidenform Brands, Inc.
(“Maidenform”) at $23.50 per share for a total purchase price of $580,505. The acquisition was financed through
a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowing on the Company’s revolving credit facility. In 2013,
Maidenform contributed net revenues of $98,400 and pretax earnings of $827 (excluding acquisition and
integration related charges of $73,798). The purchase price allocation was finalized in the third quarter 2014.

**(4)** **Earnings Per Share**

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) was computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS was calculated to give effect to all
potentially dilutive shares of common stock using the treasury stock method. On March 3, 2015, the Company
implemented a four-for-one stock split on the Company’s common stock in the form of a 300% stock dividend.
All references to the number of shares outstanding, per share amounts and share options data of the Company’s
common shares have been restated to reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.

The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows:

**Years Ended**


**January 2,**

**January 3,**
**2015**


**December 28,**
**2013**


Basic weighted average shares outstanding 399,891 402,300 399,436
Effect of potentially dilutive securities:
Stock options 2,719 4,452 6,144
Restricted stock units 1,009 1,292 1,708
Employee stock purchase plan and other 40 — 4

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 403,659 408,044 407,292

Restricted stock units totaling 348, 376 and 824 units were excluded from the diluted earnings per share
calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In 2015, 2014 and
2013, there were no anti-dilutive options to purchase shares of common stock.

**(5)** **Stock-Based Compensation**

The Company established the Omnibus Incentive Plan to award stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to its employees, nonemployee directors and employees of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent
performance and retention of employees.

_Stock Options_

The exercise price of each stock option equals the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date
of grant. Options granted vest ratably over three years and can be exercised over a term of 10 years. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. There
were no options granted during any of the periods presented.

A summary of the changes in stock options outstanding to the Company’s employees under the Omnibus
Incentive Plan is presented below:

Options outstanding and exercisable at January 2, 2016 2,752 $5.62 $ 65,531 2.88

The total intrinsic value of options that were exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $105,899, $86,843
and $95,380 respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise of the share-based payment
arrangements totaled $118,682, $70,196 and $56,679 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

**_Stock Unit Awards_**

Restricted stock units (RSUs) of the Company’s stock are granted to certain Company non-employee
directors and employees to incent performance and retention over periods of one to three years, respectively.
Upon vesting, the RSUs are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis and
issued to the grantees. Some RSUs which have been granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan vest upon
continued future service to the Company, while others also have a performance-based vesting feature. The cost of
these awards is determined using the fair value of the shares on the date of grant, and compensation expense is

Nonvested share units outstanding at January 2, 2016 2,833 $23.99 $83,381 1.78

The total fair value of shares vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $20,784, $17,831 and $16,933,
respectively. Certain participants elected to defer receipt of shares earned upon vesting.

In addition to granting RSUs that vest solely upon continued future service to the Company, the Company
also grants performanced-based restricted stock units where the number of shares of the Company’s common
stock that will be received upon vesting range from 0% to 200% of the number of units granted based on the
Company’s achievement of certain performance metrics. These performanced-based stock awards, which are
included in the table above, represent awards that are earned based on future performance and service. As
reported in the above table, the number of performanced-based restricted stock units granted each year represents
the initial units granted on the date of grant plus any additional units that were earned based on the final
achievement of the respective performance thresholds.

For all share-based payments under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company
recognized total compensation expense of $29,154, $30,230 and $23,845 and recognized a deferred tax benefit of
$11,382, $11,757 and $11,045, respectively.

At January 2, 2016, there was $11,108 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stockbased compensation arrangements, of which $7,828, $2,457, and $823 is expected to be recognized in 2016,
2017, and 2018, respectively. The Company satisfies the requirement for common shares for share-based
payments to employees pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan by issuing newly authorized shares. The

Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the “Selling, general and administrative
expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are
primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deductions
and write-offs, which do not increase or decrease income, represent write-offs of previously reserved accounts
receivable and allowed customer chargebacks and deductions against gross accounts receivable.

**_Sales of Accounts Receivable_**

The Company has entered into agreements to sell selected trade accounts receivable to financial institutions.
After the sale, the Company does not retain any interests in the receivables and the applicable financial institution
services and collects these accounts receivable directly from the customer. Net proceeds of these accounts
receivable sale programs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as part of operating cash
flows. The Company recognized funding fees of $2,452, $2,599 and $2,636 in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, for sales of accounts receivable to financial institutions in the “Other expenses” line in the

respectively.

**_Senior Secured Credit Facility_**

On April 29, 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit
Facility”) to extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”) to April 2020
and reduce the maximum borrowing capacity from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, re-price the Revolving Loan
Facility at favorable rates, and add an additional $850,000 in term loan borrowings ($425,000 for a new Term
Loan A and $425,000 for a new Term Loan B. The Company incurred $10,900 in fees related to this refinancing.
The proceeds of the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B were used to refinance existing revolving borrowings
under the prior senior secured credit facility, pay fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the Senior
Secured Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility are used for
general corporate purposes and working capital needs. On October 23, 2015, the Company amended the Senior
Secured Credit Facility to increase the principal amount of the Term Loan A by an additional $300,000. The
Company incurred $1,603 in fees related to this refinancing.

In July 2014, the Company amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility to increase the
committed aggregate facility size to $1,600,000 (from $1,100,000), consisting of (a) Revolving Loan Facility,
and (b) the Euro Term Loan. The Euro Term Loan accrues interest utilizing the EURIBOR rate (as defined in the

Senior Secured Credit Facility) plus 2.75%. The proceeds of the Euro Term Loan are denominated in Euros and
were utilized in part to purchase Hanes Europe Innerwear. Proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility are used for
general corporate purposes and working capital needs. All borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be
repaid in full upon maturity. Outstanding borrowings under the Euro Term Loan are repayable in quarterly
payments of 0.25% of the original borrowings, with the remainder of the outstanding principle due at maturity.

All borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity.

Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A are repayable in equal quarterly installments in the
following annual percentages, with the remainder of the outstanding principal to be repaid at maturity: year one,
5.0%; year two, 7.5%; years three and four, 10.0%; and year five, 15.0%.

Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B are repayable in 0.25% quarterly installments, with the
remainder of the outstanding principal to be repaid at maturity. If the Term Loan B is repriced or refinanced on
or prior to the twelve month anniversary of its funding and as a result of such repricing or refinancing the
effective interest rate of the Term Loan B decreases, the Company shall be required to pay a prepayment fee
equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B subject to such repricing or refinancing.

A portion of the Revolving Loan Facility is available for the issuances of letters of credit and the making of
swingline loans, and any such issuance of letters of credit or making of a swingline loan will reduce the amount
available under the Revolving Loan Facility. At the Company’s option, it may add one or more term loan
facilities or increase the commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility so long as certain conditions are
satisfied, including, among others, that no default or event of default is in existence, that the Company is in pro
forma compliance with the financial covenants described below and that the Company’s senior secured leverage
ratio is less than 3.00 to 1 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness. As of
January 2, 2016, the Company had $15,683 of standby and trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under the
Revolving Loan Facility and $920,817 of borrowing availability.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future
direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries
and certain other subsidiaries. The Company and each of the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility
have granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility a valid and perfected first priority (subject to
certain customary exceptions) lien and security interest in the following:

    - the equity interests of substantially all of the Company’s direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries (other
than U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by foreign subsidiaries) and 65% of the voting
securities of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries; and

    - substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of the
Company and each guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of
such property and assets.

Additionally, the Euro Term Loan is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiary MFB
International Holdings S.à r.l.’s (“MFB International Holdings”) existing and future direct and indirect
subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for certain subsidiaries and secured by a pledge
of 100% of the equity interests of MFB International Holdings and its direct subsidiaries, 100% of the equity
interests owned by any subsidiary of MFB International Holdings that is domiciled in Luxembourg and
substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of each
Luxembourg domiciled guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of such

The Term Loan A, the Term Loan B and the Company’s Euro Term Loan require the Company and its
subsidiary Maidenform Luxembourg (“MF Lux”), as applicable, to prepay any outstanding Term Loans in
connection with (i) the incurrence of certain indebtedness and (ii) non-ordinary course asset sales or other
dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds in any period of
twelve-consecutive months, with customary reinvestment provisions. The Term Loan B and the Euro Term Loan
also require the Company and MF Lux, as applicable, to prepay any outstanding Term Loans under the Term
Loan B and the Euro Term Loan in connection with excess cash flow, which percentage will be based upon the
Company’s leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. All such prepayments will be made on a pro rata
basis under each of the applicable Term Loans that are subject to such prepayments.

At the Company’s option, borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility, the Term Loan A and the Term
Loan B bear interest based on the LIBOR rate or the “base rate” plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The
applicable margin for the Revolving Loan Facility and the Term Loan A is determined by reference to a
leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, ranging from a maximum of 2.00% in
the case of LIBOR-based loans and 1.00% in the case of Base Rate loans if the Company’s leverage ratio is
greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1, and will step down in 0.25% increments to a minimum of 1.25% in the case of
LIBOR-based loans and 0.25% in the case of Base Rate loans if the Company’s leverage ratio is less than 2.50 to
1. The applicable margin under the Term Loan B is 2.50% in the case of LIBOR-based loans and 1.50% in the
case of Base Rate loans.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with customary affirmative, negative
and financial covenants. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a minimum
interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes, depreciation
expense and amortization, as computed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility), or leverage ratio. The
interest coverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal
quarters to its consolidated total interest expense for such period shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal
quarter. The leverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s total debt to EBITDA for the
preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more than 4.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter provided that, following a
permitted acquisition in which the consideration is at least $200,000, such maximum leverage ratio covenant
shall be increased to 4.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending in the succeeding 12-month period following such
permitted acquisition. The method of calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included in the
Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In addition, the commitment fee for the unused portion of revolving loan commitments made by the Lenders
is between 25 and 35 basis points based on the applicable commitment fee margin in effect from time to time.
When the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility) is greater than or equal to 4.00 to
1.00, the commitment fee margin is 0.350%. When the Leverage Ratio is less than 4.00 to 1.00 but greater than
or equal to 3.25 to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee margin is 0.300%. When the Leverage Ratio is less than
3.25 to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee margin is 0.250%.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal
when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period; material inaccuracy of
representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any cross-default
to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the ERISA, actual or asserted
invalidity of any guarantee, security document or subordination provision or non-perfection of security interest,
and a change in control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). As of January 2, 2016 the Company
was in compliance with all financial covenants.

**_6.375% Senior Notes_**

On November 9, 2010, the Company issued $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% Senior
Notes. The 6.375% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all of
the Company’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The 6.375% Senior Notes bear interest at an
annual rate equal to 6.375%. Interest is payable on the 6.375% Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each
year. The 6.375% Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2020. The net proceeds from the sale of the 6.375%
Senior Notes were approximately $979,000. The net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings
under another loan facility, reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility and to pay fees
and expenses relating to these transactions. The 6.375% Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the
Company’s domestic subsidiaries.

The indenture governing the 6.375% Senior Notes contains customary events of default which include
(subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest;
breach of other agreements in such indenture; failure to pay certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain final
judgments; failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.

**_Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility_**

The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility provides for up to $275,000 in funding accounted for as a
secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade
receivables. Under the terms of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC (“Receivables
LLC”), a wholly owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the
borrowings, which are funded through conduits and financial institutions that are not affiliated with the
Company. The commitments of any conduits party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility are funded
through the issuance of commercial paper in the short-term market or through committed bank purchasers if the
conduits fail to fund. The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are fully reflected on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes, but the assets of
Receivables LLC will be used first to satisfy the creditors of Receivables LLC, not the Company’s creditors. The
borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the
agreement subject to the Company maintaining sufficient eligible receivables, by continuing to sell trade
receivables to Receivables LLC, unless an event of default occurs. In March 2015, the Company amended the
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility to decrease certain fee rates and extended the termination date to
March 11, 2016.

Availability of funding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility depends primarily upon the
eligible outstanding receivables balance. The outstanding balance under the Accounts Receivable Securitization
Facility is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the line “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility.”
In the case of any creditors party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility that are conduits, unless the
conduits fail to fund, the yield on the commercial paper, which is the conduits’ cost to issue the commercial
paper plus certain dealer fees, is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. If the conduits fail to fund, the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
would be funded through committed bank purchasers, and the interest rate would be payable at the Company’s
option at the rate announced from time to time by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate
(as defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) plus the applicable margin in effect from time to
time. In the case of borrowings from any other creditors party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
that are not conduits or their related committed bank purchasers, the interest rate is payable at the LIBO Rate (as
defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) or, if this rate is unavailable or otherwise does not

accurately reflect the costs to these creditors related to the borrowings, the prime rate. These amounts are also
considered financing costs and are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. In
addition, HBI Receivables LLC is required to make certain payments to a conduit purchaser, a committed
purchaser, or certain entities that provide funding to or are affiliated with them, in the event that assets and
liabilities of a conduit purchaser are consolidated for financial and/or regulatory accounting purposes with certain
other entities.

The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility contains customary events of default and requires the
Company to maintain the same interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio contained from time to time in the
Senior Secured Credit Facility, provided that any changes to such covenants will only be applicable for purposes
of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility if approved by the Managing Agents or their affiliates. As of
January 2, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

The total amount of receivables used as collateral for the credit facility was $332,948 at January 2, 2016 and
is reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in “Trade accounts receivable, net.”

**_Other International Debt_**

In connection with the Hanes Europe Innerwear acquisition, the Company assumed debt (the “Other
International Debt”), totaling $132,574 as of the acquisition date. Concurrent with the closing, $107,665 was
repaid utilizing proceeds from the Euro Term Loan. The long-term debt outstanding as of January 2, 2016
consists of mortgage loans and term loans collateralized by fixed assets. These loans have maturity dates ranging
from January, 2016 to May, 2018, and bear interest primarily based on EURIBOR rates ranging from 1.49% to
6.25% as of January 2, 2016.

**_Future Principal Payments_**

Future principal payments for all of the facilities described above are as follows: $252,819 due in 2016,
$75,793 due in 2017, $77,707 due in 2018, $103,938 due in 2019, $1,483,063 due in 2020 and $513,661 due in
2021 and thereafter.

**_Debt Issuance Costs_**

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred $12,793, $5,560 and $5,630, respectively, in
capitalized debt issuance costs in connection with the amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the
respective lives of the debt instruments, which range from one to 10 years. As of January 2, 2016, the net
carrying value of unamortized debt issuance costs was $32,941 which is included in “Other Noncurrent Assets”
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s debt issuance cost amortization was $7,077, $6,011 and
$6,921 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Company recognizes charges in the “Other expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income for
fees incurred in financing transactions such as refinancing and amendments and for write-offs incurred in the
early extinguishment of debt. In 2015, the Company recognized charges of $3,019 for acceleration of
unamortized debt costs related to the Euro Term and the Revolving Loan Facility. In 2013, the Company
recognized charges of $14,749 for the call premium and acceleration of unamortized debt costs related to the
redemption of the 8% Senior Notes.

**(11)** **Commitments and Contingencies**

The Company is a party to various pending legal proceedings, claims and environmental actions by
government agencies. In accordance with the accounting rules for contingencies, the Company records a
provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated. Any provisions are reviewed at least quarterly
and are adjusted to reflect the impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information
pertinent to the particular matter. The recorded liabilities for these items were not material to the consolidated
financial statements of the Company in any of the years presented. Although the outcome of such items cannot be
determined with certainty, the Company’s legal counsel and management are of the opinion that the final
outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

**_Purchase Commitments_**

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials,
production and finished goods. These agreements, typically with terms ending within a year, require total
payments of $334,235 in 2016 and $7,089 in 2017 and $0 thereafter.

**_Operating Leases_**

The Company leases certain buildings and equipment under agreements that are classified as operating
leases. Rental expense under operating leases was $103,621, $89,569 and $75,178 in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms
in excess of one year) are as follows: $82,660 in 2016, $72,868 in 2017, $64,607 in 2018, $48,191 in 2019,
$36,730 in 2020 and $114,894 thereafter.

**_License Agreements_**

The Company is party to several royalty-bearing license agreements for the use of third party trademarks in
certain of their products. The license agreements typically require a minimum guarantee to be paid either at the
commencement of the agreement, by a designated date during the term of the agreement or by the end of the
agreement period. When payments are made in advance of when they are due, the Company records a
prepayment and amortizes the expense in the “Cost of sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income
uniformly over the guaranteed period. For guarantees required to be paid at the completion of the agreement,
royalties are expensed through “Cost of sales” as the related sales are made. Management has reviewed all
license agreements and has concluded that there are no liabilities recorded at inception of the agreements.

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred royalty expense of approximately $84,733, $57,072
and $42,075, respectively.

Minimum amounts due under the license agreements are approximately $10,248 in 2016, $5,383 in 2017,
$5,645 in 2018, $5,910 in 2019, $6,141 in 2020. In addition to the minimum guaranteed amounts under license
agreements, the Company is a party to a partnership agreement that includes a minimum fee of $5,558 for each
year from 2016 through 2017.

in the recognition of $117,939 of goodwill and $59,950 of intangible assets, which consisted primarily of
perpetual license agreements and distribution relationships. Since acquisition, goodwill decreased $2,454 as a
result of measurement period tax adjustments.

As described in Note, “Acquisitions,” the Company acquired Hanes Europe Innerwear in August 2014,
which resulted in the recognition of $104,145 of goodwill and $365,104 of intangible assets, which consisted
primarily of trademarks, perpetual license agreements and customer and distribution relationships. Since
acquisition, goodwill increased $7,453 as a result of additional working capital payments made and $2,807 as a
result of measurement period adjustments to the acquired income tax balances.

**_Cash Flow Hedges_**

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies
on short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign currency-denominated investments, and other
known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on
the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency
exchange rates.

The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months a net gain from AOCI of
approximately $7,016.

The changes in fair value of derivatives excluded from the Company’s effectiveness assessments and the
ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The effect of cash flow hedge derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income and

**_Derivative Contracts Not Designated As Hedges_**

The Company uses foreign exchange derivative contracts as economic hedges against the impact of foreign
exchange fluctuations on anticipated intercompany purchase and lending transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related
assets and liabilities.

**(15)** **Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities**

Fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes
market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. A three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, is utilized for disclosing the fair value
of the Company’s assets and liabilities. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either
directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data
exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation
techniques:

    - Market approach - prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

    - Cost approach - amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or
replacement cost.

    - Income approach - techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market
expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing and other models.

The Company primarily applies the market approach for commodity derivatives and for all defined benefit
plan investment assets and the income approach for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring
fair value measurements and attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The determination of fair values
incorporates various factors that include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the
impact of credit enhancements, but also the impact of the Company’s nonperformance risk on its liabilities. The
Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment
and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels.

As of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of the Company’s derivative
instruments related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates and defined benefit pension plan investment
assets. The fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that
are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets
and are categorized as Level 2. The fair values of defined benefit pension plan investments include: certain U.S.
equity securities, certain foreign equity securities and debt securities that are determined based on quoted prices
in public markets categorized as Level 1, certain foreign equity securities, certain U.S. equity securities, debt
securities, insurance contracts and commodity investments that are determined based on inputs readily available
in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets categorized as Level 2
and investments in hedge funds of funds and real estate investments that are based on unobservable inputs about
which little or no market data exists that are classified as Level 3. There were no changes during 2015 to the
Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. The hedge
fund of funds and real estate investments have varying redemption terms of monthly, quarterly, semi-annually
and annually, and have required notification periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.

had a carrying value of $2,506,981 and $1,839,314, respectively. The fair values were estimated using quoted
market prices as provided in secondary markets, which consider the Company’s credit risk and market related
conditions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s notes payable, which is classified as a Level 2 liability,
approximated fair value as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, primarily due to the short-term nature of
these instruments.

**(16)** **Defined Benefit Pension Plans**

At January 2, 2016, the Company’s pension plans consisted of the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan, various
nonqualified retirement plans and international plans, which include certain defined benefit plans acquired in
connection with the purchase of Hanes Europe. Benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan were frozen
effective December 31, 2005.

The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income
of the Company’s noncontributory defined benefit pension plans were as follows:

liabilities - Payroll and employee benefits” and “Pension and postretirement benefits” lines of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

**_(a) Measurement Date and Assumptions_**

A December 31 measurement date is used to value plan assets and obligations for the pension plans. In
determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes, as a general benchmark, the single discount rate equivalent
to discounting the expected cash flows from each plan using the yields at each duration from a published yield
curve as of the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on the
Company’s investment policy target allocation of the asset portfolio between various asset classes and the
expected real returns of each asset class over various periods of time. The weighted average actuarial
assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations for the periods presented were
as follows:


**January 2,**
**2016**


**January 3,**
**2015**


**December 28,**
**2013**


**Net periodic benefit cost:**
Discount rate 4.43% 4.96% 4.17%
Long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.61 6.90 7.29
Rate of compensation increase (1) 3.51 3.74 3.74

**Plan obligations:**
Discount rate 4.04% 4.04% 4.96%
Rate of compensation increase (1) 3.51 3.50 3.74

(1) The compensation increase assumption applies to the international plans and portions of the nonqualified
retirement plans, as benefits under these plans were not frozen at January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and
December 28, 2013.

**_(b) Plan Assets, Expected Benefit Payments, and Funding_**

The allocation of pension plan assets as of the respective period end measurement dates is as follows:


**January 2,**
**2016**


**January 3,**
**2015**


**Asset category:**
Hedge fund of funds 41% 38%
U.S. equity securities 17 19
Foreign equity securities 15 15
Debt securities 18 19
Real estate 5 5
Commodities 2 2
Insurance contracts 1 1
Cash and other 1 1

The Company’s asset strategy and primary investment objective are to maximize the principal value of the
plan assets to meet current and future benefit obligations to plan participants and their beneficiaries. To
accomplish this goal, the assets of the plan are broadly diversified to protect against large investment losses and
to reduce the likelihood of excessive volatility of returns. Diversification of assets is achieved through strategic
allocations to various asset classes, as well as various investment styles within these asset classes, and by
retaining multiple, third party investment management firms with complementary investment styles and
philosophies to implement these allocations. The Company has established a target asset allocation based upon
analysis of risk/return tradeoffs and correlations of asset mixes given long-term historical data, prospective
capital market returns and forecasted liabilities of the plans. The target asset allocation approximates the actual
asset allocation as of January 2, 2016. In addition to volatility protection, diversification enables the assets of the
plan the best opportunity to provide adequate returns in order to meet the Company’s investment return
objectives. These objectives include, over a rolling 5-year period, to achieve a total return that exceeds the
required actuarial rate of return for the plan and to outperform a passive portfolio, consisting of a similar asset
allocation.

The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the pension
plan assets. At January 2, 2016, the Company had $167,069 classified as Level 1 assets, $260,323 classified as
Level 2 assets and $381,825 classified as Level 3 assets. At January 3, 2015, the Company had $192,935
classified as Level 1 assets, $248,690 classified as Level 2 assets and $346,373 classified as Level 3 assets. The
Level 1 assets consisted primarily of certain U.S. equity securities, certain debt securities, certain foreign equity
securities and cash and cash equivalents, Level 2 assets consisted primarily of certain debt securities, certain U.S.
equity securities, commodity investments, insurance contracts and certain foreign equity securities, and Level 3
assets consisted primarily of hedge fund of funds and real estate investments. Refer to Note, “Fair Value of
Assets and Liabilities,” for the Company’s complete disclosure of the fair value of pension plan assets.

The Company made a voluntary contribution of $40,000 into the Company’s pension plans in January 2016.
Expected benefit payments are as follows: $61,241 in 2016, $61,652 in 2017, $63,861 in 2018, $66,633 in 2019,
$68,241 in 2020 and $357,746 thereafter.

**_(c) Nonretirement Postemployment Benefit Plans_**

Certain of the international plans, specifically those acquired in connection with the purchase of Hanes
Europe Innerwear, are in substance nonretirement postemployment benefit plans, which are future liabilities

funded through future operational results of the Company. However, for purposes of consolidation the Company
is including these plans within the defined benefit reporting. At January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the total
amounts accrued for these plans were $49,646 and $51,598, respectively and the total gain for the year ended
January 2, 2016 was $499 and while the total expense January 3, 2015 $1,284.

**_(d) Interest Change_**

Beginning in 2016, the Company will change the method utilized to estimate primarily the interest cost
component of net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans from using a single
discount rate as discussed above. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of
the interest component of benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
determination of the benefit obligations to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company will make this change
to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and
to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs. This change will not affect the measurement of the total
benefit obligations as the change in interest costs is completely offset by the actuarial gain or loss reported. The
Company will account for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively
beginning in 2016.

**(17)** **Income Taxes**

The provision for income tax computed by applying the U.S. statutory rate to income before taxes as
reconciled to the actual provisions were:

**Years Ended**

State income tax 1.1 0.6 0.4
Tax on remittance of foreign earnings 9.1 0.8 2.5
Foreign taxes less than U.S. statutory rate (30.8) (24.0) (19.6)
Employee benefits 0.4 0.5 1.0
Change in valuation allowance 2.6 2.1 0.5
Release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves (9.8) (1.7) (2.3)
State tax rate change 2.3 — —
Other, net (0.4) (0.3) (1.0)

Taxes at effective worldwide tax rates 9.5% 13.0% 16.5%

The Company has been granted lower effective income tax rates in two foreign jurisdictions through 2019.
These lower rates, when compared with the country’s statutory rates, resulted in an income tax reduction of
approximately $2,200 ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2015 and $5,000 ($0.01 per diluted share) in both 2014 and
2013.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the respective year-ends were as follows:

Derivatives 3,612 1,994
Intangibles 17,751 32,281
Prepaids 5,316 11,076

Deferred tax liabilities 27,118 45,351

Net deferred tax assets $374,450 $407,138

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

As of January 2, 2016, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $61,358, made up of $47,402 for
foreign loss carryforwards, $1,345 for other foreign deferred tax assets, and $12,611 for federal and state
operating loss carryforwards. The net change in the total valuation allowance for 2015 was $17,601 related to an
increase of $9,588 for foreign loss carryforwards and other foreign deferred tax assets and $8,013 for federal and
state operating loss carryforwards.

At January 2, 2016, the Company has total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $191,871 for
foreign jurisdictions, which will expire as follows:

**Fiscal Year:**
2016 $ 7,783

2018 17,258
2019 34,719
2020 36,437
Thereafter 72,906

At January 2, 2016, the Company had tax credit carryforwards totaling $34,051,which expire beginning
after 2020.

At January 2, 2016, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$61,816 and $360,455, respectively, which expire beginning after 2018.

At January 2, 2016, applicable U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been
provided on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested. If
these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $796,000 would have been
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized a benefit related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits
resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations of $3,587 and $10,391, respectively. Although it is not
reasonably possible to estimate the amount by which unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within
the next 12 months due to uncertainties regarding the timing of examinations and the amount of settlements that
may be paid, if any, to tax authorities, the Company currently expects a reduction of approximately $6,100 for
unrecognized tax benefits accrued at January 2, 2016 within the next 12 months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Balance at December 28, 2013 (gross balance of $51,315) $ 48,353
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 14,703
Additions for tax positions of prior years 10,058
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (10,004)

Balance at January 3, 2015 (gross balance of $66,207) $ 63,110

Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 2,732
Additions for tax positions of prior years 49
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (46,111)

Balance at January 2, 2016 (gross balance of $20,085) $ 19,780

Unrecognized tax benefits of $19,780 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s
annual effective tax rate. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax
matters in income tax expense. The Company recognized $3,669, $636 and $969 for interest and penalties
classified as income tax benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
At January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, the Company had a total of $2,702 and $6,371, respectively, of interest
and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined income
tax returns in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
began an examination of the Company’s 2011 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2013 and of the Company’s
2012 tax year during the third quarter of 2014, both of which were completed during the third quarter of 2015. As
a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $56,427 due to the remeasurement of certain
unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is also currently subject to examination by various state and
international tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the outcomes of both ongoing and future
examinations for the current or prior years to ensure the Company’s provision for income taxes is sufficient. The
Company recognizes liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due and believes its
reserves are adequate in relation to any potential assessments. The outcome of any one examination, some of
which may conclude during the next 12 months, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

**(18)** **Stockholders’ Equity**

The Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and
up to 50,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the Company’s Board of Directors may,
without stockholder approval, increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of
shares of stock of any class or series that the Company is authorized to issue. At January 2, 2016 and January 3,
2015, 391,653 and 400,789 shares, respectively, of common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of
preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

On February 1, 2007, the Company announced that the Board of Directors granted authority for the
repurchase of up to 40,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in
open-market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Additionally,
management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in
connection with share repurchases, which will allow the Company to repurchase shares in the open market during
periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed for the Company and certain of the Company’s
officers and employees pursuant to the Company’s insider trading policy. During 2015, the Company purchased
12,148 shares of the Company’s common stock at a cost of $351,495 (average price of $28.91). Since inception
of the program, the Company has purchased 23,496 shares of common stock at a cost of $426,243 (average price
of $18.13). The primary objective of the share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by
the exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock unit awards, as well as to utilize excess cash to generate
shareholder value.

**_Preferred Stock Purchase Rights_**

Pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of September 1, 2006 and previously amended on March 26,
2015 (the “Rights Agreement”) between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights
Agent, one preferred stock purchase right (a “Right”) was distributed with and attached to each share of the
Company’s common stock. Each Right entitled its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from the
Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A (the
“Series A Preferred Stock”) at an exercise price of $75 per right.

On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Rights Agreement (the “Second
Amendment”). The Second Amendment accelerated the expiration of the Rights from September 1, 2016 to
November 10, 2015 and had the effect of terminating the Rights Agreement on November 10, 2015. At the time

of the termination of the Rights Agreement, all of the Rights distributed to holders of the Company’s common
stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement expired. In connection with the termination of the Rights Agreement, on
November 10, 2015, the Company eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights
and reclassified the Series A Preferred Stock as authorized but undesignated shares of the Company’s preferred
stock.

**_Dividends_**

As part of the Company’s cash deployment strategy, in 2013, the Board of Directors declared the
Company’s first dividends of $0.05 per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2013. Prior to
that declaration, the Company had not paid a cash dividend on its common stock.

In 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized regular quarterly dividends of $0.075 per share,
which were paid in 2014.

In January 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend rate to $0.10
per share on outstanding common stock. During the Company’s 2015 fiscal year, regular quarterly cash
dividends of $0.10 per share were paid on March 3, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 9, 2015 and December 8,
2015.

On March 3, 2015, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split in the form of a 300% stock dividend to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2015. All references to the number of common
shares outstanding, per share amounts and share options data have been restated to reflect the effect of the split
for all periods presented.

In January 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per
share on outstanding common stock to be paid on March 8, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of
business on February 16, 2016.

**(19)** **Business Segment Information**

The Company’s operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a
reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and
International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution
channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s businesses
but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms.

The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows:

    - Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of
men’s underwear, panties, children’s underwear, socks, hosiery and intimate apparel, which includes
bras and shapewear.

    - Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product
categories of branded printwear and retail activewear, as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate
bookstores, mass retail and other channels.

    - Direct to Consumer includes the Company’s value-based (“outlet”) stores and Internet operations that
sell products from the Company’s portfolio of leading brands. The Company’s Internet operations are
supported by its catalogs.

**(amounts in thousands, except per share data)**

    - International primarily relates to the Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia geographic
locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon segment operating profit,
which is defined as operating profit before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The
accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in Note, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.” The Company decided in the first quarter of 2015 to revise the manner in which the
Company allocates certain assets and selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain prior-year segment
assets and segment operating profit disclosures have been revised to conform to the current-year presentation.

**(22)** **Consolidating Financial Information**

In accordance with the indenture governing the Company’s $1,000,000 6.375% Senior Notes issued on
November 9, 2010, as supplemented from time to time, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have guaranteed
the Company’s obligations under the 6.375% Senior Notes. The following presents the condensed consolidating
financial information separately for:

(i) Parent Company, the issuer of the guaranteed obligations. Parent Company includes Hanesbrands
Inc. and its 100% owned operating divisions, which are not legal entities, and excludes its subsidiaries,
which are legal entities;

(ii) Guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, as specified in the Indentures;

(iii) Non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis;

(iv) Consolidating entries and eliminations representing adjustments to (a) eliminate intercompany
transactions between or among Parent Company, the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, (b) eliminate intercompany profit in inventory, (c) eliminate the investments in the Company’s
subsidiaries and (d) record consolidating entries; and

(v) The Company, on a consolidated basis.

The 6.375% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each
guarantor subsidiary, each of which is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by Hanesbrands Inc. A guarantor
subsidiary’s guarantee can be released in certain customary circumstances. Each entity in the consolidating
financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements,
except for the use by the Parent Company and guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to
reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries that are eliminated upon consolidation.

**HANESBRANDS INC.**
**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**
**(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)**
**(unaudited)**

**(1)** **Basis of Presentation**

These statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) and, in accordance with those rules and regulations, do not include all information and
footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Management believes that the
disclosures made are adequate for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
of Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company” or
“Hanesbrands”). In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect
all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows for the interim periods presented herein. The preparation of
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results may vary from these
estimates.

Certain prior year amounts in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, none of which are
material, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no
impact on the Company’s results of operations.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does
not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be
expected for the full year.

**(2)** **Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

**_Consolidation_**

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued an update to their
existing consolidation model, which changes the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it
should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first
quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have an impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Debt Issuance Costs_**

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The new rules were effective for the
Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Cloud Computing_**

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, related to a customer’s accounting for fees paid in a
cloud computing arrangement. The guidance provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license

F-62

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)**
**(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)**
**(unaudited)**

consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement
should be accounted for as a service contract. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first quarter
of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Fair Value Measurement_**

In May 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to fair value measurements.
The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair
value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and requires separate disclosure of
those investments instead. These disclosures were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The
adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

**_Measurement Period Adjustments_**

In September 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which simplify the accounting for measurement
period adjustments by eliminating the requirements to restate prior period financial statements for these
adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment
(including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is
identified. The new standard, which should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that
occur after the effective date, was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new
accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

**_Stock Compensation_**

In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting rules related to accounting for stock compensation. The
new guidance requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income as they occur. The new
guidance also changes the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits, classifying them as operating inflows or
outflows. The new standard, which can be applied retrospectively or prospectively, is effective for the Company
in the first quarter of 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Inventory_**

In July 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require inventory to be recorded at the lower of
cost or net realizable value. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The
Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Revenue from Contracts with Customers_**

In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay effective dates for the new accounting rules related to revenue
recognition for contracts with customers by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to the
accounting rules regarding revenue from contracts with customers, which clarifies revenue recognition when an
agent, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer. In April 2016, the FASB

F-63

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)**
**(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)**
**(unaudited)**

issued an additional update, which clarifies the principle for determining whether a good or service is “separately
identifiable” and, therefore, should be accounted for separately. The new standard will be effective for the
Company in the first quarter of 2018 with retrospective application required. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Hedge Accounting_**

In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting rules related to hedge accounting, which clarifies that a
change in the counterparty to a derivative contract, in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a
hedging relationship. The new standard, which can be adopted prospectively or on a modified retrospective basis,
is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new
accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Lease Accounting_**

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting rules related to lease accounting, which will require
lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases that are not short-term in nature. The
new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently in the process
of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**(3)** **Acquisitions**

**_Knights Apparel_**

In April 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Knights Holdco, Inc. (“Knights Apparel”), a
leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel in the mass retail channel, from Merit Capital Partners in an all
cash transaction valued at $192,888 on an enterprise value basis. The Company funded the acquisition with cash
on hand and short-term borrowings under its Revolving Loan Facility.

Factors that contribute to the amount of goodwill recognized for the acquisition include the value of the
existing work force and cost savings by utilizing the Company’s low-cost supply chain and expected synergies
with existing Company functions. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is not tax deductible.

Since January 2, 2016, goodwill decreased by $3,551 as a result of measurement period adjustments to the
acquired income tax balances. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the first quarter of 2016.

The acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition (April 6, 2015) include the following:

Cash and cash equivalents $ 59
Trade accounts receivable 14,879
Inventories 22,820
Deferred tax assets and other 5,741
Trademarks and other identifiable intangibles 59,950

Total assets acquired 103,449

Deferred tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities 18,142

Total liabilities assumed 24,949

Net assets acquired 78,500
Goodwill 114,388

Purchase price $192,888

**(4)** **Stockholders’ Equity**

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) was computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average
shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS was calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive shares
of common stock using the treasury stock method.

The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows:

**Quarter Ended**


**April 2,**
**2016**


**April 4,**
**2015**


Basic weighted average shares outstanding 386,598 403,578
Effect of potentially dilutive securities:
Stock options 1,400 3,166
Restricted stock units 1,040 1,498
Employee stock purchase plan and other 5 18

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 389,043 408,260

For the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, there were no options or restricted stock units
excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

For the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, the Company declared cash dividends of $0.11 and
$0.10 per share, respectively.

In 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized up to 40,000 shares to be repurchased in openmarket transactions, and such repurchases are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors.
During the quarter ended April 2, 2016, the Company entered into transactions to repurchase 14,243 shares at a
weighted average repurchase price of $26.65 per share. The shares were repurchased at a total cost of $379,901.

Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time
at the Company’s discretion.

As of April 2, 2016, the Company had $182,005 of borrowing availability under the $1,000,000 Revolving
Loan Facility after taking into account outstanding borrowings and $15,495 of standby and trade letters of credit
issued and outstanding under this facility.

In March 2016, the Company amended the accounts receivable securitization facility that it entered into in
November 2007 (the “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility”). This amendment primarily extended the
termination date to March 2017 and changed the borrowing capacity from a fixed capacity to a varying limit
throughout the year, in order to minimize fees for the Company’s unused portion of the facility.

As of April 2, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under its credit facilities.

Total derivative liabilities (5,025) (1,105)

**Net derivative asset (liability)** $(4,555) $ 4,109

**_Cash Flow Hedges_**

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies
on short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign currency-denominated investments and other
known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on
the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency
exchange rates.

The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months a net gain from AOCI of
approximately $65.

The changes in fair value of derivatives excluded from the Company’s effectiveness assessments and the
ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

The effect of cash flow hedge derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of AOCI
and Income is as follows:

**_Derivative Contracts Not Designated As Hedges_**

The Company uses foreign exchange derivative contracts as economic hedges against the impact of foreign
exchange fluctuations on existing accounts receivable and payable balances and intercompany lending
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are not designated as hedges under the
accounting standards and are recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gains or
losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings. Gains or losses on these
contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities.

The effect of derivative contracts not designated as hedges on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income is as follows:

**Amount of Gain (Loss)**
**Recognized in Income**


**Location of Gain (Loss)**

**(9)** **Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities**

As of April 2, 2016, the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of the Company’s derivative instruments related to
foreign exchange rates and deferred compensation plan liabilities. The fair values of foreign currency derivatives
are determined using the cash flows of the foreign exchange contract, discount rates to account for the passage of
time and current foreign exchange market data and are categorized as Level 2. The fair value of deferred
compensation plans is based on readily available current market data and is categorized as Level 2. The
Company’s defined benefit pension plan investments are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring
basis.

There were no changes during the quarter ended April 2, 2016 to the Company’s valuation techniques used
to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1,
Level 2 or Level 3 during the quarter ended April 2, 2016. As of and during the quarter ended April 2, 2016, the
Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a
recurring or non-recurring basis.

**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts
payable approximated fair value as of April 2, 2016 and January 2, 2016. The carrying amount of trade accounts
receivable included allowance for doubtful accounts, chargebacks and other deductions of $14,696 and $13,100
as of April 2, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The fair value of debt, which is classified as a Level 2
liability, was $3,285,216 and $2,537,640 as of April 2, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. Debt had a
carrying value of $3,246,386 and $2,506,981 as of April 2, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. In the first
quarter of 2016, the Company adopted new accounting rules, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. Hence, the carrying value of debt
reflected on the face of the balance sheet reflects the adoption of the new accounting rules. However, the carrying
value of debt reflected in this footnote disclosure reflects the gross amount owed to creditors. The fair values
were estimated using quoted market prices as provided in secondary markets, which consider the Company’s
credit risk and market related conditions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s notes payable, which is
classified as a Level 2 liability, approximated fair value as of April 2, 2016 and January 2, 2016, primarily due to
the short-term nature of these instruments.

**(10)** **Income Taxes**

The Company’s effective income tax rate was 11% and 16% for the quarters ended April 2, 2016 and
April 4, 2015, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate for the quarter ended April 2, 2016 compared to
the quarter ended April 4, 2015 was primarily due to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to domestic
subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries.

**(11)** **Subsequent Event**

The Company announced on April 7, 2016 that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Champion Europe S.p.A (“Champion Europe”), which owns the trademark for the Champion brand in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. The purchase price will be 10 times actual calendar year 2016 earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), subject to adjustment for cash, debt and working
capital. Champion Europe expects calendar year 2016 EBITDA of approximately €20,000. The acquisition,
which is subject to certain closing conditions, is expected to close midyear 2016.

**(12)** **Business Segment Information**

The Company’s operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a
reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and
International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution
channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s
businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. As a result of a
shift in management responsibilities, the Company decided in the first quarter of 2016 to move its wholesale ecommerce business from its Direct to Consumer segment into the respective Innerwear and Activewear
segments. Prior year segment sales and operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current year
presentation.

The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows:

    - Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of
men’s underwear, panties, children’s underwear, socks, hosiery and intimate apparel, which includes
bras and shapewear.

    - Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product
categories of branded printwear and retail activewear, as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate
bookstores, mass retail and other channels.

    - Direct to Consumer includes the Company’s value-based (“outlet”) stores and Internet operations that
sell products from the Company’s portfolio of leading brands.

    - International primarily relates to the Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia geographic
locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon segment operating profit,
which is defined as operating profit before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The
Company decided in the first quarter of 2016 to revise the manner in which the Company allocates certain
selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain prior year segment operating profit disclosures have been
revised to conform to current year presentation. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those
described in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2016.

administrative positions that are considered non-essential and/or duplicative that will be eliminated. As of April 2,
2016, the Company has accrued approximately $50,269 for employee termination and other benefits recognized in
accordance with expected benefit payments for affected employees. The charges are reflected in the “Cost of sales”
and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” lines of the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of April 2,
2016, approximately $3,731 of benefit payments had been made. $30,596 and $19,673, respectively, is included in

**(13)** **Consolidating Financial Information**

In accordance with the indenture governing the Company’s $1,000,000 6.375% Senior Notes issued on
November 9, 2010, as supplemented from time to time, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have guaranteed
the Company’s obligations under the 6.375% Senior Notes. The following presents the condensed consolidating
financial information separately for:

(i) Parent Company, the issuer of the guaranteed obligations. Parent Company includes Hanesbrands
Inc. and its 100% owned operating divisions, which are not legal entities, and excludes its subsidiaries,
which are legal entities;

(ii) Guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, as specified in the Indentures;

(iii) Non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis;

(iv) Consolidating entries and eliminations representing adjustments to (a) eliminate intercompany
transactions between or among Parent Company, the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, (b) eliminate intercompany profit in inventory, (c) eliminate the investments in the Company’s
subsidiaries and (d) record consolidating entries; and

(v) The Company, on a consolidated basis.

The 6.375% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each

subsidiary’s guarantee can be released in certain customary circumstances. Each entity in the consolidating
financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements,
except for the use by the Parent Company and guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to
reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries that are eliminated upon consolidation.
