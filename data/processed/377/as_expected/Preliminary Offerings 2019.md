otherwise requires.

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the offering of the notes. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering memorandum is
personal to the offeree to whom it has been delivered by the initial purchasers and does not constitute an offer to
any other person or to the public generally. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than
the offeree and any person retained to advise such offeree is unauthorized and any disclosure of the contents of
this offering memorandum without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering
memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and to make no photocopies of this offering memorandum or any
documents referred to herein. If you do not purchase any notes or this offering is terminated for any reason, you
must return this offering memorandum and all documents referred to herein to: Barclays Capital Inc., 745
Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019.

Upon receiving this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request from us, and to review, all additional information considered by you to be necessary to
verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained or incorporated by reference herein, (2) you
have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with any
investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, and (3) we have not authorized
any person to deliver any information different from that contained in this offering memorandum. The offering is
being made on the basis of this offering memorandum. Any decision to purchase the notes in the offering must be
based on the information contained in this document. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes to

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We obtained the market and competitive position data used throughout and incorporated in this offering
memorandum from our own research, surveys or studies conducted by third parties and industry or general
publications. Industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained information from sources
believed to be reliable, but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information. While we
believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable, neither we nor the initial purchasers have
independently verified such data and neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to the
accuracy of such information. Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable but it has not been verified
by any independent sources.

**REVIEW BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION**

In connection with the issuance of the notes, we will enter into a registration rights agreement obligating us,
under certain circumstances, to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an exchange offer for
the notes or a shelf registration statement with respect to a resale of such notes. See “Registration Rights.”

In the course of the review by the SEC of any such registration statement, we may be required to make
changes to the description of our businesses, our financial statements and other information. We may also be
required to present certain additional disclosures and financial data not included in this offering memorandum.
While we believe that our financial statements and other information included, or incorporated by reference, in
this offering memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally
accepted accounting principles and the regulations published by the SEC (with the exception of information that
would be required by Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X if the notes were registered under the Exchange Act
(as defined below)), comments by the SEC on the registration statement may require modification or
reformulation of our financial statements and other information we present, or incorporate by reference, in this
offering memorandum and any required modification or reformulation could be significant.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into the offering memorandum constitute
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements, other than statements of

historical or present facts, that address activities, events, outcomes, business strategies and other matters that we
plan, expect, intend, assume, believe, budget, predict, forecast, project, estimate, or anticipate (and other similar
expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
include statements that relate to future events, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our future
earnings, financial position, operational and strategic initiatives, and developments in the healthcare industry.
These forward-looking statements represent management’s expectations, based on currently available
information, as to the outcome and timing of future events, but, by their nature, address matters that are
uncertain. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors—many of which we are
unable to predict or control—that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or healthcare
industry results, to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

   - Our ability to achieve operating and financial targets, attain expected levels of patient volumes, and
identify and execute on measures designed to save or control costs or streamline operations, including
our ability to realize savings under our cost-reduction initiatives;

   - The outcome of the proposed spin-off of our Conifer Health Solutions business (“Conifer”), including
the anticipated timeframe to complete the transaction, its costs and expected benefits, and our ability to
meet related conditions;

   - Potential disruptions to our business or diverted management attention as a result of the proposed
spin-off of Conifer or our cost-reduction efforts, including our plans to outsource certain functions
unrelated to direct patient care;

   - The impact on our business of recent and future modifications of or judicial challenges to the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”) and the enactment of, or changes in, other statutes and
regulations affecting the healthcare industry generally;

   - Cuts to Medicare and Medicaid payment rates or changes in reimbursement practices or to Medicaid
supplemental payment programs;

   - Adverse regulatory developments, government investigations or litigation;

   - Adverse developments with respect to our ability to comply with the terms of the Non-Prosecution
Agreement (as defined below), including any breach of the agreement;

   - Our ability to enter into or renew managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms; and changes
in service mix, revenue mix and surgical volumes, including potential declines in the population covered
under managed care agreements;

   - The effect that adverse economic conditions, consumer behavior and other factors have on our volumes
and our ability to collect outstanding receivables on a timely basis, among other things, and increases in
the amount of uninsured accounts and deductibles and copays for insured accounts;

   - Our success in completing acquisitions, divestitures and other corporate development transactions; and
our success in entering into, and managing the relationships and risks associated with, joint ventures;

   - Our success in recruiting and retaining physicians and other healthcare professionals;;

   - The impact of competition on all aspects of our business;

   - The impact of our significant indebtedness; the availability and terms of capital to fund the operation
and expansion of our business; and our ability to comply with our debt covenants and, over time, reduce
leverage;

   - Potential security threats, catastrophic events and other disruptions affecting our information technology
and related systems;

iv


-----

   - The timing and impact of additional changes in federal tax laws, regulations and policies, and the
outcome of pending and any future tax audits, disputes and litigation associated with our tax positions;
and

   - Other factors and risks referenced in this offering memorandum and our other public filings.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering
memorandum, “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018, “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2019 and “Forward-Looking Statements” under Item 1 of Part I of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as such discussions may be further updated by
subsequent filings we make with the SEC.

When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other
cautionary statements included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Should one or more of
the risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum occur, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed
in any forward-looking statement. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update any information contained
in a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its entirety and, therefore, disclaim any
resulting liability for potentially related damages. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Before deciding whether to purchase the notes, you should read carefully this offering memorandum, the_
_documents incorporated by reference herein, and the following description of risks. Any or all of the following_
_risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and_
_prospects. In addition, certain factors that may adversely affect our business are discussed in our periodic_
_reports referred to in “Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties—many of which are beyond our control—that
may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations.
If one or more of the events discussed in this offering memorandum were to occur, actual outcomes could differ
materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements we make in this offering
memorandum or our filings with the SEC, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity
could be materially adversely affected.

**_We cannot predict the impact that modifications of the Affordable Care Act may have on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations or cash flows._**

The initial expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act resulted in an increase in
the number of patients using our facilities with either private or public program coverage and a decrease in
uninsured and charity care admissions. Although a substantial portion of both our patient volumes and, as result,
our revenues has historically been derived from government healthcare programs, reductions to our
reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of the ACA have been partially offset by
increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals.

The President issued an executive order in January 2017 declaring that it is the official policy of his
administration to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directing the heads of all executive departments and
agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law
while the ACA remains in effect. The White House also sent a memorandum to federal agencies directing them
to freeze any new or pending regulations. In October 2017, the administration announced that reimbursements to
insurance companies for ACA cost-sharing reduction plans offered through the health insurance marketplace
would be discontinued. CSR payments compensate insurers for subsidizing out-of-pocket costs for low-income
enrollees. Without the CSR payments, many insurers increased premiums for plans offered on ACA exchanges
and a few withdrew entirely from offering plans on some of the exchanges. In addition, in December 2017,
Congress passed and the President signed a tax reform bill into law that, among other things, eliminates the
ACA’s individual mandate penalty for not buying health insurance starting in 2019. The Congressional Budget
Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that eliminating the mandate penalty starting in
2019—and making no other changes to the then-current law—would cause the number of people with health
insurance to decrease by 4 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2027. Members of Congress have also proposed
measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payer proposals. We cannot
predict if or when further modification of the ACA will occur or what action, if any, Congress might take with
respect to eventually repealing and possibly replacing the law.

Furthermore, there have also been successful judicial challenges to the ACA, including a December 2018
ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas that the ACA’s individual mandate is
unconstitutional. Because the judge’s order was stayed pending appeal, the decision’s near-term impact on health
insurance coverage under the ACA may be limited; however, uncertainty over the future of the ACA has
intensified. The ultimate outcome of this decision and other judicial challenges is indeterminate. We are also
unable to predict the impact of administrative, regulatory and legislative changes, and market reactions to those
changes, on our future revenues and operations. However, if the ultimate impact is that significantly fewer

6


-----

individuals have private or public health coverage, we likely will experience decreased volumes, reduced
revenues and an increase in uncompensated care, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash
flows. This negative effect will be exacerbated if the ACA’s reductions in Medicare reimbursement and
reductions in Medicare DSH payments that have already taken effect are not reversed if the law is repealed or if
further reductions (including Medicaid DSH reductions scheduled to take effect in federal fiscal years 2020
through 2025) are made.

**_Further changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs,_**
**_including reductions in scale and scope, could have an adverse effect on our business._**

For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 20% and 9% of our net patient service revenues from
our hospitals and related outpatient facilities were from the Medicare program and various state Medicaid
programs, respectively, in each case excluding Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs. The Medicare
and Medicaid programs are subject to: statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations
and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating
payments or reimbursements, among other things; requirements for utilization review; and federal and state
funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government
programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments
to our facilities, which could in turn adversely affect our overall business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Several states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to
result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate
with balanced budgets, and the Medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a state’s budget, states can
be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce or not increase their Medicaid
expenditures. In addition, some states delay issuing Medicaid payments to providers to manage state
expenditures. As an alternative means of funding provider payments, many of the states in which we operate
have adopted provider fee programs or have received federal government waivers allowing them to test new
approaches and demonstration projects to improve care. The timing of federal approval of these state-based
Medicaid provider fee revenue programs – particularly the California provider fee program – may have an impact
on our net operating revenues and cash flows in any given period. Continuing pressure on state budgets and other
factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays, changes to Medicaid
supplemental payment programs or additional taxes on hospitals.

In general, we are unable to predict the effect of future government healthcare funding policy changes on
our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by
governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries’ hospitals are excluded from
participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government healthcare program, there could be a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Our business and financial results could be harmed if we are alleged to have violated existing regulations or if_**
**_we fail to comply with new or changed regulations._**

Our hospitals, outpatient centers and related healthcare businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and
local regulation relating to, among other things, licensure, contractual arrangements, conduct of operations,
privacy of patient information, ownership of facilities, physician relationships, addition of facilities and services,
and reimbursement rates for services. The laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry are
extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for
guidance. Moreover, under the ACA, the government and its contractors may suspend Medicare and Medicaid
payments to providers of services “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.” The potential
consequences for violating such laws, rules or regulations include reimbursement of government program
payments, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, including treble damages, fines, which could be

7


-----

significant, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, or criminal sanctions against current or
former employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or cash
flows. Even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a
material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and our business reputation could suffer.

Furthermore, healthcare, as one of the largest industries in the United States, continues to attract much
legislative interest and public attention. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local
healthcare regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Further changes
in the regulatory framework negatively affecting healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

As we explore outsourcing and offshoring of certain functions unrelated to direct patient care to enhance
efficiency, we must ensure that those operations will be compliant with U.S. healthcare industry-specific
requirements. In addition, we are required to comply with various federal and state labor laws, rules and
regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues. From time to time, we have been and expect
to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws,
rules and regulations.

Conifer and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local consumer protection and other
laws governing such topics as privacy, financial services, and billing and collections activities. Regulations
governing Conifer’s operations are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different
jurisdictions. In addition, a regulatory determination made by, or a settlement or consent decree entered into with,
one regulatory agency may not be binding upon, or preclude, investigations or regulatory actions by other
agencies. Conifer’s failure to comply with applicable consumer protection and other laws could result in, among
other things, the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of
contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), the imposition of fines or refunds, and other civil and
criminal penalties, some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations. In addition,
Conifer’s failure to comply with the statutes and regulations applicable to it could result in reduced demand for
its services, invalidate all or portions of some of Conifer’s services agreements with its clients, give clients the
right to terminate Conifer’s services agreements with them or give rise to contractual liabilities, among other
things, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer’s business. Furthermore, if Conifer or its
subsidiaries become subject to fines or other penalties, it could harm Conifer’s reputation, thereby making it
more difficult for Conifer to retain existing clients or attract new clients.

**_If we breach or otherwise fail to comply with our Non-Prosecution Agreement, we could be subject to criminal_**
**_prosecution, substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, any of_**
**_which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows._**

In September 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Tenet HealthSystem Medical, Inc., entered into a
Non-Prosecution Agreement (the “Non-Prosecution Agreement” or “NPA”) with the DOJ’s Criminal Division,
Fraud Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia (together, the “Offices”). If,
during the term of the NPA, THSMI commits any felony under federal law, or if the Company commits any
felony related to the Anti-kickback Statute, or if THSMI or the Company fails to cooperate or otherwise fails to
fulfill the obligations set forth in the NPA, then THSMI, the Company and our affiliates could be subject to
prosecution, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and other substantial costs and
penalties. The Offices retain sole discretion over determining whether there has been a breach of the NPA and
whether to pursue prosecution. Any liability or consequences associated with a failure to comply with the NPA
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_We could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant_**
**_legal actions._**

We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, antitrust and employment class action lawsuits, and other
legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large demands, as well as
substantial defense costs. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages, litigants are seeking recoveries
under new theories of liability that might not be subject to such caps. Our professional and general liability
insurance does not cover all claims against us, and it may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us
to maintain at adequate levels, as the healthcare industry has seen significant increases in the cost of such
insurance due to increased litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us
or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs.
Additionally, all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. If the
aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could
deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Any losses
not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working
capital. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or
their obligations to defend, pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due. In that case or if payments
of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_If we are unable to enter into, maintain and renew managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable_**
**_terms, if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if_**
**_we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers, our results of operations could be adversely affected._**

The amount of our managed care net patient service revenues, including Medicare and Medicaid managed
care programs, from our hospitals and related outpatient facilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was
approximately $9.2 billion, which represented approximately 65% of our total net patient service revenues. In
addition, in the year ended December 31, 2018, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per
admission from the hospitals and related outpatient facilities in our Hospital Operations and other segment was
approximately 89% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including
managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with HMOs,
insurers offering preferred provider arrangements and other managed care plans, as well as add new facilities to
our existing agreements at contracted rates, significantly affects our revenues and operating results. We currently
have thousands of managed care contracts with various HMOs and PPOs; however, our top ten managed care
payers generated 65% of our managed care net patient service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Because of this concentration, we may experience a short or long-term adverse effect on our net operating
revenues if we cannot renew, replace or otherwise mitigate the impact of expired contracts with significant
payers. Furthermore, any disputes between us and significant managed care payers could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2018, 61% of our net
accounts receivable for our Hospital Operations and other segment was due from managed care payers.

Private payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with
hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in
managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs. Any negotiated discount programs we agree to generally limit
our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs. Furthermore, the ongoing trend toward
consolidation among private managed care payers tends to increase their bargaining power over prices and fee
structures. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to renew existing managed care contracts and
enter into new managed care contracts on competitive terms. Other healthcare companies, including some with
greater financial resources, greater geographic coverage or a wider range of services, may compete with us for
these opportunities. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed
care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Any material
reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services or any significant difficulties in collecting

9

receivables from managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

**_Our cost-reduction initiatives may not deliver the benefits we expect, and actions taken may adversely affect_**
**_our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent, in part, on various cost-reduction
initiatives, including a recently announced strategy to explore outsourcing certain functions unrelated to direct
patient care. We may encounter challenges in executing our cost-reduction initiatives and not achieve the
intended cost savings. In addition, we may face wrongful termination, discrimination or other legal claims from
employees affected by any workforce reductions, and we may incur substantial costs defending against such
claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims may also significantly increase our severance costs. Workforce
reductions, whether as a result of internal restructuring or in connection with outsourcing efforts, may result in
the loss of numerous long-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, the reallocation of
certain job responsibilities and the disruption of business continuity, all of which could negatively affect
operational efficiencies and increase our operating expenses in the short term. Moreover, outsourcing and
offshoring may expose us to additional risks, such as reduced control over operational quality and timing, foreign
political and economic instability, and compliance and regulatory challenges. Our failure to effectively execute
our cost-reduction initiatives may lead to significant volatility, and a decline, in the price of our common stock.
We cannot guarantee that our cost-reduction initiatives will be successful, and we may need to take additional
steps in the future to achieve our profitability goals.

**_We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in completing the proposed spin-off of Conifer or_**
**_in divesting assets in non-core markets._**

We cannot predict the outcome of the process we have begun to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Conifer. We
cannot provide any assurances regarding the timeframe for completing the spin-off, the allocation of assets and
liabilities between Tenet and Conifer, that the other conditions of the spin-off will be met, or that the spin-off
will be completed at all. We also continue to exit service lines, businesses and markets that we believe are no
longer strategic to our long-term growth. To that end, since January 1, 2018, we divested 11 hospitals in the
United States, as well as all of our operations in the United Kingdom. We cannot provide any assurances that
completed, planned or future divestitures or other strategic transactions will achieve their business goals or the
cost and service synergies we expect.

With respect to all proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may fail to obtain applicable regulatory
approvals for such divestitures, including any approval that may be required under our NPA. Moreover, we may
encounter difficulties in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which
could delay the receipt of anticipated proceeds necessary for us to complete our planned strategic objectives. In
addition, our divestiture activities have required, and may in the future require, us to retain significant pre-closing
liabilities, recognize impairment charges or agree to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to reenter the
applicable market, which may be material. Furthermore, our divestiture or other corporate development activities
(including the planned spin-off of Conifer) may present financial and operational risks, including (1) the
diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, (2) adverse effects (including a deterioration in
the related asset or business and, in Conifer’s case, the loss of existing clients and the difficulties associated with
securing new clients) from the announcement of the planned or potential activity, and (3) the challenges
associated with separating personnel and financial and other systems.

**_A spin-off of Conifer could adversely affect our ability to make required payments on our existing_**
**_indebtedness and future indebtedness, including our obligations under the notes offered hereby._**

Conifer contributes a significant portion of the Company’s earnings and cash flows. We have begun to
pursue a tax-free spin-off of Conifer. Although there can be no assurance that this process will result in a

10


-----

consummated transaction, any separation of all or a portion of Conifer’s business could adversely affect our
ability to meet our debt service obligations, including with respect to the notes offered hereby, by reducing our
earnings, cash flows and capital resources.

**_Conifer operates in a highly competitive industry, and its current or future competitors may be able to compete_**
**_more effectively than Conifer does, which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer’s margins, growth_**
**_rate and market share._**

As we have begun to pursue a spin-off of Conifer, we are continuing to market Conifer’s revenue cycle
management, patient communications and engagement services, and value-based care solutions businesses. The
announcement of our plans to spin off Conifer may have an adverse impact on Conifer’s ability to secure new
clients. There can be no assurance that Conifer will be successful in generating new client relationships,
including with respect to hospitals we or Conifer’s other clients sell, as the respective buyers of such hospitals
may not continue to use Conifer’s services or, if they do, they may not do so under the same contractual terms.
The market for Conifer’s solutions is highly competitive, and we expect competition may intensify in the future.
Conifer faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management market,
as well as from the staffs of hospitals and other healthcare providers who handle these processes internally. In
addition, electronic medical record software vendors may expand into services offerings that compete with
Conifer. To be successful, Conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or
changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations and client requirements. Moreover, existing or new
competitors may introduce technologies or services that render Conifer’s technologies or services obsolete or less
marketable. Even if Conifer’s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors,
current or potential clients might prefer competitive technologies or services to Conifer’s technologies and
services. Furthermore, increased competition has resulted and may continue to result in pricing pressures, which
could negatively impact Conifer’s margins, growth rate or market share.

**_Economic factors, consumer behavior and other dynamics have affected, and may continue to impact, our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We believe broad economic factors (including high unemployment rates in some of the markets our
facilities serve), instability in consumer spending, uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act,
and the continued shift of additional financial responsibility to insured patients through higher co-pays,
deductibles and premium contributions, among other dynamics, have affected our service mix, revenue mix and
volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in
the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. The
U.S. economy remains unpredictable. If industry trends, such as reductions in commercial managed care
enrollment and patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and non-emergency healthcare procedures,
worsen or if general economic conditions deteriorate, we may not be able to sustain future profitability, and our
liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed.

**_Trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may require us to record charges that may negatively impact_**
**_our results of operations._**

As a result of factors that have negatively affected our industry generally and our business specifically, we
have been required to record various charges in our results of operations. During the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $77 million and $402 million, respectively.
Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining operating results in our hospitals,
which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals’ most
recent projections. If these projections are not met, or negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, future
impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges,
which could be material. Future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units
could also result in future impairments of our goodwill. Any such charges could negatively impact our results of
operations.

**_When we acquire new assets or businesses, we become subject to various risks and uncertainties that could_**
**_adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and we expect to pursue similar transactions in
the future. A key business strategy for USPI, in particular, is the acquisition and development of facilities,
primarily through the formation of joint ventures with physicians and healthcare systems. With respect to
planned or future transactions, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to identify suitable
candidates, consummate transactions on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve synergies or other benefits in a
timely manner or at all. Furthermore, companies or operations acquired may not be profitable or may not achieve
the profitability that justifies the investments made. In addition, we may face significant challenges in integrating
personnel and financial and other systems. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of
equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities, and increased operating expenses,
any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

**_USPI and our hospital-based joint ventures depend on existing relationships with key healthcare system_**
**_partners. If we are unable to maintain historical relationships with these healthcare systems, or enter into new_**
**_relationships, we may be unable to implement our business strategies successfully._**

USPI and our hospital-based joint ventures depend in part on the efforts, reputations and success of
healthcare system partners and the strength of our relationships with those healthcare systems. Our joint ventures
could be adversely affected by any damage to those healthcare systems’ reputations or to our relationships with
them. In addition, damage to our business reputation could negatively impact the willingness of healthcare
systems to enter into relationships with us or USPI. If we are unable to maintain existing arrangements on
favorable terms or enter into relationships with additional healthcare system partners, we may be unable to
implement our business strategies for our joint ventures successfully.

**_The remaining put/call arrangements associated with USPI, if settled in cash, will require us to utilize our_**
**_cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy the payment obligations in respect of such arrangements._**

As part of the formation of USPI in 2015, we entered into a put/call agreement with respect to the equity
interests in USPI held by our joint venture partners at that time. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, we paid
$1.473 billion in the aggregate to purchase additional shares of USPI to increase our ownership interest in USPI
to 95%.

We have also entered into a separate put/call agreement (the “Baylor Put/Call Agreement”) with respect to
the remaining 5% outside ownership interest in USPI held by Baylor University Medical Center. Each year
starting in 2021, Baylor may require us to purchase, or “put” to us, up to 33.3% of their total shares in USPI held
as of January 1, 2017. In each year that Baylor does not put the full 33.3% of USPI’s shares allowable, we may
call the difference between the number of shares Baylor put and the maximum number of shares they could have
put that year. In addition, the Baylor Put/Call Agreement contains a call option pursuant to which we have the
ability to acquire all of Baylor’s ownership interest by 2024. In each case, we have the ability to choose whether
to settle the purchase price for the Baylor put/call in cash or shares of our common stock.

The put and call arrangements described above, to the extent settled in cash, may require us to dedicate a
substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of such arrangements, which
may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development
activities. Similarly, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to satisfy our payment obligations in
respect of such arrangements, which could have important consequences to our business and operations, as
described more fully below under “Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—Our level of indebtedness could, among
_other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to_
_react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the_
_agreements relating to our indebtedness.”_

**_Our joint venture arrangements are subject to a number of operational risks that could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We have invested in a number of joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warranted the use of
these structures, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future. These joint ventures may not be
profitable or may not achieve the profitability that justifies the investments made. Furthermore, the nature of a
joint venture requires us to consult with and share certain decision-making powers with unaffiliated third parties,
some of which may be not-for-profit healthcare systems. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their
obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business or strategic plans. In
that case, our results could be adversely affected or we may be required to increase our level of financial
commitment to the joint venture. Moreover, differences in economic or business interests or goals among joint
venture participants could result in delayed decisions, failures to agree on major issues and even litigation. If
these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business or strategic plans, or if our joint venture
partners take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, our results could
be adversely affected. In addition, our relationships with not-for-profit healthcare systems and the joint venture
agreements that govern these relationships are intended to be structured to comply with current revenue rulings
published by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as case law relevant to joint ventures between for-profit and
not-for-profit healthcare entities. Material changes in these authorities could adversely affect our relationships
with not-for-profit healthcare systems and related joint venture arrangements.

Our participation in joint ventures is also subject to the risks that:

   - We could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making
authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential
disputes.

   - We may not be able to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners (including healthcare
systems), which could limit our future growth potential and could have an adverse effect on our business
strategies.

   - Our joint venture partners could have investment or operational goals that are not consistent with our
corporate-wide objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for investments or future growth
opportunities.

   - Our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital
contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations as joint venture partners, which may require us to
infuse our own capital into any such venture on behalf of the related joint venture partner or partners
despite other competing uses for such capital.

   - Many of our existing joint ventures require that one of our wholly owned affiliates provide a working
capital line of credit to the joint venture, which could require us to allocate substantial financial
resources to the joint venture potentially impacting our ability to fund our other short-term obligations.

   - Some of our existing joint ventures require mandatory capital expenditures for the benefit of the
applicable joint venture, which could limit our ability to expend funds on other corporate opportunities.

   - Our joint venture partners may have exit rights that would require us to purchase their interests upon the
occurrence of certain events or the passage of certain time periods, which could impact our financial
condition by requiring us to incur additional indebtedness in order to complete such transactions or,
alternatively, in some cases we may have the option to issue shares of our common stock to our joint
venture partners to satisfy such obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing
stockholders.

   - Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of
interest issues.

   - Any sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets of the joint venture
may require consents from our joint venture partners, which we may not be able to obtain.

13


-----

   - Certain corporate-wide or strategic transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a
joint venture partner (including termination or liquidation rights) depending on how the transaction is
structured, which could impact our ability to complete such transactions.

   - Our joint venture arrangements that involve financial and ownership relationships with physicians and
others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals or other healthcare facilities
are subject to greater regulatory scrutiny from government enforcement agencies. While we endeavor to
comply with the applicable safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute, certain of our current
arrangements, including joint venture arrangements, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

**_It is essential to our ongoing business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the_**
**_specialties required to support our services and that we maintain good relations with those physicians._**

The success of our business depends in significant part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting
and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of our hospitals
and other facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their
practices. Physicians are often not employees of the hospitals or surgery centers at which they practice. Members
of the medical staffs of our facilities also often serve on the medical staffs of facilities we do not operate, and
they are free to terminate their association with our facilities or admit their patients to competing facilities at any
time. In addition, although physicians who own interests in our facilities are generally subject to agreements
restricting them from owning an interest in competitive facilities, we may not learn of, or be unsuccessful in
preventing, our physician partners from acquiring interests in competitive facilities.

We expect to encounter increased competition from health insurers and private equity companies seeking to
acquire providers in the markets where we operate physician practices and, where permitted by law, employ
physicians. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians
in certain specialties and the difficulties that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice
insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance. Furthermore, our ability to recruit and employ
physicians is closely regulated. For example, the types, amount and duration of compensation and assistance we
can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the Stark law, the Anti-kickback Statute, state anti-kickback
statutes and related regulations. All arrangements with physicians must also be fair market value and
commercially reasonable. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of quality physicians by
providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment, and facilities that meet the needs of
those physicians and their patients, physicians may choose not to refer patients to our facilities, admissions and
outpatient visits may decrease and our operating performance may decline.

**_Our labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and_**
**_labor union activity._**

The operations of our facilities are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and
medical support personnel, including nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our employed
physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining employees, and, like others in
the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of critical-care nurses in certain disciplines and
geographic areas. As a result, from time to time, we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and
retain experienced employees, make greater investments in education and training for newly licensed medical
support personnel, or hire more expensive temporary or contract employees. Furthermore, state-mandated nursestaffing ratios in California affect not only our labor costs, but, if we are unable to hire the necessary number of
experienced nurses to meet the required ratios, they may also cause us to limit volumes, which would have a
corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues. In general, our failure to recruit and retain qualified
management, experienced nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. At December 31,
2018, approximately 26% of the employees in our Hospital Operations and other segment were represented by

14


-----

labor unions. Less than 1% of the employees in our Ambulatory Care and Conifer segments belong to a union.
Unionized employees—primarily registered nurses and service, technical and maintenance workers—are located
at 35 of our hospitals, the majority of which are in California, Florida and Michigan. When negotiating collective
bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is a possibility
that strikes could occur, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs and have
an adverse effect on our patient volumes and net operating revenues. Organizing activities by labor unions could
increase our level of union representation in future periods, which could result in increases in salaries, wages and
benefits expense.

**_Our hospitals, outpatient centers and other healthcare businesses operate in competitive environments, and_**
**_competition in our markets can adversely affect patient volumes._**

The healthcare business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other healthcare
providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals and outpatient centers in the local
communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer, and, in some cases, our competitors (1) are
more established or newer than ours, (2) may offer a broader array of services or more desirable facilities to
patients and physicians than ours, and (3) may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer
patients, among other things. Furthermore, healthcare consumers are now able to access hospital performance
data on quality measures and patient satisfaction, as well as standard charges for services, to compare competing
providers; if any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality
measures or patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are or are perceived to be higher than our
competitors, we may attract fewer patients. Additional quality measures and trends toward clinical or billing
transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes.

In the future, we expect to encounter increased competition from system-affiliated hospitals and healthcare
companies, as well as health insurers and private equity companies seeking to acquire providers, in specific
geographic markets. We also face competition from specialty hospitals (some of which are physician-owned) and
unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians
and personnel. In recent years, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency
departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has
increased significantly. Furthermore, some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by
government agencies or not-for-profit organizations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and
can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. If our competitors are better able to attract
patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than we
are, we may experience an overall decline in patient volumes.

**_Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, catastrophic events and other disruptions_**
**_affecting our information technology and related systems._**

Information technology is a critical component of the day-to-day operation of our business. We rely on our
information technology to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including protected health
information, personally identifiable information, and our proprietary and confidential business performance data.
We utilize electronic health records and other information technology in connection with all of our operations,
including our billing and supply chain and labor management operations. Our systems, in turn, interface with and
rely on third-party systems. Although we monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have
a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the integrity,
security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store, the information technology and infrastructure
we use have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or breaches due
to employee error or malfeasance. Attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, security or availability of data
we process, transmit or store, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, devices or businesses.
While we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of our systems, the preventive actions we take to
reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient in the future. As

15


-----

cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to
implement effective protective measures, and we will be required to expend significant additional resources to
continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our
information systems and infrastructure, and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks.
Furthermore, we have an increased risk of security breaches or compromised intellectual property rights as a
result of outsourcing certain functions unrelated to direct patient care. Though we have insurance against some
cyber-risks and attacks, it may not offset the impact of a material loss event.

Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who
may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and
may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. A breach or attack affecting any of these third
parties could similarly harm our business. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other healthcare services
companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of consumer confidence in our industry
that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security
measures or of the healthcare industry in general, which could result in reduced use of our services.

Our networks and technology systems are also subject to disruption due to events such as a major
earthquake, fire, hurricane, telecommunications failure, ransomware attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic
event. Any breach or system interruption of our information systems or of third parties with access to our
sensitive and confidential data could result in: the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of such data;
interruptions and delays in our normal business operations (including the collection of revenues); patient harm;
potential liability under privacy, security, consumer protection or other applicable laws; regulatory penalties; and
negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

**_The utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as_**
**_defined in the Internal Revenue Code._**

At December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately
$1.0 billion pre-tax available to offset future taxable income. These NOL carryforwards will expire in the years
2027 to 2034. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a
company’s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an “ownership change”
as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company’s “five-percent
shareholders” (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by
more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. (This is different from a change in
beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws.) These ownership changes include purchases of
common stock under share repurchase programs, a company’s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of
company stock by five-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock.
While we expect to be able to realize our total NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, if an ownership
change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an
annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no
assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. Furthermore, we could be required to
record a valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized, which
could adversely impact our results of operations.

**_The industry trend toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models may negatively impact our_**
**_revenues._**

Value-based purchasing and alternative payment model initiatives of both governmental and private payers
tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our
hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet
expected quality standards. Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to

16


-----

receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded
automatically. In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive
increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have “excess readmissions” for specified conditions will
receive reduced reimbursement. Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the
treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions (“HACs”), unless the conditions were present at admission.
Hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for HACs in the previous year receive reduced
Medicare reimbursements. Moreover, the ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to
reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.

The ACA also created the CMS Innovation Center to test innovative payment and service delivery models
that have the potential to reduce Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program expenditures while
preserving or enhancing the quality of care for beneficiaries. Participation in some of these models is voluntary;
however, participation in certain bundled payment arrangements is mandatory for providers located in randomly
selected geographic locations. Generally, the bundled payment models hold hospitals financially accountable for
the quality and costs for an entire episode of care for a specific diagnosis or procedure from the date of the
hospital admission or inpatient procedure through 90 days post-discharge, including services not provided by the
hospital, such as physician, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health services. Under the
mandatory models, hospitals are eligible to receive incentive payments or will be subject to payment reductions
within certain corridors based on their performance against quality and spending criteria. In 2015, CMS finalized
a five-year bundled payment model, called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model,
which includes hip and knee replacements, as well as other major leg procedures. Seventeen hospitals in our
Hospital Operations and other segment and four of USPI’s surgical hospitals currently participate in the CJR
model. In addition, 42 hospitals in our Hospital Operations and other segment and five of USPI’s surgical
hospitals participate in the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCIA”) program that
became effective October 1, 2018. USPI also holds the CMS contract for four physician group practices
participating in the BPCIA program. We cannot predict what impact, if any, these demonstration programs will
have on our inpatient volumes, net revenues or cash flows.

There is also a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models
for healthcare services. Many large commercial payers expect hospitals to report quality data, and several of
these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. We expect value-based
purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become
more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.

We are unable at this time to predict how the industry trend toward value-based purchasing and alternative
payment models will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, particularly if
we are unable to meet the quality and cost standards established by both governmental and private payers.

**_Our business and financial results could be harmed by a national or localized outbreak of a highly contagious_**
**_or epidemic disease._**

If an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the Zika virus or the Ebola virus, were to occur nationally or
in one of the regions our hospitals serve, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. The
treatment of a highly contagious disease at one of our facilities may result in a temporary shutdown or diversion
of patients. In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid
medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues. Furthermore, we cannot predict
the costs associated with the potential treatment of an infectious disease outbreak by our hospitals or preparation
for such treatment.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our level of indebtedness could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to_**
**_fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from_**
**_meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, as of June 30, 2019, we would have had debt of approximately $14.9
billion aggregate principal amount outstanding, including (i) $390 million of borrowing under our Credit
Agreement, (ii) the notes and other debt secured on a pari passu basis with the notes of $6.07 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding (excluding $100 million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding under our letter of
credit facility agreement (as amended, “LC Facility”)), (iii) senior secured second lien notes and other debt
secured on a pari passu basis with our senior secured second lien notes of $2.91 billion aggregate principal
amount outstanding and (iv) $5.51 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes, but excluding (a) capital leases
and mortgage notes and (b) unamortized issue costs, note discounts and premiums, as well as $102 million in
standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate, under our senior secured revolving credit facility (as
amended, the “Credit Agreement”) and our letter of credit facility agreement (as amended, the “LC Facility”).
Our Credit Agreement is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of substantially all of our domestic wholly
owned acute care and specialty hospitals, and our LC Facility is guaranteed and secured by a first priority pledge
of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis
with our existing senior secured notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital market, bank
credit and other financing activities, depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time.

The interest expense associated with our indebtedness offsets a substantial portion of our operating income.
During 2018, our interest expense was $1.004 billion and represented 61% of our $1.647 billion of operating
income. As a result, relatively small percentage changes in our operating income can result in a relatively large
percentage change in our net income and earnings per share, both positively and negatively. In addition:

   - Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us
at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

   - We may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business, in the healthcare industry or
in the economy generally, or if federal or state governments substantially limit or reduce reimbursement
under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.

   - Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital
expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our
financial obligations.

   - Our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future capital
expenditures, working capital, acquisitions or other needs.

   - Our significant indebtedness may result in the market value of our stock being more volatile, potentially
resulting in larger investment gains or losses for our shareholders, than the market value of the common
stock of other companies that have a relatively smaller amount of indebtedness.

   - A significant portion of our outstanding debt is either subject to early prepayment penalties, such as
“make-whole premiums,” or is not currently callable. As a result, it may be costly to pursue debt
repayment as a deleveraging strategy.

Furthermore, our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes
contain, and any future debt obligations may contain, covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to
pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets. See “Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our
_indebtedness may adversely affect us.”_

18


-----

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take_**
**_other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and
operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial,
business and other factors that may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of
cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on
our indebtedness.

In addition, our ability to meet our debt service obligations is dependent upon the operating results of our
subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us. We hold most of our
assets at, and conduct substantially all of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries. Moreover, we
are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt
service and other obligations, including payment on our outstanding debt. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to
applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries. Our less than
wholly owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us in their
financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to service their
respective debt obligations.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including those required for operating our existing facilities, for
integrating our historical acquisitions or for future corporate development activities, and such reduction or delay
could continue for years. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure
or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that
these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or that these
actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our Credit
Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes.

**_Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us._**

Our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various
covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

   - incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;

   - incur liens;

   - make certain investments;

   - provide subsidiary guarantees;

   - consummate asset sales;

   - redeem debt that is subordinated in right of payment to outstanding indebtedness;

   - enter into sale and lease-back transactions;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

   - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

These restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.

In addition, so long as any obligation or commitment is outstanding under our Credit Agreement and
LC Facility, the terms of such facilities require us to maintain a financial ratio relating to our ability to satisfy
certain fixed expenses, including interest payments. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial

19


-----

ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.
These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital
expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or
otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. In addition, a breach of any of these covenants
could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay the indebtedness
immediately. Under these conditions, we are not certain whether we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient
funds to make accelerated payments.

**_Despite current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt or otherwise increase our_**
**_leverage. This could further exacerbate the risks described above._**

We have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our
senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), our letter of credit facility (as
amended, the “LC Facility”) and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. We may decide to incur
additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our operations and any judgments or settlements or
for other business purposes. Similarly, if we complete the proposed spin-off of Conifer or continue to sell assets
and do not use the proceeds to repay debt, this could further increase our financial leverage.

Our Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion,
with a $300 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. Based on our eligible receivables, $808 million was
available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019. Our LC Facility provides for the issuance
of standby and documentary letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $180 million (subject to
increase to up to $200 million). At June 30, 2019, we had $190 million of cash borrowings outstanding under the
Credit Agreement, and we had $102 million of standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate under the
Credit Agreement and the LC Facility. If new indebtedness is added or our leverage increases, the related risks
that we now face could intensify.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The protections provided in the notes are limited, and we may take actions that could adversely affect the_**
**_notes._**

Our currently outstanding senior unsecured notes and senior secured notes are not rated investment grade by
either S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s Investors Services, and the same will be true for the notes in this offering.
The indentures governing the notes will contain covenants that will not limit the amount of debt we may incur
and will impose only limited restrictions on the security we may provide for future debt. We may decide to incur
additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our operations and any judgments or settlements or
for other business purposes, and our incurrence of any such additional debt may have an adverse effect on our
credit rating and the priority of claims of holders of the notes. That additional debt, if incurred, could be held by a
number of creditors, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes.

The indentures governing the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will restrict our ability
and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

   - incur liens;

   - provide subsidiary guarantees;

   - consummate asset sales;

   - enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or

   - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, other than in certain transactions between
one or more of our wholly owned subsidiaries and us.

20


-----

These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital
expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or
otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.

In addition, these restrictions will be subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In
particular, there will be no restrictions on our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional
unsecured indebtedness (as described above), make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in
respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock or enter into transactions with affiliates or make
advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).

We depend on funds from our subsidiaries, which affects our ability to obtain funds to meet our debt service
obligations.

We hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries.
As a result, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries. Moreover, we are
dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service
and other obligations, including payment on the notes. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make
other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and
restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries.

Our less than wholly owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash
to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to
service their respective debt obligations, including in respect of the notes.

**_We may be unable to purchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of a “change of control” (as specified in “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders”) you may require us to purchase all or any part of your notes at 101% of the aggregate_
principal amount of notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our Credit Agreement may restrict our
ability to repurchase the notes under these circumstances and any of our future debt agreements may also limit
our ability to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event. Accordingly, we may not be
able to satisfy our obligations to purchase your notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under the
indebtedness with such restrictions. We cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to purchase
your notes, particularly as that change of control event may trigger a similar repurchase requirement for, or result
in the acceleration of, other indebtedness.

**_There is no public market for the notes, and you cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for_**
**_the notes._**

The notes of each series are a new issue of securities with no established trading market, and we do not
intend to list them on any securities exchange. Certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend
to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to
do so, and any initial purchaser may cease its market-making activities at any time. As a result, you cannot be
sure that an active trading market will develop for the notes, or for any of the exchange notes (as defined and
described under “Registration Rights”) exchanged for any notes pursuant to any exchange offer.

The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our results of
operations and financial condition, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a
market in the notes and other factors. An active or liquid trading market for the notes may not develop.

**_Resale of the notes is restricted, which could limit the liquidity or affect the price of the notes._**

We have not registered the notes or the subsidiary guarantees for the First Lien Notes under the Securities
Act or any state securities laws. Neither the notes nor the subsidiary guarantees, with respect to the First Lien

21


-----

Notes, may be offered or sold in the United States, unless they are registered (including pursuant to the
registration rights agreement) or the offer or sale is made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of
notes comply with applicable securities laws. These restrictions could limit the liquidity or affect the price of the
notes. See “Registration Rights” and “Notice to Investors.”

**_The value of the Collateral securing the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair
market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general
economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be
dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such
time, the timing and the manner of the sale, and the availability of buyers. By its nature, portions of the Collateral
may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds
from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes.

There may not be sufficient Collateral to pay off all amounts due under the notes, our LC Facility and our
existing and future notes that are secured on the same basis as the notes.

Consequently, liquidating the Collateral securing the notes may not result in sufficient proceeds to pay some
or all amounts due under the notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts
due on the notes and our existing and future debt and other obligations that are secured on the same basis as the
first lien notes, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral)
would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our remaining assets.

**_Your security interest in the capital stock and other ownership interests of our subsidiaries securing the notes_**
**_will automatically be released and such capital stock and other ownership interests will no longer constitute_**
**_Collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock and other ownership interests would require the filing_**
**_of separate financial statements with the SEC._**

The notes will be secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of our
Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries, as defined and described under “Description of the Notes—Definitions.” Under
the SEC regulations in effect as of the Issue Date of the notes, if the par value, book value as carried by us, or
market value (whichever is greatest) of the capital stock and other ownership interests of an affiliate pledged as
part of the Collateral is greater than or equal to 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then
outstanding, such a subsidiary would be required to provide separate financial statements to the SEC if (and only
if) these regulations are applicable to us as a result of the notes. Therefore, the indenture governing the notes and
the Collateral documents will provide that any capital stock and other ownership interests of any subsidiary will
be excluded from the Collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock or other ownership interests to
secure the notes of any series would cause such subsidiary to be required to file separate financial statements
with the SEC pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (as in effect from time to time). As a result, if we register
the notes of any series as described under “Registration Rights,” holders of the notes of such series could lose a
portion or all of their security interest in the capital stock or other ownership interests of one or more of our
subsidiaries during the period in which they hold the notes of such series.

**_The ability of the Collateral trustee to foreclose on the Collateral securing the notes may be limited pursuant_**
**_to bankruptcy laws._**

The notes and subsidiary guarantees will be secured, together with certain of our existing and future secured
debt and other obligations, by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of our
Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries, as defined and described under “Description of the Notes—Definitions.” The

right of the Collateral trustee for the notes, as a secured party under the pledge agreement and the collateral trust
agreement for the benefit of itself and the holders of the notes, to foreclose upon and sell the Collateral upon the
occurrence of a payment default is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable
bankruptcy laws, including the automatic stay provision contained in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Under applicable federal bankruptcy laws, a secured creditor is prohibited from foreclosing upon or
repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such
a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under certain circumstances).
Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit a debtor to continue to retain and use collateral
even though that debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments as long as the secured creditor is
afforded “adequate protection” of its interest in the collateral. Although the precise meaning of the term
“adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, it is intended in general to protect a secured creditor
against any diminution in the value of the creditor’s interest in its collateral.

Accordingly, the bankruptcy court may find that a secured creditor is “adequately protected” if, for example,
the debtor makes certain cash payments or grants the creditor liens on additional or replacement collateral as
security for any diminution in the value of the collateral occurring for any reason during the pendency of the
bankruptcy case.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
powers of a bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the Collateral trustee could foreclose upon or
sell the Collateral or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in
payment or loss of value of the Collateral following the commencement, and during the pendency, of a
bankruptcy case. Furthermore, if a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the notes and our other debt and obligations that are secured on a pari passu basis with
the notes, holders of the notes would hold “under-secured claims.” Applicable federal bankruptcy laws do not
permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for “under-secured claims” during a debtor’s
bankruptcy case. In addition, the Collateral trustee’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on your behalf may be
subject to lack of perfection, the consent of third parties, prior liens and practical problems associated with the
realization of the Collateral trustee’s security interest in the Collateral.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void subsidiary guarantees. Pursuant_**
**_to such statutes, courts could require holders of the notes to return payments received from the Subsidiary_**
**_Guarantors._**

Under federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, if, among other
things, any Subsidiary Guarantor, at the time it incurred the debt evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee:

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the subsidiary guarantee; or

   - issued the subsidiary guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its present or future
creditors; and, in either case;

   - was insolvent or rendered insolvent as a result of issuing the subsidiary guarantees;

   - was engaged in a business or transaction for which that Subsidiary Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

   - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they
matured,

then the subsidiary guarantee of that Subsidiary Guarantor could be voided, or claims by holders of the notes
under that subsidiary guarantee could be subordinated to all other debts of that Subsidiary Guarantor. In addition,
any payment by that Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its subsidiary guarantee could be required to be returned to
that Subsidiary Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of that Subsidiary Guarantor.

23


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a Subsidiary Guarantor would be
considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of all of its
assets at a fair valuation;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

**_The Collateral securing the notes may be diluted under certain circumstances, which could affect the value of_**
**_the notes or your ability to recover amounts due._**

The lien on the Collateral securing the notes will rank pari passu with the liens securing our 4.625% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2024 and obligations outstanding under our LC Facility. The Collateral that will
secure this indebtedness may secure additional senior indebtedness or other obligations that we or certain of our
subsidiaries incur in the future, subject to restrictions on our or their ability to incur debt and liens under the
Credit Agreement, the LC Facility and our indentures. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any
increase in the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the Collateral.

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and joint_**
**_ventures and, accordingly, your ability to realize on the assets of those entities may be limited._**

The notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will have priority as to the
assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any non-guarantor
subsidiaries, these subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their
trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us.

The notes will not be guaranteed by or secured by a pledge of the capital stock or other ownership interests
of any of our current or future (i) non-U.S. subsidiaries, (ii) U.S. subsidiaries that do not own or operate a
hospital and that do not have a direct or indirect equity ownership interest in a subsidiary that owns or operates a
hospital, or (iii) non-wholly owned subsidiaries whose organizational documents or related joint venture or
similar agreements would (A) prohibit such guarantee or pledge without the consent of the equity holders thereof
(other than us or our wholly owned subsidiaries), or (B) upon the making of such guarantee or pledge, trigger in
favor of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned subsidiaries) rights in respect of the capital
stock or other ownership interests of such subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities
and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any
funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the
Subsidiary Guarantors have to receive any assets of any of these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or
reorganization, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those
subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade
creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries.

The Company may from time to time evaluate certain joint venture opportunities with respect to certain of
its hospitals. To the extent the Company enters into such a joint venture opportunity, it may agree to release
certain Collateral consisting of stock in such hospital in connection with that transaction and in certain
circumstances the guarantee by such entity of the notes could also be released. See “Description of the Notes—
_Subsidiary Guarantees.”_

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes will be effectively subordinated to the right of creditors who have a_**
**_security interest in our assets that are not part of the Collateral securing the notes, to the extent of the value of_**
**_those assets._**

The notes and the guarantees will be secured only by the capital stock and other ownership interests of our
Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries and will not be secured by any other assets, including any assets of the Domestic
Hospital Subsidiaries. Subject to the restrictions in our debt agreements, we, including our subsidiaries, may
incur additional indebtedness secured by assets that are not part of the Collateral that will secure the notes. If we
are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under any of our existing or future indebtedness secured by
assets that are not part of the Collateral that will secure the notes, the holders of such indebtedness could declare
all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were
unable to repay such indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could foreclose on such assets to the
exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes at
such time. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by such assets, remaining proceeds, if any,
from the sale of such assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after such indebtedness has
been paid in full.

**_The lien sharing provisions of the collateral trust agreement will limit the rights of holders of the notes with_**
**_respect to the Collateral, even during an event of default._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the terms
of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement covering the Collateral, even during an
event of default. Under the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to or in respect
of the Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the
Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of amendments to, and waivers of past
defaults under documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the majority in the
aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens on the Collateral, including our
4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024 and obligations outstanding under our LC Facility, therefore
the holders of notes will not control such matters.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Agreement**

We have a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) that provides,
subject to borrowing availability, for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion, with a
$300 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. Obligations under the Credit Agreement, which has a
scheduled maturity date of December 4, 2020, are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic wholly owned
hospital subsidiaries and are secured by a first-priority lien on the accounts receivable owned by us and the
subsidiary guarantors. Outstanding revolving loans accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from
0.25% to 0.75% per annum or the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%
per annum, in each case based on available credit. An unused commitment fee payable on the undrawn portion of
the revolving loans ranges from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum based on available credit. Our borrowing
availability is based on a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable, including self-pay accounts. At
June 30, 2019, we had $190 million of cash borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement subject to a
weighted average interest rate of 3.77%, and we had $2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. Based on
our eligible receivables, $808 million was available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019.
We expect to seek an amendment to the Credit Agreement following the offering of the notes, which may include
increasing borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date, among other changes.

**Letter of Credit Facility**

We have a letter of credit facility (as amended, the “LC Facility”) that provides for the issuance of standby
and documentary letters of credit, from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $180 million
(subject to increase to up to $200 million). The maturity date of the LC Facility is March 7, 2021. Obligations
under the LC Facility are guaranteed and secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other
ownership interests of certain of our wholly owned domestic hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis with
our senior secured first lien notes.

Drawings under any letter of credit issued under the LC Facility that we have not reimbursed within three
business days after notice thereof accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% per annum. An
unused commitment fee is payable at an initial rate of 0.25% per annum with a step up to 0.375% per annum
should our secured-debt-to-EBITDA ratio equal or exceed 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter. A fee on
the aggregate outstanding amount of issued but undrawn letters of credit accrues at a rate of 1.50% per annum.
An issuance fee equal to 0.125% per annum of the aggregate face amount of each outstanding letter of credit is
payable to the account of the issuer of the related letter of credit. At June 30, 2019, we had $100 million of
standby letters of credit outstanding under the LC Facility.

**Senior Secured Notes**

As of June 30, 2019, we had $6.07 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes
outstanding. Our 4.750% 2020 Notes will mature on June 1, 2020. Interest on our 4.750% 2020 Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately
preceding May 15 and November 15. Our 6.000% 2020 Notes will mature on October 1, 2020. Interest on our
6.000% 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year to holders of
record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15. Our 4.500% 2021 Notes will mature on
April 1, 2021. Interest on our 4.500% 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of
each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15. Our 4.375% 2021
Notes will mature on October 1, 2021. Interest on our 4.375% 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on
January 1 and July 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding December 15 and June 15.
Our 4.625% Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 15, 2024. Interest on our 4.625% Senior Secured Notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year to holders of record on the immediately

preceding January 1 and July 1. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes offered hereby will be used, after
payment of fees and expenses, together with cash on hand and/or any borrowings under our revolving credit
agreement, to finance the redemption of all of our outstanding 4.750% 2020 Notes, 6.000% 2020 Notes, 4.500%
2021 Notes and 4.375% 2021 Notes.

After giving effect to the Transactions as of June 30, 2019, we would have had $2.91 billion aggregate
principal amount of senior secured second lien notes outstanding. Our 5.125% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes
will mature on May 1, 2025. Interest on our 5.125% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes is payable semi-annually
in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding April 15 and
October 15. Our 6.250% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes will mature on February 1, 2027. Interest on our
6.250% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of
each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15.

All of our existing senior secured first-lien notes are guaranteed by our wholly-owned domestic hospital
subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other
ownership interests of those subsidiaries (the “Collateral”). All of our existing senior secured second-lien notes
are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by our wholly-owned domestic hospital subsidiaries (with certain
exceptions) and secured by a second-priority pledge of the Collateral. All of our senior secured first-lien notes
and the related subsidiary guarantees are the senior secured obligations of us and those subsidiaries that have
provided subsidiary guarantees thereof. Our senior secured first-lien notes rank senior to any subordinated
indebtedness that we or such guaranteeing subsidiaries may incur; they are effectively senior to our and such
guaranteeing subsidiaries’ existing and future junior secured and unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities to
the extent of the value of the Collateral securing the senior secured first-lien notes and the subsidiary guarantees;
they are effectively subordinated to our obligations under our Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing borrowings thereunder; and they are structurally subordinated to all obligations of our
non-guaranteeing subsidiaries to the extent of the assets of such subsidiaries. All of our senior secured secondlien notes and the related subsidiary guarantees are the senior second-lien secured obligations of us and senior
subordinated second-lien secured obligations of those subsidiaries that have provided subsidiary guarantees
thereof. Our senior secured second-lien notes rank senior to any subordinated indebtedness that we may incur and
equal to any subordinated indebtedness that such guaranteeing subsidiaries may incur; they are effectively senior
to our and such guaranteeing subsidiaries’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness and indebtedness and other
liabilities secured on a more junior basis to the extent of the value of the Collateral securing the senior secured
second-lien notes the subsidiary guarantees; and they are effectively subordinated to our obligations under our
Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of the collateral securing borrowings thereunder; and they are
structurally subordinated to all obligations of our non-guaranteeing subsidiaries to the extent of the assets of such
subsidiaries.

The indentures setting forth the terms of our senior secured notes contain provisions limiting our ability to
redeem such senior secured notes and the terms by which we may do so. Certain series of the senior secured
notes may also be redeemed, in whole or in part, at certain redemption prices set forth in the applicable
indentures, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we, at our option, may redeem any series of
our senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or prior
to the date specified in the applicable indenture at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the notes redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the applicable indenture, together with
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date. At any time or from time to time we, at our
option, may redeem any series of our senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes, in
whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date.

In addition, we may be required to purchase for cash all or any part of each series of our senior secured
notes upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the applicable indenture) for a cash purchase
price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such senior secured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

29


-----

**Senior Unsecured Notes**

After giving effect to the Transactions, as of June 30, 2019, we would have had $5.51 billion aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. All of our senior unsecured notes are general senior
unsecured debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured
indebtedness, but are effectively subordinated to our senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien
notes, described above, the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our Credit Agreement and
LC Facility to the extent of the collateral securing such obligations. Our 8.125% Senior Notes will mature on
April 1, 2022. Interest on our 8.125% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1
of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15. Our 6.750% Senior
Notes will mature on June 15, 2023. Interest on our 6.750% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on
June 15 and December 15 of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December
1. Our 7.000% Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2025. Interest on our 7.000% Senior Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately
preceding January 15 and July 15. Our 6.875% Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2031. Interest on our
6.875% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year to holders of
record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1.

We may redeem any series of our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium specified in the applicable
indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

November 6, 2001 (as supplemented from time to time prior to the Issue Date, the “Base Indenture”), as
supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of the Issue Date, with respect to the 2026 First Lien Notes
(the “2026 First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “2026 First
Lien Notes Indenture”), and as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of the Issue Date, with
respect to the 2027 First Lien Notes (the “2027 First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture” and, together with
the Base Indenture, the “2027 First Lien Notes Indenture”) between Tenet, the Subsidiary Guarantors and The

future subordinated indebtedness and, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) securing the
Notes of each series, be effectively senior to Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future
indebtedness secured on a more junior basis and unsecured indebtedness and other unsecured liabilities.

31


-----

We may from time to time, without giving notice to or seeking the consent of the holders of the Notes of
any series, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as
the Notes of such series offered hereby. Any such additional notes having such terms, together with the Notes of
such series offered hereby, will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture, provided that such
additional notes are fungible with the Notes of such series offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The 2026 First Lien Notes will mature on January 1, 2026.

The 2027 First Lien Notes will mature on November 1, 2027.

Interest on the 2026 First Lien Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page hereof and
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2020,
to holders of record on the immediately preceding December 15 and June 15. Interest on the 2026 First Lien
Notes will accrue from the most recent date through which interest has been paid on the notes or, if no interest
has been paid, from the date of original issuance of the notes.

Interest on the 2027 First Lien Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page hereof and
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1,
2019, to holders of record on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15. Interest on the 2027 First Lien
Notes will accrue from the most recent date through which interest has been paid on the notes or, if no interest
has been paid, from the date of original issuance of the notes.

Interest on the Notes of each series will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months. Principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of each series will be payable at our office
or agency maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of holders
of Notes; provided that all payments with respect to Notes as to which the holders have given wire transfer
instructions to the paying agent on or prior to the relevant record date will be required to be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by such holders. Until otherwise designated by
us, our office or agency in New York will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose.

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

The Notes of each series will be guaranteed on a senior first-lien basis by each of our current and future
direct and indirect Subsidiaries organized in a jurisdiction in the United States that (i) owns or operates a hospital
or (ii) has a direct or indirect equity ownership interest in a Subsidiary that owns or operates a hospital, other
than, in each of the cases (i) and (ii), any such Subsidiary that is a non-wholly owned Subsidiary if the
organizational documents thereof or related joint venture or similar agreements, or applicable law, would
(A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned
Subsidiaries) or (B) upon the making of such guarantee, trigger in favor of the equity holders thereof (other than
us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) rights in respect of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary (collectively, the
“Subsidiary Guarantors” and such guarantees, the “Subsidiary Guarantees”). These Subsidiary Guarantees
will be joint and several obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors and will rank equally to the guarantees of the
LC Facility and our other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and all other unsubordinated obligations of the
guarantors. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent that Subsidiary Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law.

The Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released:

(1) with respect to the Notes of any such series upon the full and final payment and performance of all
obligations under the Indenture, with respect to the Notes of such series;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) or upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the

32


-----

assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)
us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture;

(3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction, but only
if (i) the organizational documents thereof or related joint venture or similar agreements, or applicable law,
would (A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly
owned Subsidiaries) or (B) such guarantee would trigger in favor of the equity holders thereof (other than us or
our wholly owned Subsidiaries) rights in respect of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary, and (ii) such Subsidiary
does not guarantee any other capital markets Debt; provided, however, that the preceding clause (ii) shall be
deemed to be satisfied if such Subsidiary is no longer required to guarantee any capital markets Debt;

(4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction that is not prohibited by
the Indenture; or

(5) with respect to the Notes of any such series upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes of such series as provided below under the caption
“—Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

**Security**

The Notes of each series will be secured on a pari passu basis with our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien
Notes due 2024 and obligations outstanding under our LC Facility and secured by a first-priority pledge of the
capital stock and other ownership interests of our Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries (the “Collateral”). The Notes
will not be secured by any hospital or other property or asset of us or our Subsidiaries.

We and the collateral trustee will execute an additional secured debt designation thereby designating the
obligations with respect to the Notes of each series and Subsidiary Guarantees as “First-Priority Stock Secured
**Debt” under the collateral trust agreement that we and certain of the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into with the**
Trustee and the collateral trustee on March 3, 2009 (the “collateral trust agreement”). The effect of such
designation shall be to include the obligations in respect of the Notes of each series and the Subsidiary
Guarantees within the secured obligations covered by the stock pledge agreement dated March 3, 2009 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, including by the first amendment to the pledge agreement dated
May 8, 2009, the second amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 15, 2009, the pledge amendment dated
May 15, 2013, the pledge amendment dated October 1, 2013, the third amendment to the pledge agreement dated
March 7, 2014, the fourth amendment to the pledge agreement dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment
dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment dated October 5, 2015, the fifth amendment to the pledge
agreement dated December 1, 2016, the sixth amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 14, 2017, the
seventh amendment to the pledge agreement dated February 5, 2019 and an eighth amendment to be dated as of
the Issue Date, the “pledge agreement”) on a first priority basis to the obligations covered by the pledge
agreement on the Issue Date. The pledge agreement defines the terms of the pledges that secure the Notes of each
series. These pledges will secure the payment and performance when due of all of our obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes of each series as provided in the pledge agreement. We, the Subsidiary Guarantors and
the collateral trustee will execute an amendment to the pledge agreement, to be dated the date of the Issue Date
(the “pledge amendment”).

The collateral trust agreement sets forth the terms on which the Collateral will be received, held,
administered, maintained and enforced and the terms on which the proceeds of all Liens upon the Capital Stock
pledged as collateral at any time in respect of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior
Stock Secured Debt shall be distributed, in trust for the benefit of the present and future holders of the FirstPriority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt.

33


-----

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the terms
of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement, even during an event of default. Under
the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to or in respect of the Collateral,
including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to
control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of amendments to, and waivers of past defaults under
documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the majority in the aggregate
principal amount of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens on the Collateral.

So long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and
conditions, we and our Subsidiaries will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments
made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by us and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights
pertaining to the Collateral pledged by us.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default or event of default:

(1) all of our rights to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will cease, and all such rights will
become vested in the collateral trustee, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the sole right to exercise
such voting and other consensual rights;

(2) all of our rights to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to
the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other payments will be paid to the collateral
trustee; and

(3) the collateral trustee may sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms
of the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement. The collateral trustee in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and the collateral trust agreement will distribute all funds distributed under the pledge
agreement and the collateral trust agreement and received by the collateral trustee for the benefit of the holders of
the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt.

The collateral trust agreement governs the terms on which the Collateral may be disposed of, including, but
not limited to, the terms on which all or any portion of the Collateral may be released from the Liens created by
the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and the terms on which the Collateral may be foreclosed
upon following a default or event of default.

The pledge of the Capital Stock of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary as it relates to the Notes of any series
and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be released:

(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes
of such series;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including
by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)
us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture;

(3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including by
way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction, but only with respect
to the Capital Stock sold in such transaction or as otherwise contemplated by the definition of Permitted Joint
Venture Transaction;

(4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture;

(5) in respect of pledged Capital Stock owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor has
been released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

34


-----

(6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes of such series as
provided below under the caption “—Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

We will comply with the applicable provisions of TIA §314.

To the extent applicable, we will cause TIA § 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA § 314(d), relating to the
release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be
subjected to the Lien of the security documents, to be complied with. Any certificate or opinion required by TIA
§ 314(d) may be made by an officer of Tenet except in cases where TIA § 314(d) requires that such certificate or
opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent engineer, appraiser or other
expert selected by Tenet.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, we will not be required to comply with
all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) if we determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms
of TIA § 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff,
including “no action” letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a
series of released collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that we file a registration statement with respect to any of the
Notes of a series as described under “Registration Rights” and such registration statement is declared effective by
the SEC, the Collateral securing the Notes of such series will not include any Capital Stock and any other
securities of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other
securities results in us being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but
only to the extent necessary not to be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in
existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes of such series affected; provided that neither we nor any
Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose
of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, in
the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is
replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the
filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of
ours due to the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock secures the Notes of such series affected thereby, and
such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of
such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes of such
series affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long
as required not to be subject to such requirement. In such event, the pledge agreement may be amended or
modified, without the consent of any holder of the Notes of such series, to the extent necessary to release the
security interests in favor of the collateral trustee on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer
constitute part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or
regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock
to secure the Notes of a series in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other
governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, and such law, rule or regulation is
applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will
automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series but only to the extent
necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement.

The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Liens we can create on the Collateral securing the Notes as
well as on our other assets as described under the caption “—Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries—
_Limitations on Liens.” The Credit Agreement permits us to refinance our existing unsecured Senior Debt through_
the issuance of various forms of debt, including secured debt. Under the Credit Agreement, we may refinance
unsecured Senior Debt with secured debt if the secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) after
giving pro forma effect to such refinancing would be less than 4.0 to 1.0 for the most recently ended four
consecutive fiscal quarters.

At any time or from time to time prior to March 1, 2022, we, at our option, may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the 2026 First Lien Notes issued under the Indenture, with the net cash proceeds of
one or more Qualified Equity Offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of the 2026

redemption and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing of any such Qualified Equity Offering.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Notes will not be subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund provisions.

**Selection and Notice of Redemption**

If less than all of the Notes of a series are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes of such series for
redemption will be made according to applicable depository procedures; provided that Notes of series with a
principal amount of $2,000 will not be redeemed in part.

We will deliver a notice of redemption at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each holder of the Notes of a series to be redeemed. If any Notes of series are to be redeemed in part only, the
notice of redemption that relates to such Notes of such series will state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. A replacement Note of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note of such series.

Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease
to accrue on the Notes of a series or portions thereof called for redemption.

Any notice of an optional redemption may, at Tenet’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an equity offering, other offering, incurrence of
indebtedness, or other corporate transaction or event and notice of any redemption in respect thereof may be
given prior to the completion thereof and may be partial as a result of only some of the conditions being satisfied;
provided, however, that any such conditions precedent shall be set forth in the notice of redemption and that such
notice shall state that, in Tenet’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by Tenet in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived
by Tenet in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries**

**_Limitations on Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that neither we nor any of our Subsidiaries will issue, incur, create, assume or
guarantee (collectively, “incur”) with respect to any specified person (as defined in the Indenture), any debt of
such person in respect of borrowed money, including guarantees (as defined in the Indenture) related thereto
(“Debt”) secured by Liens upon property or assets (including the Collateral), unless at the time of and after
giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt, the aggregate amount of all such secured debt (including the
aggregate principal amount of Notes of each series outstanding at such time) shall not exceed the greater of (x)
$9.5 billion and (y) the amount which would cause the Secured Debt Ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0. If any such
secured debt (other than Permitted Credit Agreement Debt) is secured by property or assets other than the
Collateral, we must equally and ratably secure the Notes of each series with, or prior to, such Debt; provided that
up to $500.0 million of such secured debt (“Other Secured Debt”) is not subject to the equal and ratable security
requirement in this sentence. To the extent that we or any of our Subsidiaries incur any additional Debt permitted
under this restriction (other than Other Secured Debt) that is secured by a Lien (pari passu to the Lien securing
the Notes) or junior Lien on any property or assets (which we are permitted to do, subject to the foregoing
limitation), such Liens shall be subject to the collateral trust agreement.

37


-----

The foregoing restriction will not apply to any of the following:

   - Liens securing Permitted Credit Agreement Debt;

   - Liens in favor of us or a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary;

   - Liens existing on the Issue Date;

   - certain Liens to governmental entities;

   - Liens incurred within 90 days (or any longer period, not in excess of one year, as permitted by law),
after acquisition of the related property arising solely in connection with the transfer of tax benefits in
accordance with Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;

   - any substitution or replacement of any Lien referred to above, provided that the property encumbered by
any substitute or replacement Lien is similar in nature and value to the property encumbered by the Lien
that is being replaced, as determined in good faith by an officer of the Company; and

   - any extension, renewal or replacement of any Lien referred to above or any Lien incurred in compliance
with the first paragraph above, provided the amount secured is not increased and it relates to the same
property.

**_Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions_**

The Indenture will provide that neither we nor any of our Subsidiaries will enter into any Sale and LeaseBack Transaction with another Person, other than us or one of our Subsidiary Guarantors, unless:

   - we or any of our Subsidiaries could incur the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction secured by a Lien on the property to be leased in compliance with the covenant described
under the caption “—Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries—Limitations on Liens”; and

   - we comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
_Asset Dispositions.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we and any of our Subsidiaries may enter into any Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction, provided that the aggregate Attributable Debt in respect of all such Sale and Lease-Back
Transactions does not exceed the greater of (x) $650.0 million and (y) 5% of our Consolidated Total Assets.

**_Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees by Subsidiaries_**

The Indenture will provide that we will not permit any of our Subsidiaries to guarantee any of our Debt
(other than pursuant to any extension, renewal or replacement of any Debt that was so guaranteed that does not
increase the amount of our Debt that is so guaranteed), unless at the time of and after giving effect to the issuance
of such Debt, the aggregate amount of all such guaranteed Debt (including the aggregate principal amount of
Notes of each series outstanding at such time) shall not exceed the greater of (x) $12.0 billion or (y) 5.0 times the
aggregate amount of EBITDA for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of
determination; provided that, unless the Notes of each series are secured by substantially all the property and
assets (other than accounts receivable and cash) of the guarantors on a first-priority basis, the aggregate amount
of all such Debt guaranteed by guarantees that are not subordinated to the guarantees of the Notes (including the
aggregate principal amount of Notes of each series outstanding at such time but excluding guarantees of
Permitted Credit Agreement Debt) shall not exceed the greater of (a) $9.5 billion and (b) taking into account only
First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt instead of all Secured Debt, 4.0 times
the aggregate amount of EBITDA for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of
determination. The foregoing restriction will not prohibit the issuance of guarantees by any of our Subsidiaries in
respect of Permitted Credit Agreement Debt. For purposes of the foregoing restriction, Debt and EBITDA shall
be calculated on a pro forma basis consistent with the definition of “Secured Debt Ratio.”

38

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Indenture will provide that we shall cause each newly created or acquired direct or indirect Subsidiary
organized in a jurisdiction in the United States that (i) owns or operates a hospital or (ii) has a direct or indirect
equity ownership interest in a Subsidiary that owns or operates a hospital, other than, in each of the cases (i) and
(ii), any such Subsidiary that is a non-wholly owned Subsidiary if the organizational documents thereof or related
joint venture or similar agreements, or applicable law, would (A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of
the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) or (B) upon the making of such
guarantee, trigger in favor of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) rights in
respect of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee the Notes of each series.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that we may not consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all
of our properties and assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person, unless:

   - we are the surviving corporation or the successor is a corporation organized and validly existing under
the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on all the Notes of each series and the due and punctual performance and
observation of our covenants and obligations under the Indenture; and

   - immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice
or lapse of time or both would become an event of default, has occurred and is continuing under the
Indenture.

The Indenture will also provide that each Subsidiary Guarantor may not, and the Company will not permit
any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person, unless:

   - such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the successor is a corporation organized and
validly existing under the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes all of the
obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Subsidiary Guarantee, except in a transaction where the Subsidiary Guarantee is released; and

   - immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice
or lapse of time or both would become an event of default, has occurred and is continuing under the
Indenture;

provided, that a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to, or merge with or into, any other Subsidiary in connection with a Permitted Joint
Venture Transaction.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Notes of a series will have the right to require
us to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that
holder’s Notes of such series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the
terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, we will offer a payment in cash (the “Change of
**Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series repurchased plus**
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes of such series repurchased, to the date of purchase.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, we will deliver a notice to each holder describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes of each series

39


-----

on the Change of Control Payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date of such Change of Control, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture
and described in such notice. We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of each series pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
change of control provisions of the Indenture, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the change of control provisions of the Indenture,
by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment date, we will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes of each series or portions of Notes of such series properly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes of each series or portions of Notes of such series properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes of each series properly accepted together with
an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series or portions of Notes of such
series being purchased by us.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes of a series properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Notes of such series, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to
be transferred by book entry) to each holder Notes of such series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Notes of such series surrendered, if any; provided that each such Notes of such series issued for
surrendered but unpurchased Notes of such series will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000 in excess thereof. We will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon
as practicable after the Change of Control Payment date.

The provisions described above that require us to make a Change of Control Offer following a change of
control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable to the change of
control event. Except as described above with respect to a change of control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the Notes of a series to require that we repurchase or redeem the Notes of
such series in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes of a series
properly tendered and not validly withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon
such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of
the Change of Control Offer.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of us and our Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes
of a series to require us to repurchase its Notes of such series as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of less than all of the assets of us and our Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or
group may be uncertain.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes of a
series as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series.

40


-----

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this
covenant, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or
regulations.

The agreements governing our other debt contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of
certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control, and future agreements may contain
prohibitions on repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the Notes of each series. The exercise by the
holders of Notes of a series of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes of such series upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are
prohibited from purchasing Notes of a series, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders to the purchase of
such Notes of such series or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not
obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes of any series. In
that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes of a series would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other debt.

Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes of a series upon a repurchase may be limited by our
then-existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may be unable to purchase
_the notes upon a change of control.”_

**_Asset Dispositions_**

We will not, and will not permit any of our Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) we or such Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the
fair market value, as determined in good faith by us, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by us or such Subsidiary is in the form of cash or
cash equivalents;

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by us or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent we elect (or are required by the terms of any Debt), to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase
Senior Debt of ours or of a Subsidiary Guarantor or Debt of a Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (in
each case other than Debt owed to us or one of our Subsidiaries) within one year from the later of the date of
such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; or

(B) to the extent we elect, to acquire Additional Assets within one year from the later of the date of such
Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and

(4) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses
(3)(A) or (3)(B), such balance is applied by us or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, to make an offer to the
holders of the Notes of each series (and to holders of other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) to purchase Notes
of such series (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to and subject to the conditions
contained in the Indenture;

_provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Debt pursuant to_
clause (3)(A) or (4) above, we or such Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Debt and shall cause the related
loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid or purchased; provided, further, however, that, in the case of clause (3)(B) above, a binding commitment

41


-----

shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment so long
as we or such Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Available
Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “acceptable
**commitment”); provided, further that if any acceptable commitment is later canceled or terminated for any**
reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall be applied pursuant to
clause (4) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, we and such Subsidiaries will not be
required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent that
the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions subject to the preceding paragraph which is not
applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph exceeds $100.0 million. Pending application of Net
Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash may be used in any other manner not
prohibited by the Indenture.

For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:

(1) the assumption or discharge of Debt or other liabilities of ours or any Subsidiary and the release of us
or such Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities or other obligations received by us or any Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted
by us or such Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Disposition, to the extent of the cash received in
that conversion;

(3) Additional Assets; and

(4) Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by us or any of our Subsidiaries in such Asset
Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this proviso that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Consolidated
Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect
to subsequent changes in value.

In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of any Notes of any series (and other
First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), we will purchase the Notes of such series tendered pursuant to an offer by us
for the Notes of such series (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) at a purchase price of 100% of
their principal amount (or, in the event such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt was issued with significant
original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest
(or, in respect of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, such other price, not to exceed 100%, as may be
provided for by the terms of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) in accordance with the procedures
(including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If there remains a balance of Net
Available Cash after purchasing all securities tendered, then such balance may be used in any manner not
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available
Cash allotted to their purchase, we will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round
denominations, which in the case of the Notes of a series will be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or
any greater integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We shall not be required to make such an offer to
purchase Notes of each series (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to this covenant if the Net
Available Cash available therefor is less than $100.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for
purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any
subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be
deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer.

We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of any Notes of any series pursuant to

42


-----

this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
this covenant, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or
regulations. The agreements governing our other debt contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions
of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Disposition, and future agreements may contain
prohibitions on repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the Notes of each series. The exercise by the
holders of Notes of a series of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes of such series upon an Asset
Disposition could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Disposition itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs at a time when we are
prohibited from purchasing Notes of a series, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders to the purchase of
such Notes of such series or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not
obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes of such series. In
that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes of such series would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other debt. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the
holders of Notes of a series upon a repurchase may be limited by our then-existing financial resources.

**_SEC Reports_**

If, at any time, we are no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any
reason, we will nevertheless continue to file with the SEC for public availability within the time periods that
would have been applicable if we were subject to such reporting requirements:

(1) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and
10-K if we were required to file such reports; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if we were required to
file such reports.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations
applicable to such reports. Each annual report on Form 10-K will include a report on our consolidated financial
statements by our independent registered public accounting firm.

**Events of Default**

Under the Indenture of each series, each of the following constitutes an event of default with respect to the
Notes of such series:

   - failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes of such series, at maturity or otherwise;

   - failure to pay any interest on the Notes of such series when due, continued for 30 days;

   - the failure by us for 30 days after notice to comply with the provisions described under the caption
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” with respect to the notes of such series;

   - failure to perform, or the breach of, any of our other covenants in the Indenture or the Notes of such
series, continued for 90 days after written notice;

   - with respect to any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $100.0 million, (a) the security
interest under the pledge agreement, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason
other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the pledge agreement and any other
security document; (b) any security interest created under the pledge agreement, under such other
security document or under such Indenture is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction; or (c) we or any Subsidiary asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction,
that any security interest is invalid or unenforceable;

43


-----

   - any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the notes of such series of a “significant subsidiary” or a group
of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a “significant subsidiary” (as “significant
subsidiary” is defined under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for
any reason be asserted in writing by any Subsidiary Guarantor or us not to be, in full force and effect
and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated by the Indenture with
respect to the notes of such series and any such Subsidiary Guarantee; or

   - certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur with respect to us, a Subsidiary
Guarantor that is a “significant subsidiary” or a group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together,
would constitute a “significant subsidiary.”

In addition to the events of default set forth above, an event of default will be deemed to have occurred with
respect to the Notes of each series in the event of a failure to pay at maturity or the acceleration of our
indebtedness or indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor having an aggregate principal amount in excess of the
greater of $100.0 million or 5% of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets under the terms of the instrument under
which that indebtedness is issued or secured if that indebtedness is not discharged or the acceleration is not
annulled within 10 days after written notice.

If any event of default with respect to the Notes of a series occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding, by written notice to us
and to the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of the Notes of such series to be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Notes of each series will automatically and without any
action by the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable. After any such acceleration, but
before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of any Notes of a series then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration
if all events of default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal of or interest on the Notes of such
series, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee in case an event of default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it. Subject to such provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee, the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of a series then outstanding will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any remedy available to the Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes of such series.

No holder of a Note of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless:

   - such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing event of default with respect
to the Notes of such series;

   - the holders of at least 25% in the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series then outstanding
have made written request, and such holder or holders have offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as Trustee; and

   - the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding and the Trustee has not received from the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding a direction
inconsistent with such request within 60 days after such notice, request and offer.

Such limitations, however, do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note of a series for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of or interest on such Note of such series on or after its due date.

44


-----

**Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

We may elect, at our option at any time, to have the provisions of the Indenture relating to defeasance and
discharge of indebtedness and to defeasance of certain restrictive covenants applied to the Notes of a series.

_Defeasance and Discharge. The Indenture will provide that, upon the exercise of our option, we will be_
discharged from all our obligations with respect to the Notes of a series and the Subsidiary Guarantors’
obligations with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantees (except for certain obligations to exchange or register the
transfer of Notes of such series, to replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes of such series, to maintain paying
agencies and to hold moneys for payment in trust), and the Lien on the Collateral shall be released subject to the
conditions precedent below.

_Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The Indenture will provide that, upon the exercise of our option with_
respect to any Notes of a series, we may omit to comply with certain restrictive covenants, including those
described under “ —Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries” and “ —Repurchase at the Option of Holders”
above, and the occurrence of certain events of default will be deemed not to be or result in an event of default, in
each case with respect to such Notes of such series, subject to the conditions precedent below.

In each case, the defeasance provision will be subject to our depositing in trust for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes of a series money or U.S. government obligations, or both, which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized certified public accounting firm, through the payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in
accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and any premium
and interest on such Notes of such series on the stated maturity in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
such Notes of such series. We will also be required, among other things, to deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel to the effect that beneficial owners of such Notes of such series will not recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such deposit, defeasance and discharge were not to occur.

In the event we exercised this option with respect to any Notes of a series and such Notes of such series
were declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default, the amount of money and U.S.
government obligations so deposited in trust would be sufficient to pay amounts due on such Notes of such series
at the time of their respective stated maturities but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on such Notes of
such series upon any acceleration resulting from such event of default. In such case, we would remain liable for
such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture**

The Indenture shall upon company request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of notes herein expressly provided for in the indenture), and the Trustee, at
the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture, when

   - either

       - all Notes of a series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Notes of such series
which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid and (ii) Notes of
such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and
held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust)
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

       - all such Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one
year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the

45


-----

Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of
the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such
deposit (in the case of Notes of such series which have become due and payable) or to the stated
maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;

   - the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and

   - the Company has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture of each series, the Notes of a
series and any related Subsidiary Guarantee may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes of such series), and any existing default or
compliance with certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture may be waived with the consent of the holders of
a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes of such series (including consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for such Notes of such series).

Without the consent of each holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes of
a series held by a non-consenting holder):

   - reduce the principal or change the fixed maturity of such Note of such series;

   - reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest on such Note of such series;

   - waive a default or event of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such
Notes of such series (except a rescission of acceleration of such Notes of such series by the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes of such series and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

   - change the place of payment of such Note of such series or make such Note of such series payable in
money other than that stated in the Note of such series;

   - impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Note of
such series;

   - make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past defaults or the rights of
holders of such Notes of such series to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on such Notes of such series;

   - reduce the principal amount of such Notes of such series whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver; or

   - make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions, except to increase the required
percentage or to provide that other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the
consent of the holder of each outstanding Note of such series.

In addition, without the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes of a series
then outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not modify the pledge agreement, any other security
document or the provisions of the Indenture dealing with the pledge or the application of trust moneys, or
otherwise release any Collateral, in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes of such series (as
determined by us in an officer’s certificate delivered to the Trustee) other than in accordance with the Indenture
and the pledge agreement or the security document.

46


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes of a series, we, together with the
Trustee, may amend or supplement the Indenture to:

   - cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, provided that such action does not adversely affect the
holders of the Notes of such series in any material respect;

   - provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Notes of such
series;

   - evidence the assumption of our obligations to holders of the Notes of such series in the case of a merger,
consolidation or sale of assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Limitations on
Us and Our Subsidiaries—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;

   - add covenants for the benefit of the holders of the Notes of such series or to surrender any right or
power conferred upon us;

   - make any change that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture with respect to the
Notes of such series of any such holder in any material respect;

   - add any additional events of default for the benefit of the holders of the Notes of such series;

   - make, complete or confirm any grant of collateral permitted or required by the Indenture with respect to
the Notes of such series or any of the security documents or any release of collateral that becomes
effective as set forth in the Indenture with respect to the Notes of such series or any of the security
documents;

   - establish the form or terms of other series of debt securities as permitted under the Indenture with
respect to the Notes of such series;

   - comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture
with respect to the Notes of such series under the TIA; or

   - appoint a successor Trustee.

Except in certain limited circumstances, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of
determining the holders of Notes of a series entitled to give or take any direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action or to vote on any action under the Indenture, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in such
Indenture. In certain limited circumstances, the Trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders.
If a record date is set for any action to be taken by holders, such action may be taken only by Persons who are
holders of outstanding Notes of a series on the record date. To be effective, the action must be taken by holders
of the requisite principal amount of Notes of such series within a specified period following the record date. For
any particular record date, this period will be 180 days or such shorter period as may be specified by us (or the
Trustee, if it set the record date), and may be shortened or lengthened from time to time, but not beyond 180
days.

**The Trustee**

date,” we, and the Subsidiary Guarantors will, at our own expense, use all commercially reasonable efforts to file
a registration statement, which we refer to as an “exchange offer registration statement,” with respect to a
registered exchange offer, which we refer to as the “exchange offer,” to exchange such notes for replacement
notes with terms identical in all material respects to such notes (we refer to the notes to be issued in the exchange
offer as the “exchange notes”), to cause such exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective by the
SEC under the Securities Act and to consummate such exchange offer, provided that our obligation to file an
exchange offer registration statement with respect to any notes will cease as soon as such notes become freely
tradable.

“Freely tradable” means, with respect to any notes, notes (a) that are eligible to be sold by a person who has
not been our affiliate during the preceding three months without any volume or manner of sale restrictions under
the Securities Act, (b) for which we have provided a certificate to the trustee instructing the trustee that the
restricted legend thereon no longer applies, and (c) that have been assigned an unrestricted CUSIP number.

In accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, notes held by holders who are not
“affiliates” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us will be freely tradable without any volume or
manner of sale restrictions if, among other things, such notes have been held by such holder for at least six
months and we have filed all reports required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during
the 12 months prior to the free trade date.

If we are required to effect an exchange offer, once such exchange offer registration statement has been
declared effective, we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will offer the applicable exchange notes in exchange for
surrender of the applicable notes. We and the Subsidiary Guarantors will keep such exchange offer open for at
least 20 business days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date that notice of such exchange offer is
mailed to holders of the applicable notes. For each note surrendered to us pursuant to such exchange offer, the
holder who surrendered such note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the
surrendered note. Interest on each exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest
was paid on the note surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on such new note, from the
original issue date of such note.

Under existing interpretations of the Securities Act by the SEC contained in several “no-action” letters to
third parties, and subject to the immediately following sentence, we believe that the exchange notes would
generally be freely transferable by holders thereof after the applicable exchange offer without further registration
under the Securities Act (subject to certain representations required to be made by each holder of notes, as set
forth below). However, any holder of notes who is an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
of us or any Subsidiary Guarantor and any holder of notes who intends to participate in such exchange offer for
the purpose of distributing exchange notes (1) will not be able to rely on the interpretation of the staff of the SEC,
(2) will not be able to tender its notes in the exchange offer and (3) must comply with the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any sale or transfer of the notes unless
such sale or transfer is made pursuant to an exemption from such requirements.

In addition, in connection with any resales of exchange notes, any broker dealer, which we refer to as an
“exchanging broker dealer,” that acquires exchange notes in such exchange offer in exchange for notes acquired
for its own account as a result of market making or other trading activities must deliver a prospectus meeting the
requirements of the Securities Act. The SEC has taken the position that exchanging broker dealers may fulfill
their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to those exchange notes with the prospectus contained in the

57


-----

exchange offer registration statement. We will agree to make available for a period of up to 180 days after
consummation of such exchange offer a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act to any
exchanging broker dealer and any other persons with similar prospectus delivery requirements, for use in
connection with any resale of the applicable exchange notes. An exchanging broker dealer or any other person
that delivers such a prospectus to purchasers in connection with such resales will be subject to certain of the civil
liability provisions under the Securities Act and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights
agreement (including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder).

Each holder of notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange notes for exchange notes
in the applicable exchange offer will be required to make certain representations, including representations that
(1) any exchange notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (2) it has no
arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) of the exchange notes, (3) it is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
of us, and (4) it is not acting on behalf of any person who could not truthfully make the foregoing
representations.

Although we intend to cause the notes of each series to become freely tradable on or prior to the free trade
date or consummate such exchange offer on the terms and timetable described above, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to do so. In the event that the notes of any series do not become freely tradable on or prior to the
free trade date, the interest rate borne by the notes of such series will be increased by one quarter of one percent
per annum for the first 90-day period and thereafter it will be increased by an additional one quarter of one
percent per annum for each 90-day period that elapses; provided that the aggregate increase in such annual
interest rate may in no event exceed one percent. Such additional interest will not accrue for our failure to
provide a certificate to the trustee instructing it that the restricted legend on the notes no longer applies unless we
have received a request to do so by a holder of the applicable notes or the trustee on or after the 380th day after
the Issue Date; provided that if we receive such a request on or after the fifth business day immediately preceding
the free trade date and the restricted legend on the applicable notes has not been removed by the close of business
on the fifth business day thereafter, additional interest will accrue on such notes until (1) such notes become
freely tradable or (2) such exchange offer registration statement has been declared effective and the exchange
offer has been consummated for such notes. Once all outstanding notes of a series have become freely tradable or
all notes of such series tendered into such exchange offer have been exchanged for exchange notes that are freely
tradable (other than exchange notes held by exchanging broker dealers), special interest will cease to accrue.

This summary of certain provisions of the registration rights agreements does not purport to be complete
and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the complete provisions of the registration rights agreements,
copies of which we will make available to holders of notes upon request.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**The global notes**

The notes of each series will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form, without interest
coupons (the “global notes”), as follows:

   - notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (each a “QIB”) under Rule
144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global note;

   - notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented
by the Regulation S global note; and

   - any notes sold in the secondary market to institutional accredited investors will be represented by the
Institutional Accredited Investor global note.

Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for The Depository
Trust Company (“DTC”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with
DTC (“DTC participants”) or persons who hold interests through DTC participants. We expect that under
procedures established by DTC:

   - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal
amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers;
and

   - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of
those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of
DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial
interests in the global note).

Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear Bank
S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on behalf of the owners of such interests.

Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global notes directly through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in
those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S global note through organizations other
than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC
participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for
the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants.

Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form except
in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will
be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.”

**Exchanges among the global notes**

The distribution compliance period required by Regulation S (the “Distribution Compliance Period”) will
begin on the Issue Date and end 40 days after the Issue Date. During the Distribution Compliance Period,
beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation
S, persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or institutional accredited
investors.

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note.
Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance Period, and to
which global note the transfer is being made, the trustee may require the seller to provide certain written
certifications in the form provided in the applicable indenture. In addition, in the case of a transfer of interests to

59


-----

the Institutional Accredited Investor global note, the trustee may require the buyer to deliver a representation
letter in the form provided in the applicable indenture that states, among other things, that the buyer is not
acquiring notes with a view to distributing them in violation of the Securities Act.

A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another
global note will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to
beneficial interests in the other global note.

Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the applicable notes will be issued, upon our satisfaction
that the notes are no longer required to bear a restricted Securities Act legend in order to maintain compliance
with the Securities Act, we may, at our option, take the necessary action such that holders of notes bearing a
restricted Securities Act legend may automatically exchange such notes for notes that do not bear a restricted
Securities Act legend at any time on or after the 366th calendar day after the Issue Date of the notes.

**Book-entry procedures for the global notes**

All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. None of the Company, the trustee, or the initial purchasers are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

DTC has advised us that it is:

   - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

   - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

   - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

   - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its
participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and
trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available
to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC
participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or
indirect participants in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole
owner or holder of the notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as
provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note:

   - will not be entitled to have notes represented by the global note registered in their names;

   - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and

   - will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indentures for any purpose, including
with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the trustee under the indentures.

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of
DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the indentures (and, if the investor is not a participant or an
indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its
interest).

60


-----

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the notes represented by a global note
will be made by the trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the
trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a
global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global
note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of
those participants or indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be affected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in
same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be affected in the ordinary way
under the rules and operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be affected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as
depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear
or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the
transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send
instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in
the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the
DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that
purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear
or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from
the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement
date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in
the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not
obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we
nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated notes**

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a
beneficial owner of the related notes only if:

   - DTC notifies us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes
and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

   - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is
not appointed within 90 days;

   - we, at our option, notify the trustee that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes; or

   - certain other events provided for in the indenture should occur.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement among Tenet, our Subsidiary Guarantors
and the initial purchasers, Tenet has agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and each of the initial purchasers has
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from Tenet, the principal amount of the notes set forth opposite its
name below:

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The representatives have advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the
offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering
price or any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through
certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial
purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act
or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers
will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or
pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have
made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

62


-----

**New Issues of Notes**

The notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of any of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to
make a market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and
may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of
the trading market for any of the notes. If an active trading market for any of the notes does not develop, the
market price and liquidity of such notes may be adversely affected. If any of the notes are traded, they may trade
at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar
securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2019, which will be
the business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle
in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade notes on the date hereof or in the next business days will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date hereof or in
the next business days should consult their advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

During the period of 30 days from the date hereof, we will not, without the prior written consent of Barclays
Capital Inc., directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell or contract, grant any option for the sale, pledge,
transfer of, or otherwise dispose of, or announce the offering of, or file any registration statement under the
Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of the Company that are similar to any of the notes, or any debt
securities convertible into or exchangeable for debt securities of the Company that are similar to the notes (other
than as contemplated by the purchase agreement and to register the exchange notes (as defined under the section
entitled “Registration Rights”)).

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short
sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are
required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes
in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there
may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales
may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in
the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the representatives will engage in these
transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC
(as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive
2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

from time to time.

refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“Corporations Act”)) has been or will be lodged with the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) or any other governmental agency, in relation to
the offering. This offering memorandum does not constitute a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other
disclosure document for the purposes of Corporations Act, and does not purport to include the information
required for a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other disclosure document under the Corporations Act.

Australia (including an offer or invitation which is received by a person in Australia) and neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisement relating to the notes may be distributed or
published in Australia unless, in each case:

(a) the aggregate consideration payable on acceptance of the offer or invitation by each offeree or invitee
is at least A$500,000 (or its equivalent in another currency, in either case, disregarding moneys lent by
the person offering the notes or making the invitation or its associates) or the offer or invitation
otherwise does not require disclosure to investors in accordance with Part 6D.2 or 7.9 of the
Corporations Act;

(b) the offer, invitation or distribution complied with the conditions of the Australian financial services
license of the person making the offer, invitation or distribution or an applicable exemption from the

directives (including, without limitation, the licensing requirements set out in Chapter 7 of the
Corporations Act); and

(d) the offer or invitation does not constitute an offer or invitation to a person in Australia who is a “retail
client” as defined for the purposes of Section 761G of the Corporations Act; and such action does not
require any document to be lodged with ASIC or the ASX.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Japan**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of
Japan (the “Financial Instruments and Exchange Law”) and each initial purchaser has agreed that it will not offer
or sell any notes, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as
used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the
laws of Japan), or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan,
except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the
Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of
Japan.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Hong Kong**

The notes may not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (i) in
circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance
(Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and
Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances
which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.
32, Laws of Hong Kong) and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the notes may be issued or
may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or
elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong
Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to notes which are or
are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” within the
meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.

-----

Solely for the purposes of its obligations pursuant to sections 309B(1)(a) and 309B(1), we have determined,
and hereby notify all relevant persons (as defined in Section 309A of the SFA), that the notes are “prescribed
capital markets products” (as defined in the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) Regulations 2018)
and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in MAS Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale of Investment
Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on Investment Products).

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Some of the initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, financial
advisory, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our
affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these
transactions. Affiliates of the initial purchasers from time to time have acted or in the future may continue to act
as agents and lenders to us and our affiliates and subsidiaries under our or their respective credit facilities, for
which services they have received or expect to receive customary compensation. Certain of the initial purchasers
or their affiliates have acted as advisors to us in connection with the sale of Conifer. The initial purchasers and/or
affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may hold our existing debt securities that will be redeemed in the
Redemption and as a result may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. Affiliates of certain of
the initial purchasers are agents and/or participants under the LC Facility and our Credit Agreement.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely
hedge (and certain of the other initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may
hedge) their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such
initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The
initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

under the Securities Act) that, prior to such transfer, furnishes to the trustee a signed letter containing certain
representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on transfer of the note (the form of which letter can be
obtained from the trustee) or (vi) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (if available) or any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that

(B) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of

Company and the holder thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY
ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF OR OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, THE ACQUIRER

(B) IT IS AN INSTITUTIONAL “ACCREDITED INVESTOR” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF
RULE 501(a) (1), (2), (3) OR (7) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) (AN “INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED
INVESTOR”); OR

68


-----

(C) IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON (WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION S UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT); AND

(2) AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER, SELL, PLEDGE
OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE OR ANY BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, EXCEPT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ONLY

(A) TO THE COMPANY,

(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT,

(C) TO A PERSON REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL

TRUSTEE) RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE, OR

(F) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH (2)(C) ABOVE OR
(2)(D) ABOVE, A DULY COMPLETED AND SIGNED CERTIFICATE (THE FORM OF WHICH MAY BE
OBTAINED FROM THE TRUSTEE) MUST BE DELIVERED TO THE TRUSTEE. PRIOR TO THE

RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS, CERTIFICATIONS
OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT
THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE
AVAILABILITY OF ANY RULE 144 EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT.

By acceptance of a note or an exchange note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
acquire or hold the notes or the exchange notes constitutes assets of any employee benefit plans that are subject
to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual
retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any
federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions (“Similar Laws”) or
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement
or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the notes and the exchange notes (and the exchange of notes for
exchange notes) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of
the Company, the initial purchasers or any of their affiliates is acting as a fiduciary with respect to such
acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes or exchange notes (or exchange thereof).

69


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes and
exchange notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, plans, individual retirement
accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any federal,
state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions (“Similar Laws”), and
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement
(each, a “Plan”).

**General fiduciary matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes and exchange notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited transaction issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of
the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes or exchange notes by an ERISA
Plan with respect to which the issuer, the initial purchasers, or the guarantors are considered a party in interest or
a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of
Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and
holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company
pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that
neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan
involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration
in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions
will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes and exchange notes should not be purchased or held by any
person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (and the exchange of notes for
exchange notes) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation
of any applicable Similar Laws.

70


-----

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note or an exchange note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire or hold the notes or the exchange notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition,
holding and disposition of the notes and the exchange notes (and the exchange of notes for exchange notes) by
such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Company, the
initial purchasers or any of their affiliates is acting as a fiduciary with respect to such acquisition, holding or
disposition of the notes or exchange notes (or exchange thereof).

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes or
exchange notes (and holding the notes or exchange notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult
with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar
Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

This section summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership,
and disposition of the notes. This summary does not provide a complete analysis of all potential tax
considerations. The information provided below is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(referred to herein as the “Code”), Treasury Regulations issued under the Code, judicial authority and
administrative rulings and practice, all as of the date of this offering memorandum and all of which are subject to
differing interpretations or change, possibly on a retroactive basis. As a result, the tax considerations of
purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes could differ from those described below. This summary deals only
with purchasers who purchase the notes for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which
a substantial amount of the applicable series of notes are sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. It is
expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

This summary does not deal with persons in special tax situations, such as banks or financial institutions,
thrifts, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or investors therein, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt
entities, controlled foreign corporations, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax,
traders or dealers in securities or currencies, U.S. expatriates or former long-term permanent residents, non-U.S.
trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries, persons holding the notes as a position in a “straddle,” “hedge,”
“conversion transaction,” or other integrated transaction for tax purposes, persons subject to special tax
accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code or U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency
is not the U.S. dollar. Further, this discussion does not address the tax consequences under U.S. alternative
minimum tax rules, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws, the tax laws of any U.S. state or locality, any non-U.S. tax
laws, or any tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws. We will not seek a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the matters discussed herein and there can be no assurance
that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Person” means,

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,

   - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia,

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or

   - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be
treated as a U.S. person.

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
U.S. Person. As used herein, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner, other than an entity treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of notes that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of notes, the
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and upon the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the notes and partners in such a
partnership should consult their independent tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
purchasing, holding and disposing of the notes.

72


-----

**Investors should consult their tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership**
**and disposition of the notes, including any U.S. federal tax consequences and the tax consequences under**
**the laws of any foreign, state, local or other taxing jurisdictions and the possible effects on investors of**
**changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.**

**Payments under Certain Events**

We may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay additional amounts in redemption of or otherwise
on the notes in addition to the stated principal amount of and interest on the notes. Although the issue is not free
from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such additional amounts does not
result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury
Regulations.

Our determination that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a holder, unless
such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is
taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position
to that described above, a holder may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes in excess of
stated interest, based upon a comparable yield, regardless of the holder’s method of tax accounting. The
“comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent
payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income.

**Holders of notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being**
**treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes**
**will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.**

**U.S. holders**

_Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a note will generally be includable by a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time
it accrues or is received in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_

Upon the disposition of a note by sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, a U.S.
holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized on the
disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed as ordinary
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously included in income) and (ii) the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of
the note. A U.S. holder’s gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such note for longer than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to certain limitations. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally
taxed at preferential rates.

_Medicare Tax_

A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special category of trusts that is
exempt from such tax, will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. holder’s
“net investment income” (or, in the case of an estate or trust, “undistributed net investment income”) for the
relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder’s “modified adjusted gross income” (or, in the case of

73


-----

an estate or trust, “adjusted gross income”) for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of
individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000 depending on the individual’s circumstances). Net
investment income will generally include interest income and net gains from the disposition of the notes, unless
such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other
than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). A U.S. holder that is an individual,
estate or trust should consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to its income and
gains in respect of its investment in the notes.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, a U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding at the applicable tax rate with respect to
payments of stated interest or the gross proceeds from dispositions (including a redemption or retirement) of
notes, unless the holder (i) is an entity that is exempt from backup withholding and, when required, provides
appropriate documentation to that effect or (ii) timely provides the applicable withholding agent with the social
security number or other taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), certifies that the TIN provided is correct and
that the holder has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding due to underreporting of
interest or dividends, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. In
addition, such payments to U.S. holders that are not otherwise exempt from these rules will generally be subject
to information reporting requirements. A U.S. holder who does not provide the applicable withholding agent with
the correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The
amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. The applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the
IRS the amount of any “reportable payments” and any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required by
the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

**Non-U.S. holders**

_Interest_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of stated interest on a note to
a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided:

   - the interest is not income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business conducted
by the non-U.S. holder (“ECI”);

   - the non-U.S. holder does not actually or constructively (pursuant to the rules of Section 871(h)(3)(C) of
the Code) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock that are
entitled to vote;

   - the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us actually or constructively
through the stock ownership rules under Section 864(d)(4) of the Code;

   - the non-U.S. holder is not a bank that is receiving the interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to
a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business; and

   - the non-U.S. holder satisfies the certification requirements set forth in Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the
Code, as applicable, and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder by giving the applicable
withholding agent an appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable
substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly
completed and duly executed establishing its status as a non-U.S. Person or by other means prescribed
by the Secretary of the Treasury.

If these conditions are not met, interest on the notes paid to a non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to
U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate unless (a) an applicable income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such

74


-----

tax, and the non-U.S. holder claims the benefit of that treaty by providing an appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may
prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed, or (b) the interest is ECI and the non-U.S. holder
complies with applicable certification requirements by providing an appropriate IRS Form W-8ECI (or a suitable
substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and
duly executed.

If the interest on the notes is ECI, the non-U.S. holder generally will be required to pay U.S. federal income
tax on that interest on a net income basis (and the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax described above will not
apply, provided the appropriate statement is provided to us or our paying agent) in the same manner as a U.S.
holder. If, however, a non-U.S. holder is eligible for the benefits of any income tax treaty between the United
States and its country of residence, any interest income that is ECI will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (and
withholding tax if applicable) in the manner specified by the treaty, provided that an appropriate IRS Form W-8
(or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) has been properly
completed and provided by the non-U.S. holder. In addition, a corporate non-U.S. holder may also, under certain
circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate, or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate,
on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.

_Disposition of Notes_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, a non-U.S. holder will generally not be
subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain (other than any amount allocable to accrued and
unpaid interest, which would be treated as interest and subject to the rules discussed above in “—Interest”)
recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes unless:

   - the gain is ECI (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States
permanent establishment); or

   - in the case of a non-U.S. holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the
United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year and certain other requirements are met.

If a non-U.S. holder falls under the first of these exceptions, the holder will be taxed on the net gain derived
from the disposition under the graduated U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to U.S. Persons
generally, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign
corporation, it may also be subject to the branch profits tax described above under “—Interest”, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise.

If an individual non-U.S. holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30%, unless reduced by treaty, on the amount by which the gain
derived from the disposition from sources within the United States exceeds certain capital losses allocable to
sources within the United States for the taxable year of the sale.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to non-U.S. holders the amount of interest paid to
non-U.S. holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the
information returns reporting such interest and withholding (if any) may also be made available to the tax
authorities in the country in which a non-U.S. holder resides or is organized under the provisions of an applicable
income tax treaty. A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding with respect to
payments of interest that we or our paying agent make, provided that the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S.
holder under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.

The payment of the proceeds of the disposition of notes (including a retirement or redemption) to or through
the United States office of a United States or foreign broker will be subject to information reporting and backup

withholding unless the non-U.S. holder provides the certification described above or otherwise establishes an
exemption. The proceeds of a disposition effected outside the United States by a holder of the notes to or through
a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.
However, if that broker is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Person, a controlled foreign corporation,
a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for certain periods is effectively connected
with a trade or business in the United States, or a foreign partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States or that has one or more partners that are U.S. Persons who in the aggregate hold
more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the partnership, information reporting requirements will
apply unless such holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit
against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided it timely furnishes
the required information to the IRS. The applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the IRS the
amount of any “reportable payments” and any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required by the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

A 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (“FATCA”) will generally apply to payments of interest on the notes
made to (i) a foreign financial institution (whether such foreign financial institution is a beneficial owner or an
intermediary), unless such institution undertakes either under an agreement with the Department of Treasury or
an intergovernmental agreement between the jurisdiction in which it is a resident and the U.S. Treasury to
generally identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons and foreign entities with substantial U.S. owners,
annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30% on payments made to non-compliant
foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders or such institution qualifies for an exemption from
these rules or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity (whether such non-financial foreign entity is a beneficial owner
or an intermediary), unless such entity provides the paying agent with a certification that it does not have any
substantial United States owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial United States
owners of the entity and meets certain other specified requirements or such entity qualifies for an exemption
under these rules.

While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or
other disposition of the notes (including retirement or redemption) on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed
U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Although
these recent Treasury regulations are not final, the preamble to these Treasury regulations indicates that taxpayers
may rely on them pending their finalization.

Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA
regulations to the notes.

**The U.S. federal income tax discussion set forth above as to both U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders is**
**included for general information only and may not be applicable depending upon a holder’s particular**
**situation. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal tax consequences to**
**them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, as well as the tax consequences under state,**
**local, foreign and other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.**
