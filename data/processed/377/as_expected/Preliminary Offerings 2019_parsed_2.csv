Although a substantial portion of both our patient volumes and, as result, our revenues has historically been derived from government healthcare programs, reductions to our reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of the ACA have been partially offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals. The President issued an executive order in January 2017 declaring that it is the official policy of his administration to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directing the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law while the ACA remains in effect. The White House also sent a memorandum to federal agencies directing them to freeze any new or pending regulations. In October 2017, the administration announced that reimbursements to insurance companies for ACA cost-sharing reduction plans offered through the health insurance marketplace would be discontinued. CSR payments compensate insurers for subsidizing out-of-pocket costs for low-income enrollees. Without the CSR payments, many insurers increased premiums for plans offered on ACA exchanges and a few withdrew entirely from offering plans on some of the exchanges. In addition, in December 2017, Congress passed and the President signed a tax reform bill into law that, among other things, eliminates the ACA’s individual mandate penalty for not buying health insurance starting in 2019. The Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that eliminating the mandate penalty starting in 2019—and making no other changes to the then-current law—would cause the number of people with health insurance to decrease by 4 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2027. Members of Congress have also proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payer proposals. We cannot predict if or when further modification of the ACA will occur or what action, if any, Congress might take with respect to eventually repealing and possibly replacing the law. Furthermore, there have also been successful judicial challenges to the ACA, including a December 2018 ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional. Because the judge’s order was stayed pending appeal, the decision’s near-term impact on health insurance coverage under the ACA may be limited; however, uncertainty over the future of the ACA has intensified.

We are also unable to predict the impact of administrative, regulatory and legislative changes, and market reactions to those changes, on our future revenues and operations. However, if the ultimate impact is that significantly fewer 6 ----- individuals have private or public health coverage, we likely will experience decreased volumes, reduced revenues and an increase in uncompensated care, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

The laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance. Moreover, under the ACA, the government and its contractors may suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to providers of services “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.” The potential consequences for violating such laws, rules or regulations include reimbursement of government program payments, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, including treble damages, fines, which could be 7 ----- significant, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, or criminal sanctions against current or former employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and our business reputation could suffer. Furthermore, healthcare, as one of the largest industries in the United States, continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local healthcare regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Further changes in the regulatory framework negatively affecting healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we explore outsourcing and offshoring of certain functions unrelated to direct patient care to enhance efficiency, we must ensure that those operations will be compliant with U.S. healthcare industry-specific requirements. In addition, we are required to comply with various federal and state labor laws, rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues. From time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws, rules and regulations. Conifer and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local consumer protection and other laws governing such topics as privacy, financial services, and billing and collections activities. Regulations governing Conifer’s operations are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. In addition, a regulatory determination made by, or a settlement or consent decree entered into with, one regulatory agency may not be binding upon, or preclude, investigations or regulatory actions by other agencies. Conifer’s failure to comply with applicable consumer protection and other laws could result in, among other things, the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), the imposition of fines or refunds, and other civil and criminal penalties, some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations. In addition, Conifer’s failure to comply with the statutes and regulations applicable to it could result in reduced demand for its services, invalidate all or portions of some of Conifer’s services agreements with its clients, give clients the right to terminate Conifer’s services agreements with them or give rise to contractual liabilities, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer’s business. Furthermore, if Conifer or its subsidiaries become subject to fines or other penalties, it could harm Conifer’s reputation, thereby making it more difficult for Conifer to retain existing clients or attract new clients.",,as_expected,2019,85,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Our business and financial results could be harmed if we are alleged to have violated existing regulations or if we fail to comply with new or changed regulations.\nText: Our hospitals, outpatient centers and related healthcare businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, licensure, contractual arrangements, conduct of operations, privacy of patient information, ownership of facilities, physician relationships, addition of facilities and services, and reimbursement rates for services.

The laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance. Moreover, under the ACA, the government and its contractors may suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to providers of services \u201cpending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.\u201d The potential consequences for violating such laws, rules or regulations include reimbursement of government program payments, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, including treble damages, fines, which could be 7 ----- significant, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, or criminal sanctions against current or former employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and our business reputation could suffer. Furthermore, healthcare, as one of the largest industries in the United States, continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local healthcare regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations. Further changes in the regulatory framework negatively affecting healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we explore outsourcing and offshoring of certain functions unrelated to direct patient care to enhance efficiency, we must ensure that those operations will be compliant with U.S. healthcare industry-specific requirements. In addition, we are required to comply with various federal and state labor laws, rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues. From time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws, rules and regulations. Conifer and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local consumer protection and other laws governing such topics as privacy, financial services, and billing and collections activities. Regulations governing Conifer\u2019s operations are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. In addition, a regulatory determination made by, or a settlement or consent decree entered into with, one regulatory agency may not be binding upon, or preclude, investigations or regulatory actions by other agencies. Conifer\u2019s failure to comply with applicable consumer protection and other laws could result in, among other things, the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), the imposition of fines or refunds, and other civil and criminal penalties, some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations.

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"If we are unable to enter into, maintain and renew managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable terms, if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.","The amount of our managed care net patient service revenues, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, from our hospitals and related outpatient facilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $9.2 billion, which represented approximately 65% of our total net patient service revenues. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2018, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from the hospitals and related outpatient facilities in our Hospital Operations and other segment was approximately 89% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with HMOs, insurers offering preferred provider arrangements and other managed care plans, as well as add new facilities to our existing agreements at contracted rates, significantly affects our revenues and operating results. We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various HMOs and PPOs; however, our top ten managed care payers generated 65% of our managed care net patient service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Because of this concentration, we may experience a short or long-term adverse effect on our net operating revenues if we cannot renew, replace or otherwise mitigate the impact of expired contracts with significant payers. Furthermore, any disputes between us and significant managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2018, 61% of our net accounts receivable for our Hospital Operations and other segment was due from managed care payers. Private payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs. Any negotiated discount programs we agree to generally limit our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs.

Private payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs. Any negotiated discount programs we agree to generally limit our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs. Furthermore, the ongoing trend toward consolidation among private managed care payers tends to increase their bargaining power over prices and fee structures. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to renew existing managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on competitive terms. Other healthcare companies, including some with greater financial resources, greater geographic coverage or a wider range of services, may compete with us for these opportunities. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Any material reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services or any significant difficulties in collecting 9 ----- receivables from managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: Yes\nEvidence: Private payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs.\n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.17,It is essential to our ongoing business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialties required to support our services and that we maintain good relations with those physicians.,"The success of our business depends in significant part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of our hospitals and other facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their practices. Physicians are often not employees of the hospitals or surgery centers at which they practice.

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.18,"Our labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.","The operations of our facilities are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, including nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our employed physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining employees, and, like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of critical-care nurses in certain disciplines and geographic areas. As a result, from time to time, we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced employees, make greater investments in education and training for newly licensed medical support personnel, or hire more expensive temporary or contract employees. Furthermore, state-mandated nursestaffing ratios in California affect not only our labor costs, but, if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios, they may also cause us to limit volumes, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues. In general, our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, experienced nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. At December 31, 2018, approximately 26% of the employees in our Hospital Operations and other segment were represented by 14 ----- labor unions. Less than 1% of the employees in our Ambulatory Care and Conifer segments belong to a union.

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.19,"Our hospitals, outpatient centers and other healthcare businesses operate in competitive environments, and competition in our markets can adversely affect patient volumes.","The healthcare business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals and outpatient centers in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer, and, in some cases, our competitors (1) are more established or newer than ours, (2) may offer a broader array of services or more desirable facilities to patients and physicians than ours, and (3) may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer patients, among other things. Furthermore, healthcare consumers are now able to access hospital performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction, as well as standard charges for services, to compare competing providers; if any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are or are perceived to be higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients. Additional quality measures and trends toward clinical or billing transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. In the future, we expect to encounter increased competition from system-affiliated hospitals and healthcare companies, as well as health insurers and private equity companies seeking to acquire providers, in specific geographic markets. We also face competition from specialty hospitals (some of which are physician-owned) and unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel.

We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including protected health information, personally identifiable information, and our proprietary and confidential business performance data. We utilize electronic health records and other information technology in connection with all of our operations, including our billing and supply chain and labor management operations. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems. Although we monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the integrity, security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store, the information technology and infrastructure we use have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance. Attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, security or availability of data we process, transmit or store, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, devices or businesses. While we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of our systems, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient in the future. As 15 ----- cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective protective measures, and we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our information systems and infrastructure, and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. Furthermore, we have an increased risk of security breaches or compromised intellectual property rights as a result of outsourcing certain functions unrelated to direct patient care. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not offset the impact of a material loss event. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. A breach or attack affecting any of these third parties could similarly harm our business. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other healthcare services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of consumer confidence in our industry that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or of the healthcare industry in general, which could result in reduced use of our services. Our networks and technology systems are also subject to disruption due to events such as a major earthquake, fire, hurricane, telecommunications failure, ransomware attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event.

We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including protected health information, personally identifiable information, and our proprietary and confidential business performance data. We utilize electronic health records and other information technology in connection with all of our operations, including our billing and supply chain and labor management operations. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems. Although we monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the integrity, security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store, the information technology and infrastructure we use have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance. Attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, security or availability of data we process, transmit or store, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, devices or businesses. While we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of our systems, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient in the future. As 15 ----- cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective protective measures, and we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our information systems and infrastructure, and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. Furthermore, we have an increased risk of security breaches or compromised intellectual property rights as a result of outsourcing certain functions unrelated to direct patient care. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not offset the impact of a material loss event. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. A breach or attack affecting any of these third parties could similarly harm our business. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other healthcare services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of consumer confidence in our industry that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or of the healthcare industry in general, which could result in reduced use of our services. Our networks and technology systems are also subject to disruption due to events such as a major earthquake, fire, hurricane, telecommunications failure, ransomware attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event. Any breach or system interruption of our information systems or of third parties with access to our sensitive and confidential data could result in: the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of such data; interruptions and delays in our normal business operations (including the collection of revenues); patient harm; potential liability under privacy, security, consumer protection or other applicable laws; regulatory penalties; and negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: Yes\nEvidence: Any breach or system interruption of our information systems or of third parties with access to our sensitive and confidential data could result in: the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of such data; interruptions and delays in our normal business operations (including the collection of revenues); patient harm; potential liability under privacy, security, consumer protection or other applicable laws; regulatory penalties; and negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

These NOL carryforwards will expire in the years 2027 to 2034. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company\u2019s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. (This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws.) These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company\u2019s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by five-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. While we expect to be able to realize our total NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, if an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards.

Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to 16 ----- receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically. In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have “excess readmissions” for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement. Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions (“HACs”), unless the conditions were present at admission. Hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for HACs in the previous year receive reduced Medicare reimbursements. Moreover, the ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions. The ACA also created the CMS Innovation Center to test innovative payment and service delivery models that have the potential to reduce Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care for beneficiaries. Participation in some of these models is voluntary; however, participation in certain bundled payment arrangements is mandatory for providers located in randomly selected geographic locations. Generally, the bundled payment models hold hospitals financially accountable for the quality and costs for an entire episode of care for a specific diagnosis or procedure from the date of the hospital admission or inpatient procedure through 90 days post-discharge, including services not provided by the hospital, such as physician, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health services. Under the mandatory models, hospitals are eligible to receive incentive payments or will be subject to payment reductions within certain corridors based on their performance against quality and spending criteria. In 2015, CMS finalized a five-year bundled payment model, called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, which includes hip and knee replacements, as well as other major leg procedures. Seventeen hospitals in our Hospital Operations and other segment and four of USPI’s surgical hospitals currently participate in the CJR model. In addition, 42 hospitals in our Hospital Operations and other segment and five of USPI’s surgical hospitals participate in the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCIA”) program that became effective October 1, 2018. USPI also holds the CMS contract for four physician group practices participating in the BPCIA program. We cannot predict what impact, if any, these demonstration programs will have on our inpatient volumes, net revenues or cash flows. There is also a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models for healthcare services. Many large commercial payers expect hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.

Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions (\u201cHACs\u201d), unless the conditions were present at admission. Hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for HACs in the previous year receive reduced Medicare reimbursements. Moreover, the ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.

Participation in some of these models is voluntary; however, participation in certain bundled payment arrangements is mandatory for providers located in randomly selected geographic locations. Generally, the bundled payment models hold hospitals financially accountable for the quality and costs for an entire episode of care for a specific diagnosis or procedure from the date of the hospital admission or inpatient procedure through 90 days post-discharge, including services not provided by the hospital, such as physician, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health services.

Our Credit Agreement is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of substantially all of our domestic wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals, and our LC Facility is guaranteed and secured by a first priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis with our existing senior secured notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital market, bank credit and other financing activities, depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. The interest expense associated with our indebtedness offsets a substantial portion of our operating income. During 2018, our interest expense was $1.004 billion and represented 61% of our $1.647 billion of operating income. As a result, relatively small percentage changes in our operating income can result in a relatively large percentage change in our net income and earnings per share, both positively and negatively. In addition: - Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. - We may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business, in the healthcare industry or in the economy generally, or if federal or state governments substantially limit or reduce reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. - Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. - Our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions or other needs. - Our significant indebtedness may result in the market value of our stock being more volatile, potentially resulting in larger investment gains or losses for our shareholders, than the market value of the common stock of other companies that have a relatively smaller amount of indebtedness. - A significant portion of our outstanding debt is either subject to early prepayment penalties, such as “make-whole premiums,” or is not currently callable. As a result, it may be costly to pursue debt repayment as a deleveraging strategy. Furthermore, our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain, and any future debt obligations may contain, covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets.

Your task is to verify whether the following risk factor is truly present in the given subsection of a bond prospectus.\n\nRisk Factor Question:\nDoes the text indicate that the industry is subject to a high degree of regulatory scrutiny?\n\nText Under Review:\nTitle: Our level of indebtedness could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\nText: After giving effect to the Transactions, as of June 30, 2019, we would have had debt of approximately $14.9 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding, including (i) $390 million of borrowing under our Credit Agreement, (ii) the notes and other debt secured on a pari passu basis with the notes of $6.07 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding (excluding $100 million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding under our letter of credit facility agreement (as amended, \u201cLC Facility\u201d)), (iii) senior secured second lien notes and other debt secured on a pari passu basis with our senior secured second lien notes of $2.91 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding and (iv) $5.51 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes, but excluding (a) capital leases and mortgage notes and (b) unamortized issue costs, note discounts and premiums, as well as $102 million in standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate, under our senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and our letter of credit facility agreement (as amended, the \u201cLC Facility\u201d). Our Credit Agreement is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of substantially all of our domestic wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals, and our LC Facility is guaranteed and secured by a first priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis with our existing senior secured notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital market, bank credit and other financing activities, depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. The interest expense associated with our indebtedness offsets a substantial portion of our operating income. During 2018, our interest expense was $1.004 billion and represented 61% of our $1.647 billion of operating income. As a result, relatively small percentage changes in our operating income can result in a relatively large percentage change in our net income and earnings per share, both positively and negatively. In addition: - Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. - We may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business, in the healthcare industry or in the economy generally, or if federal or state governments substantially limit or reduce reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. - Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. - Our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions or other needs. - Our significant indebtedness may result in the market value of our stock being more volatile, potentially resulting in larger investment gains or losses for our shareholders, than the market value of the common stock of other companies that have a relatively smaller amount of indebtedness. - A significant portion of our outstanding debt is either subject to early prepayment penalties, such as \u201cmake-whole premiums,\u201d or is not currently callable.

The indentures governing the notes will contain covenants that will not limit the amount of debt we may incur and will impose only limited restrictions on the security we may provide for future debt. We may decide to incur additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our operations and any judgments or settlements or for other business purposes, and our incurrence of any such additional debt may have an adverse effect on our credit rating and the priority of claims of holders of the notes. That additional debt, if incurred, could be held by a number of creditors, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes. The indentures governing the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: - incur liens; - provide subsidiary guarantees; - consummate asset sales; - enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, other than in certain transactions between one or more of our wholly owned subsidiaries and us. 20 ----- These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. In addition, these restrictions will be subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there will be no restrictions on our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional unsecured indebtedness (as described above), make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock or enter into transactions with affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities). We depend on funds from our subsidiaries, which affects our ability to obtain funds to meet our debt service obligations. We hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a result, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries.

Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations, including payment on the notes.

The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale, and the availability of buyers. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes. There may not be sufficient Collateral to pay off all amounts due under the notes, our LC Facility and our existing and future notes that are secured on the same basis as the notes. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral securing the notes may not result in sufficient proceeds to pay some or all amounts due under the notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and our existing and future debt and other obligations that are secured on the same basis as the first lien notes, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our remaining assets.\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: No\nEvidence: \n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

Under applicable federal bankruptcy laws, a secured creditor is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under certain circumstances). Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit a debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though that debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments as long as the secured creditor is afforded “adequate protection” of its interest in the collateral. Although the precise meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, it is intended in general to protect a secured creditor against any diminution in the value of the creditor’s interest in its collateral. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court may find that a secured creditor is “adequately protected” if, for example, the debtor makes certain cash payments or grants the creditor liens on additional or replacement collateral as security for any diminution in the value of the collateral occurring for any reason during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the Collateral trustee could foreclose upon or sell the Collateral or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral following the commencement, and during the pendency, of a bankruptcy case. Furthermore, if a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and our other debt and obligations that are secured on a pari passu basis with the notes, holders of the notes would hold “under-secured claims.” Applicable federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for “under-secured claims” during a debtor’s bankruptcy case. In addition, the Collateral trustee’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on your behalf may be subject to lack of perfection, the consent of third parties, prior liens and practical problems associated with the realization of the Collateral trustee’s security interest in the Collateral.",,as_expected,2019,85,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: The ability of the Collateral trustee to foreclose on the Collateral securing the notes may be limited pursuant to bankruptcy laws.\nText: The notes and subsidiary guarantees will be secured, together with certain of our existing and future secured debt and other obligations, by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of our Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries, as defined and described under \u201cDescription of the Notes\u2014Definitions.\u201d The 22 ----- right of the Collateral trustee for the notes, as a secured party under the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement for the benefit of itself and the holders of the notes, to foreclose upon and sell the Collateral upon the occurrence of a payment default is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy laws, including the automatic stay provision contained in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Outstanding revolving loans accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum or the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, in each case based on available credit. An unused commitment fee payable on the undrawn portion of the revolving loans ranges from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum based on available credit. Our borrowing availability is based on a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable, including self-pay accounts. At June 30, 2019, we had $190 million of cash borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement subject to a weighted average interest rate of 3.77%, and we had $2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. Based on our eligible receivables, $808 million was available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019. We expect to seek an amendment to the Credit Agreement following the offering of the notes, which may include increasing borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date, among other changes.\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: No\nEvidence: \n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

The effect of such designation shall be to include the obligations in respect of the Notes of each series and the Subsidiary Guarantees within the secured obligations covered by the stock pledge agreement dated March 3, 2009 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, including by the first amendment to the pledge agreement dated May 8, 2009, the second amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 15, 2009, the pledge amendment dated May 15, 2013, the pledge amendment dated October 1, 2013, the third amendment to the pledge agreement dated March 7, 2014, the fourth amendment to the pledge agreement dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment dated October 5, 2015, the fifth amendment to the pledge agreement dated December 1, 2016, the sixth amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 14, 2017, the seventh amendment to the pledge agreement dated February 5, 2019 and an eighth amendment to be dated as of the Issue Date, the “pledge agreement”) on a first priority basis to the obligations covered by the pledge agreement on the Issue Date. The pledge agreement defines the terms of the pledges that secure the Notes of each series. These pledges will secure the payment and performance when due of all of our obligations under the Indenture and the Notes of each series as provided in the pledge agreement. We, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the collateral trustee will execute an amendment to the pledge agreement, to be dated the date of the Issue Date (the “pledge amendment”). The collateral trust agreement sets forth the terms on which the Collateral will be received, held, administered, maintained and enforced and the terms on which the proceeds of all Liens upon the Capital Stock pledged as collateral at any time in respect of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt shall be distributed, in trust for the benefit of the present and future holders of the FirstPriority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt. 33 ----- The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the terms of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement, even during an event of default. Under the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to or in respect of the Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of amendments to, and waivers of past defaults under documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens on the Collateral. So long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, we and our Subsidiaries will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by us and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral pledged by us. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default or event of default: (1) all of our rights to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will cease, and all such rights will become vested in the collateral trustee, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights; (2) all of our rights to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other payments will be paid to the collateral trustee; and (3) the collateral trustee may sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement. The collateral trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the collateral trust agreement will distribute all funds distributed under the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and received by the collateral trustee for the benefit of the holders of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt. The collateral trust agreement governs the terms on which the Collateral may be disposed of, including, but not limited to, the terms on which all or any portion of the Collateral may be released from the Liens created by the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and the terms on which the Collateral may be foreclosed upon following a default or event of default. The pledge of the Capital Stock of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary as it relates to the Notes of any series and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be released: (1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes of such series; (2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture; (3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including by way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction, but only with respect to the Capital Stock sold in such transaction or as otherwise contemplated by the definition of Permitted Joint Venture Transaction; (4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture; (5) in respect of pledged Capital Stock owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor has been released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or 34 ----- (6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes of such series as provided below under the caption “—Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.” We will comply with the applicable provisions of TIA §314. To the extent applicable, we will cause TIA § 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA § 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien of the security documents, to be complied with. Any certificate or opinion required by TIA § 314(d) may be made by an officer of Tenet except in cases where TIA § 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert selected by Tenet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) if we determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of TIA § 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including “no action” letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that we file a registration statement with respect to any of the Notes of a series as described under “Registration Rights” and such registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, the Collateral securing the Notes of such series will not include any Capital Stock and any other securities of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other securities results in us being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but only to the extent necessary not to be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes of such series affected; provided that neither we nor any Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of ours due to the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock secures the Notes of such series affected thereby, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes of such series affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required not to be subject to such requirement. In such event, the pledge agreement may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of the Notes of such series, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the collateral trustee on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock to secure the Notes of a series in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement. The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Liens we can create on the Collateral securing the Notes as well as on our other assets as described under the caption “—Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries— _Limitations on Liens.” The Credit Agreement permits us to refinance our existing unsecured Senior Debt through_ the issuance of various forms of debt, including secured debt. Under the Credit Agreement, we may refinance unsecured Senior Debt with secured debt if the secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) after giving pro forma effect to such refinancing would be less than 4.0 to 1.0 for the most recently ended four consecutive fiscal quarters. 35 -----",,as_expected,2019,85,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Trustee and the collateral trustee on March 3, 2009 (the \u201ccollateral trust agreement\u201d).

In such event, the pledge agreement may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of the Notes of such series, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the collateral trustee on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary\u2019s Capital Stock to secure the Notes of a series in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement.

In such event, the pledge agreement may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of the Notes of such series, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the collateral trustee on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary\u2019s Capital Stock to secure the Notes of a series in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement.

The pledge agreement defines the terms of the pledges that secure the Notes of each series. These pledges will secure the payment and performance when due of all of our obligations under the Indenture and the Notes of each series as provided in the pledge agreement. We, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the collateral trustee will execute an amendment to the pledge agreement, to be dated the date of the Issue Date (the \u201cpledge amendment\u201d). The collateral trust agreement sets forth the terms on which the Collateral will be received, held, administered, maintained and enforced and the terms on which the proceeds of all Liens upon the Capital Stock pledged as collateral at any time in respect of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt shall be distributed, in trust for the benefit of the present and future holders of the FirstPriority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt. 33 ----- The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the terms of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement, even during an event of default. Under the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to or in respect of the Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of amendments to, and waivers of past defaults under documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens on the Collateral. So long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, we and our Subsidiaries will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by us and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral pledged by us. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default or event of default: (1) all of our rights to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will cease, and all such rights will become vested in the collateral trustee, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights; (2) all of our rights to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other payments will be paid to the collateral trustee; and (3) the collateral trustee may sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement. The collateral trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the collateral trust agreement will distribute all funds distributed under the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and received by the collateral trustee for the benefit of the holders of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt. The collateral trust agreement governs the terms on which the Collateral may be disposed of, including, but not limited to, the terms on which all or any portion of the Collateral may be released from the Liens created by the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and the terms on which the Collateral may be foreclosed upon following a default or event of default. The pledge of the Capital Stock of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary as it relates to the Notes of any series and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be released: (1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes of such series; (2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture; (3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including by way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction, but only with respect to the Capital Stock sold in such transaction or as otherwise contemplated by the definition of Permitted Joint Venture Transaction; (4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture; (5) in respect of pledged Capital Stock owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor has been released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or 34 ----- (6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes of such series as provided below under the caption \u201c\u2014Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.\u201d We will comply with the applicable provisions of TIA \u00a7314. To the extent applicable, we will cause TIA \u00a7 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA \u00a7 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien of the security documents, to be complied with. Any certificate or opinion required by TIA \u00a7 314(d) may be made by an officer of Tenet except in cases where TIA \u00a7 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert selected by Tenet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA \u00a7 314(d) if we determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of TIA \u00a7 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including \u201cno action\u201d letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA \u00a7 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that we file a registration statement with respect to any of the Notes of a series as described under \u201cRegistration Rights\u201d and such registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, the Collateral securing the Notes of such series will not include any Capital Stock and any other securities of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other securities results in us being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but only to the extent necessary not to be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes of such series affected; provided that neither we nor any Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of ours due to the fact that such Subsidiary\u2019s Capital Stock secures the Notes of such series affected thereby, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes of such series affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required not to be subject to such requirement. In such event, the pledge agreement may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of the Notes of such series, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the collateral trustee on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary\u2019s Capital Stock to secure the Notes of a series in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, and such law, rule or regulation is applicable to us as a result of the Notes of such series, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the Notes of such series but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement. The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Liens we can create on the Collateral securing the Notes as well as on our other assets as described under the caption \u201c\u2014Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries\u2014 _Limitations on Liens.\u201d The Credit Agreement permits us to refinance our existing unsecured Senior Debt through_ the issuance of various forms of debt, including secured debt.

We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of each series pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control provisions of the Indenture, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the change of control provisions of the Indenture, by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment date, we will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes of each series or portions of Notes of such series properly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes of each series or portions of Notes of such series properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes of each series properly accepted together with an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series or portions of Notes of such series being purchased by us. The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes of a series properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes of such series, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder Notes of such series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes of such series surrendered, if any; provided that each such Notes of such series issued for surrendered but unpurchased Notes of such series will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment date. The provisions described above that require us to make a Change of Control Offer following a change of control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable to the change of control event. Except as described above with respect to a change of control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes of a series to require that we repurchase or redeem the Notes of such series in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes of a series properly tendered and not validly withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of us and our Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes of a series to require us to repurchase its Notes of such series as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of us and our Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Indenture relating to our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes of a series as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series. 40 ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or regulations. The agreements governing our other debt contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control, and future agreements may contain prohibitions on repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the Notes of each series. The exercise by the holders of Notes of a series of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes of such series upon a Change of Control could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes of a series, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders to the purchase of such Notes of such series or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes of any series. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes of a series would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other debt.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, we and such Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions subject to the preceding paragraph which is not applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph exceeds $100.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash may be used in any other manner not prohibited by the Indenture. For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: (1) the assumption or discharge of Debt or other liabilities of ours or any Subsidiary and the release of us or such Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities or other obligations received by us or any Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by us or such Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Disposition, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; (3) Additional Assets; and (4) Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by us or any of our Subsidiaries in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this proviso that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value. In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of any Notes of any series (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), we will purchase the Notes of such series tendered pursuant to an offer by us for the Notes of such series (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, such other price, not to exceed 100%, as may be provided for by the terms of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If there remains a balance of Net Available Cash after purchasing all securities tendered, then such balance may be used in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, we will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes of a series will be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or any greater integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Notes of each series (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $100.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer. We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of any Notes of any series pursuant to 42 ----- this covenant.

The exercise by the holders of Notes of a series of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes of such series upon an Asset Disposition could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Disposition itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes of a series, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders to the purchase of such Notes of such series or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes of such series. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes of such series would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other debt.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) that have been made by us or any of our Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (and the change in any associated Secured Debt obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period.

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,106,REGISTRATION RIGHTS,106.1,"BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM The global notes",106.1.1,,"The notes of each series will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form, without interest coupons (the “global notes”), as follows: - notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (each a “QIB”) under Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global note; - notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by the Regulation S global note; and - any notes sold in the secondary market to institutional accredited investors will be represented by the Institutional Accredited Investor global note. Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (“DTC participants”) or persons who hold interests through DTC participants. We expect that under procedures established by DTC: - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers; and - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global note). Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on behalf of the owners of such interests. Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S global note through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.”",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note. Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance Period, and to which global note the transfer is being made, the trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the applicable indenture. In addition, in the case of a transfer of interests to 59 ----- the Institutional Accredited Investor global note, the trustee may require the buyer to deliver a representation letter in the form provided in the applicable indenture that states, among other things, that the buyer is not acquiring notes with a view to distributing them in violation of the Securities Act. A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another global note will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in the other global note. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the applicable notes will be issued, upon our satisfaction that the notes are no longer required to bear a restricted Securities Act legend in order to maintain compliance with the Securities Act, we may, at our option, take the necessary action such that holders of notes bearing a restricted Securities Act legend may automatically exchange such notes for notes that do not bear a restricted Securities Act legend at any time on or after the 366th calendar day after the Issue Date of the notes.",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,
377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,106,REGISTRATION RIGHTS,106.3,Book-entry procedures for the global notes,106.3.1,,"All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Company, the trustee, or the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indentures for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the trustee under the indentures. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the indentures (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). 60 ----- Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the notes represented by a global note will be made by the trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be affected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be affected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be affected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

377_2,Preliminary Offerings 2019.md,106,REGISTRATION RIGHTS,106.5,,106.5.1,,"On the Issue Date of the notes, we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a registration rights agreement for each series of notes with the initial purchasers, pursuant to which we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will agree, for the respective benefit of the holders of such notes, that if any such notes are not freely tradable (as defined below) as of the 380th day after the Issue Date, which date we refer to as the “free trade date,” we, and the Subsidiary Guarantors will, at our own expense, use all commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement, which we refer to as an “exchange offer registration statement,” with respect to a registered exchange offer, which we refer to as the “exchange offer,” to exchange such notes for replacement notes with terms identical in all material respects to such notes (we refer to the notes to be issued in the exchange offer as the “exchange notes”), to cause such exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act and to consummate such exchange offer, provided that our obligation to file an exchange offer registration statement with respect to any notes will cease as soon as such notes become freely tradable. “Freely tradable” means, with respect to any notes, notes (a) that are eligible to be sold by a person who has not been our affiliate during the preceding three months without any volume or manner of sale restrictions under the Securities Act, (b) for which we have provided a certificate to the trustee instructing the trustee that the restricted legend thereon no longer applies, and (c) that have been assigned an unrestricted CUSIP number. In accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, notes held by holders who are not “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us will be freely tradable without any volume or manner of sale restrictions if, among other things, such notes have been held by such holder for at least six months and we have filed all reports required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months prior to the free trade date. If we are required to effect an exchange offer, once such exchange offer registration statement has been declared effective, we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will offer the applicable exchange notes in exchange for surrender of the applicable notes. We and the Subsidiary Guarantors will keep such exchange offer open for at least 20 business days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date that notice of such exchange offer is mailed to holders of the applicable notes. For each note surrendered to us pursuant to such exchange offer, the holder who surrendered such note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest on each exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the note surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on such new note, from the original issue date of such note. Under existing interpretations of the Securities Act by the SEC contained in several “no-action” letters to third parties, and subject to the immediately following sentence, we believe that the exchange notes would generally be freely transferable by holders thereof after the applicable exchange offer without further registration under the Securities Act (subject to certain representations required to be made by each holder of notes, as set forth below). However, any holder of notes who is an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us or any Subsidiary Guarantor and any holder of notes who intends to participate in such exchange offer for the purpose of distributing exchange notes (1) will not be able to rely on the interpretation of the staff of the SEC, (2) will not be able to tender its notes in the exchange offer and (3) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any sale or transfer of the notes unless such sale or transfer is made pursuant to an exemption from such requirements. In addition, in connection with any resales of exchange notes, any broker dealer, which we refer to as an “exchanging broker dealer,” that acquires exchange notes in such exchange offer in exchange for notes acquired for its own account as a result of market making or other trading activities must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act. The SEC has taken the position that exchanging broker dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to those exchange notes with the prospectus contained in the 57 ----- exchange offer registration statement. We will agree to make available for a period of up to 180 days after consummation of such exchange offer a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act to any exchanging broker dealer and any other persons with similar prospectus delivery requirements, for use in connection with any resale of the applicable exchange notes. An exchanging broker dealer or any other person that delivers such a prospectus to purchasers in connection with such resales will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement (including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder). Each holder of notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange notes for exchange notes in the applicable exchange offer will be required to make certain representations, including representations that (1) any exchange notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (2) it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the exchange notes, (3) it is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us, and (4) it is not acting on behalf of any person who could not truthfully make the foregoing representations. Although we intend to cause the notes of each series to become freely tradable on or prior to the free trade date or consummate such exchange offer on the terms and timetable described above, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. In the event that the notes of any series do not become freely tradable on or prior to the free trade date, the interest rate borne by the notes of such series will be increased by one quarter of one percent per annum for the first 90-day period and thereafter it will be increased by an additional one quarter of one percent per annum for each 90-day period that elapses; provided that the aggregate increase in such annual interest rate may in no event exceed one percent. Such additional interest will not accrue for our failure to provide a certificate to the trustee instructing it that the restricted legend on the notes no longer applies unless we have received a request to do so by a holder of the applicable notes or the trustee on or after the 380th day after the Issue Date; provided that if we receive such a request on or after the fifth business day immediately preceding the free trade date and the restricted legend on the applicable notes has not been removed by the close of business on the fifth business day thereafter, additional interest will accrue on such notes until (1) such notes become freely tradable or (2) such exchange offer registration statement has been declared effective and the exchange offer has been consummated for such notes. Once all outstanding notes of a series have become freely tradable or all notes of such series tendered into such exchange offer have been exchanged for exchange notes that are freely tradable (other than exchange notes held by exchanging broker dealers), special interest will cease to accrue. This summary of certain provisions of the registration rights agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the complete provisions of the registration rights agreements, copies of which we will make available to holders of notes upon request. 58 -----",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes and exchange notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes or exchange notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the issuer, the initial purchasers, or the guarantors are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes and exchange notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (and the exchange of notes for exchange notes) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws. 70 -----",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes or exchange notes (and holding the notes or exchange notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. 71 -----",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a holder may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes in excess of stated interest, based upon a comparable yield, regardless of the holder’s method of tax accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the notes.

The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders,108.2.1,,"_Stated Interest_ Stated interest on a note will generally be includable by a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is received in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_ Upon the disposition of a note by sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, a U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously included in income) and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the note. A U.S. holder’s gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such note for longer than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. _Medicare Tax_ A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special category of trusts that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. holder’s “net investment income” (or, in the case of an estate or trust, “undistributed net investment income”) for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder’s “modified adjusted gross income” (or, in the case of 73 ----- an estate or trust, “adjusted gross income”) for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000 depending on the individual’s circumstances). Net investment income will generally include interest income and net gains from the disposition of the notes, unless such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust should consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in the notes. _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ In general, a U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding at the applicable tax rate with respect to payments of stated interest or the gross proceeds from dispositions (including a redemption or retirement) of notes, unless the holder (i) is an entity that is exempt from backup withholding and, when required, provides appropriate documentation to that effect or (ii) timely provides the applicable withholding agent with the social security number or other taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), certifies that the TIN provided is correct and that the holder has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding due to underreporting of interest or dividends, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. In addition, such payments to U.S. holders that are not otherwise exempt from these rules will generally be subject to information reporting requirements. A U.S. holder who does not provide the applicable withholding agent with the correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

If these conditions are not met, interest on the notes paid to a non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate unless (a) an applicable income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such 74 ----- tax, and the non-U.S. holder claims the benefit of that treaty by providing an appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed, or (b) the interest is ECI and the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification requirements by providing an appropriate IRS Form W-8ECI (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed. If the interest on the notes is ECI, the non-U.S. holder generally will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (and the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax described above will not apply, provided the appropriate statement is provided to us or our paying agent) in the same manner as a U.S. holder. If, however, a non-U.S. holder is eligible for the benefits of any income tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, any interest income that is ECI will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (and withholding tax if applicable) in the manner specified by the treaty, provided that an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) has been properly completed and provided by the non-U.S. holder. In addition, a corporate non-U.S. holder may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate, or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate, on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. _Disposition of Notes_ Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, a non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain (other than any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which would be treated as interest and subject to the rules discussed above in “—Interest”) recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes unless: - the gain is ECI (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment); or - in the case of a non-U.S. holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year and certain other requirements are met. If a non-U.S. holder falls under the first of these exceptions, the holder will be taxed on the net gain derived from the disposition under the graduated U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to U.S. Persons generally, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to the branch profits tax described above under “—Interest”, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If an individual non-U.S. holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30%, unless reduced by treaty, on the amount by which the gain derived from the disposition from sources within the United States exceeds certain capital losses allocable to sources within the United States for the taxable year of the sale. _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to non-U.S. holders the amount of interest paid to non-U.S. holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding (if any) may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a non-U.S. holder resides or is organized under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest that we or our paying agent make, provided that the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption. The payment of the proceeds of the disposition of notes (including a retirement or redemption) to or through the United States office of a United States or foreign broker will be subject to information reporting and backup 75 ----- withholding unless the non-U.S. holder provides the certification described above or otherwise establishes an exemption. The proceeds of a disposition effected outside the United States by a holder of the notes to or through a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. However, if that broker is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Person, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for certain periods is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, or a foreign partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or that has one or more partners that are U.S. Persons who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the partnership, information reporting requirements will apply unless such holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided it timely furnishes the required information to the IRS. The applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the IRS the amount of any “reportable payments” and any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.",,as_expected,2019,85,,,,

While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the notes (including retirement or redemption) on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely.

As a result, the tax considerations of purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes could differ from those described below. This summary deals only with purchasers who purchase the notes for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the applicable series of notes are sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

We will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the matters discussed herein and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein.
