remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, repayment and refinancing of other debt,

subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) will guarantee the notes on a first-lien senior secured
basis. The notes and the related guarantees will be Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ senior secured first-lien
obligations and will rank senior to all of Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated to the notes or the related guarantees and, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined
under “Description of the Notes—Security”) securing the notes, be effectively senior to Tenet’s and the Subsidiary
Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness secured on a more junior basis and unsecured indebtedness and other
unsecured liabilities. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time prior to       , 2024, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, plus a make-whole

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in
connection with the offering of the notes. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering
memorandum is personal to the offeree to whom it has been delivered by the initial purchasers and does
not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally. Distribution of this offering
memorandum to any person other than the offeree and any person retained to advise such offeree is
unauthorized and any disclosure of the contents of this offering memorandum without our prior written
consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and

purchase any notes or this offering is terminated for any reason, you must return this offering
memorandum and all documents referred to herein to: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, 200 West Street, New
York, NY 10282.

Upon receiving this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request from us, and to review, all additional information considered by you to be
necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained or incorporated by
reference herein, (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial
purchasers in connection with any investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment
decision, and (3) we have not authorized any person to deliver any information different from that
contained in this offering memorandum. The offering is being made on the basis of this offering
memorandum. Any decision to purchase the notes in the offering must be based on the information
contained in this document. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own
examination of Tenet and the terms of this offering, including the merits and risks involved.

The information contained in this offering memorandum has been furnished by us and other sources
we believe to be reliable. The initial purchasers make no representations or warranties, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information set forth or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum, and you should not rely on anything contained or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum as a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the

material of certain documents, but reference is made to the actual documents. All such summaries are
qualified in their entirety by this reference. See “Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We obtained the market and competitive position data used throughout and incorporated in this
offering memorandum from our own research, surveys or studies conducted by third parties and industry
or general publications. Industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained
information from sources believed to be reliable, but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of
such information. While we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable, neither we nor
the initial purchasers have independently verified such data and neither we nor the initial purchasers
make any representation as to the accuracy of such information. Similarly, we believe our internal
research is reliable, but it has not been verified by any independent sources.

**REVIEW BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION**

In connection with the issuance of the notes, we will enter into a registration rights agreement
obligating us, under certain circumstances, to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an
exchange offer for the notes or a shelf registration statement with respect to a resale of such notes. See
“Registration Rights.”

In the course of the review by the SEC of any such registration statement, we may be required to
make changes to the description of our businesses, our financial statements and other information. We
may also be required to present certain additional disclosures and financial data not included in this
offering memorandum. While we believe that our financial statements and other information included, or
incorporated by reference, in this offering memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies,
in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles and the regulations published by
the SEC (with the exception of information that would be required by Rules 13-01 and 13-02 of
Regulation S-X if the notes were registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)), comments by the SEC on the registration statement may require modification or
reformulation of our financial statements and other information we present, or incorporate by reference, in
this offering memorandum and any required modification or reformulation could be significant.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum
constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and
Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, that
address activities, events, outcomes, business strategies and other matters that we plan, expect, intend,
assume, believe, budget, predict, forecast, project, target, estimate or anticipate (and other similar
expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including (but not
limited to) disclosure regarding (i) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) our future earnings, financial
position, and operational and strategic initiatives, and (iii) developments in the healthcare industry.
Forward-looking statements represent management’s expectations, based on currently available
information, as to the outcome and timing of future events, but, by their nature, address matters that are
indeterminate. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which we
are unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Such factors include,
but are not limited to, the following:


-----

  - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations, financial condition and liquidity,
particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant period of time;

  - the impact on our business of any future modifications to or court decisions affecting the viability
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the enactment of, or changes in, other statutes and regulations
affecting the healthcare industry generally, as well as reductions to Medicare and Medicaid
payment rates or changes in reimbursement practices or to Medicaid supplemental payment
programs;

  - adverse regulatory developments, government investigations or litigation, as well as the timing
and impact of additional changes in federal tax laws, regulations and policies, and the outcome of
pending and any future tax audits, disputes and litigation associated with our tax positions;

  - our ability to enter into or renew managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms;
changes in service mix, revenue mix and surgical volumes, including potential declines in the
population covered under managed care agreements; and the impact of the industry trend toward
value-based purchasing and alternative payment models;

  - the impact of competition on all aspects of our business; and our success in recruiting and
retaining physicians and other healthcare professionals;

  - our ability to achieve operating and financial targets, attain expected levels of patient volumes,
and identify and execute on measures designed to save or control costs or streamline operations,
including our ability to realize savings under our cost-reduction initiatives;

  - potential security threats, catastrophic events and other disruptions affecting our information
technology and related systems;

  - operational and other risks associated with acquisitions and joint venture arrangements;

  - the outcome of the process we have undertaken to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our subsidiary,
Conifer Holdings, Inc. (“Conifer”), which operates our Conifer Health Solutions business, as a
separate, independent, publicly traded company, as well as potential disruptions to our business
or diverted management attention as a result of the Conifer spin-off process;

  - the impact of our significant indebtedness; the availability and terms of capital to refinance
existing debt, fund our operations and expand our business; and our ability to comply with our
debt covenants and, over time, reduce leverage;

  - the effect that general adverse economic conditions, consumer behavior and other factors have
on our volumes and our ability to collect outstanding receivables on a timely basis, among other
things; and increases in the amount of uninsured accounts and deductibles and copays for
insured accounts; and

  - other factors and risks referenced in this offering memorandum and our public filings.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering
memorandum, “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Form 10-K”), and “Forward-Looking Statements” under Item 1 of Part I
of our 2020 Form 10-K and Item 2 of Part I of each of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 (“2021 Form 10-Qs”), as such
discussions may be further updated by subsequent filings we make with the SEC.

When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other
cautionary statements included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Should one or
more of the risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum
occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. We specifically disclaim any obligation
to update any information contained in a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its


-----

entirety, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary information.

**Our Company**

Tenet Healthcare Corporation is a diversified healthcare services company headquartered in Dallas,
Texas. Through our subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, including USPI Holding Company, Inc.
(“USPI”), at September 30, 2021, we operated an expansive care network that included 60 hospitals and
approximately 460 other healthcare facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers,
surgical hospitals, and other care sites and clinics. In addition through our Conifer subsidiary, we operate
Conifer Health Solutions, LLC, which provides revenue cycle management and value-based care services
to hospitals, health systems, physician practices, employers and other clients. Following exploration of
strategic alternatives for Conifer, in July 2019, we announced our intention to pursue a tax‑free spin-off of
Conifer as a separate, independent, publicly traded company.

Our executive offices are located at 14201 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75254. Our telephone
number is (469) 893-2200. Our website is www.tenethealth.com. The information found on our website

**Recent Developments**

**The SCD Acquisition**

On November 8, 2021, our subsidiary, United Surgical Partners International, Inc., entered into a
definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the principals of Surgical Center Development #3,
LLC and Surgical Center Development #4, LLC (collectively, “SCD”), pursuant to which we will acquire all
of SCD’s ownership interests in a portfolio of 92 ambulatory surgical centers (each, an “ASC”) and certain
other related assets (the “Acquisition”) for approximately $1.2 billion, subject to customary purchase price
adjustments. If the Acquisition is completed, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the
notes, after payment of fees and expenses, to finance the consideration for the Acquisition, with any
remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, repayment and
refinancing of other debt, cash on balance sheet, working capital and capital expenditures. If the
Acquisition is not completed, we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which
may include, without limitation, repayment and refinancing of other debt, cash on balance sheet, working
capital and capital expenditures. In addition, we announced our intention to pursue the acquisition of a
portion of the ownership interests of physician partners in various of these ASCs for incremental
consideration of up to $250 million in aggregate in order to acquire a majority interest in many of the
ASCs.

The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, covenants and termination
provisions for each of the parties, as well as certain indemnities. The completion of the transaction
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among
others, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.

days of the closing of any such Qualified Equity Offering.

Certain Covenants ................................. The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that,

                    - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets,
other than in certain transactions between one or more of our

These restrictions are subject to a number of important
exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there will be no
restrictions on our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay
dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock,
purchase or redeem capital stock or enter into transactions with
affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities
(including unaffiliated entities). See “Risk Factors—The


-----

_protections provided in the notes are limited, and we may take_
_actions that could adversely affect the notes.”_

Trustee ................................................... The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.

Transfer Restrictions .............................. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or

the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. As a result, the notes
may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. See
“Notice to Investors” beginning on page 49 of this offering
memorandum.

after payment of fees and expenses, to finance the consideration
for the acquisition of SCD’s ownership interest in a portfolio of 92
ASCs and certain other related assets, with any remainder for
general corporate purposes, which may include, without
limitation, repayment and refinancing of other debt, cash on
balance sheet, working capital and capital expenditures. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—The SCD Acquisition” and
“Use of Proceeds.” If the Acquisition is not completed, we intend
to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which
may include, without limitation, repayment and refinancing of
other debt, cash on balance sheet, working capital and capital
expenditures.

Risk Factors ........................................... Before deciding whether to purchase the notes, you should

carefully consider the matters set forth under the caption “Risk
_Factors” and the other information included or incorporated by_
reference in this offering memorandum.


-----

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves risk. Before deciding whether to purchase the notes, you should_
_carefully consider the risk factors described in our 2020 Form 10-K, which risk factors are incorporated by_
_reference herein, as well as the following risk factors and the other information contained or incorporated_
_by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Certain of these risks could have a material adverse effect on_
_our business, financial condition and results of operations and could materially adversely affect your_
_investment in the notes. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently_
_deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results_
_of operations._

**_The protections provided in the notes are limited, and we may take actions that could adversely_**
**_affect the notes._**

Our currently outstanding senior unsecured notes and senior secured notes are not rated investment
grade by either S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s Investors Services, and the same will be true for the
notes in this offering. The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that will not limit the
amount of debt we may incur and will impose only limited restrictions on the security we may provide for
future debt. We may decide to incur additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our
operations and any judgments or settlements or for other business purposes, and our incurrence of any
such additional debt may have an adverse effect on our credit rating and the priority of claims of holders
of the notes. That additional debt, if incurred, could be held by a number of creditors, including affiliates
of the initial purchasers of the notes.

The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will restrict our
ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

  - incur liens;

  - provide subsidiary guarantees;

  - consummate asset sales;

  - enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or

  - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, other than in certain transactions
between one or more of our wholly owned subsidiaries and us.

These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital
expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct
operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.

In addition, these restrictions will be subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.
In particular, there will be no restrictions on our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional
unsecured indebtedness (as described above), make restricted payments, pay dividends or make
distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock or enter into transactions with
affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).

**_We depend on funds from our subsidiaries, which affects our ability to obtain funds to meet our_**
**_debt service obligations._**

We hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct and indirect
subsidiaries. As a result, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries.
Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries
to meet our debt service and other obligations, including payment on the notes. The ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating
results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt
of such subsidiaries.


-----

Our less than wholly owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to
distribute cash to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access
their cash flows to service their respective debt obligations, including in respect of the notes.

**_We may be unable to purchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of a “change of control” (as specified in “Description of the Notes—Repurchase
_at the Option of Holders”) you may require us to purchase all or any part of your notes at 101% of the_
aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our Credit
Agreement may restrict our ability to repurchase the notes under these circumstances and any of our
future debt agreements may also limit our ability to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a
change of control event. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase your
notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under the indebtedness with such restrictions.
We cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to purchase your notes, particularly as
that change of control event may trigger a similar repurchase requirement for, or result in the acceleration
of, other indebtedness.

**_There is no public market for the notes, and you cannot be sure that an active trading market will_**
**_develop for the notes._**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market, and we do not intend to
list them on any securities exchange. Certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend
to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the initial purchasers are not
obligated to do so, and any initial purchaser may cease its market-making activities at any time. As a
result, you cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for the notes, or for any of the
exchange notes (as defined and described under “Registration Rights”) exchanged for any notes
pursuant to any exchange offer.

The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our
results of operations and financial condition, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities
dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors. An active or liquid trading market for the notes
may not develop.

**_Resale of the notes is restricted, which could limit the liquidity or affect the price of the notes._**

We have not registered the notes or the subsidiary guarantees for the notes under the Securities Act
or any state securities laws. Neither the notes nor the subsidiary guarantees may be offered or sold in
the United States, unless they are registered (including pursuant to the registration rights agreement) or
the offer or sale is made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of notes comply
with applicable securities laws. These restrictions could limit the liquidity or affect the price of the notes.
See “Registration Rights” and “Notice to Investors” below.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the notes._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair
market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral
would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the
Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale, and the availability of buyers. By its
nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In
the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in
a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral may not be
sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes.

There may not be sufficient Collateral to pay off all amounts due under the notes, our LC Facility and
our existing and future notes that are secured on the same basis as the notes.

Consequently, liquidating the Collateral securing the notes may not result in sufficient proceeds to
pay some or all amounts due under the notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient


-----

to repay all amounts due on the notes and our existing and future debt and other obligations that are
secured on the same basis as the first lien notes, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from
the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim
against our remaining assets.

**_The ability of the Collateral trustee to foreclose on the Collateral securing the notes may be_**
**_limited pursuant to bankruptcy laws._**

The notes and subsidiary guarantees will be secured, together with certain of our existing and future
secured debt and other obligations, by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership
interests of our Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries, as defined and described under “Description of the
_Notes—Definitions.” The right of the Collateral trustee for the notes, as a secured party under the pledge_
agreement and the collateral trust agreement for the benefit of itself and the holders of the notes, to
foreclose upon and sell the Collateral upon the occurrence of a payment default is likely to be significantly
impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy laws, including the automatic stay provision
contained in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Under applicable federal bankruptcy laws, a secured creditor is prohibited from foreclosing upon or
repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed
from such a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under certain
circumstances). Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit a debtor to continue to
retain and use collateral even though that debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments as
long as the secured creditor is afforded “adequate protection” of its interest in the collateral. Although the
precise meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, it is intended in
general to protect a secured creditor against any diminution in the value of the creditor’s interest in its
collateral.

Accordingly, the bankruptcy court may find that a secured creditor is “adequately protected” if, for
example, the debtor makes certain cash payments or grants the creditor liens on additional or
replacement collateral as security for any diminution in the value of the collateral occurring for any reason
during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
powers of a bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the Collateral trustee could foreclose
upon or sell the Collateral or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for
any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral following the commencement, and during the
pendency, of a bankruptcy case. Furthermore, if a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the
Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and our other debt and obligations that
are secured on a pari passu basis with the notes, holders of the notes would hold “under-secured claims.”
Applicable federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’
fees for “under-secured claims” during a debtor’s bankruptcy case. In addition, the Collateral trustee’s
ability to foreclose on the Collateral on your behalf may be subject to lack of perfection, the consent of
third parties, prior liens and practical problems associated with the realization of the Collateral trustee’s
security interest in the Collateral.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void subsidiary_**
**_guarantees. Pursuant to such statutes, courts could require holders of the notes to return_**
**_payments received from the Subsidiary Guarantors._**

Under federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, if, among
other things, any Subsidiary Guarantor, at the time it incurred the debt evidenced by its subsidiary
guarantee:

  - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the subsidiary guarantee;

  - issued the subsidiary guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its present or
future creditors; and, in either case;

  - was insolvent or rendered insolvent as a result of issuing the subsidiary guarantees;


-----

  - was engaged in a business or transaction for which that Subsidiary Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

  - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as
they matured,

then the subsidiary guarantee of that Subsidiary Guarantor could be voided, or claims by holders of the
notes under that subsidiary guarantee could be subordinated to all other debts of that Subsidiary
Guarantor. In addition, any payment by that Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its subsidiary guarantee
could be required to be returned to that Subsidiary Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors
of that Subsidiary Guarantor.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon
the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a Subsidiary
Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of all of
its assets at a fair valuation;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

**_The Collateral securing the notes may be diluted under certain circumstances, which could affect_**
**_the value of the notes or your ability to recover amounts due._**

The lien on the Collateral securing the notes will rank pari passu with the liens securing $770 million
aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $600 million
aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $700 million
aggregate principal amount of our 7.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025, $2.1 billion
aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2026, $1.5 billion
aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2027, $600 million
aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2028, $1.4 billion
aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2029 and obligations
outstanding under our LC Facility. The Collateral that will secure this indebtedness may secure additional
senior indebtedness or other obligations that we or certain of our subsidiaries incur in the future, subject
to restrictions on our or their ability to incur debt and liens under our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility
and our indentures. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness or
other obligations secured by the Collateral.

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and_**
**_joint ventures and, accordingly, your ability to realize on the assets of those entities may be_**
**_limited._**

The notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will have priority
as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any
non-guarantor subsidiaries, these subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred
equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us.

The notes will not be guaranteed by or secured by a pledge of the capital stock or other ownership
interests of any of our current or future (i) non-U.S. subsidiaries, (ii) U.S. subsidiaries that do not own or
operate a hospital and that do not have a direct or indirect equity ownership interest in a subsidiary that
owns or operates a hospital, or (iii) non-wholly owned subsidiaries whose organizational documents or
related joint venture or similar agreements would (A) prohibit such guarantee or pledge without the
consent of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned subsidiaries), or (B) upon the
making of such guarantee or pledge, trigger in favor of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our
wholly owned subsidiaries) rights in respect of the capital stock or other ownership interests of such


-----

subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available
therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the Subsidiary
Guarantors have to receive any assets of any of these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or
reorganization, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any
of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’ creditors,
including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries.

The Company may from time to time evaluate certain joint venture opportunities with respect to
certain of its hospitals. To the extent the Company enters into such a joint venture opportunity, it may
agree to release certain Collateral consisting of stock in such hospital in connection with that transaction
and in certain circumstances the guarantee by such entity of the notes could also be released. See
“Description of the Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes will be effectively subordinated to the right of_**
**_creditors who have a security interest in our assets that are not part of the Collateral securing the_**
**_notes, to the extent of the value of those assets._**

The notes and the guarantees will be secured only by the capital stock and other ownership interests
of our Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries and will not be secured by any other assets, including any assets of
the Domestic Hospital Subsidiaries. Subject to the restrictions in our debt agreements, we, including our
subsidiaries, may incur additional indebtedness secured by assets that are not part of the Collateral that
will secure the notes. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under any of our existing
or future indebtedness secured by assets that are not part of the Collateral that will secure the notes, the
holders of such indebtedness could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the holders of
such indebtedness could foreclose on such assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an
event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes at such time. In any such event, because
the notes will not be secured by such assets, remaining proceeds, if any, from the sale of such assets will
be available to pay obligations on the notes only after such indebtedness has been paid in full.

**_The lien sharing provisions of the collateral trust agreement will limit the rights of holders of the_**
**_notes with respect to the Collateral, even during an event of default._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the
terms of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement covering the Collateral, even
during an event of default. Under the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with
respect to or in respect of the Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement
proceedings against the Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of
amendments to, and waivers of past defaults under documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the
direction of the holders of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the
first-priority liens on the Collateral, including $770 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625%
Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.500% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2025, $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2026, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2027, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2028, $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2029 and obligations outstanding under our LC Facility, therefore the
holders of notes will not control such matters.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect to receive approximately $1,450,000,000 of gross proceeds from the sale of the notes
offered hereby. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after payment of fees and
expenses, to finance the acquisition of SCD’s ownership interest in a portfolio of 92 ASCs and certain
other related assets, with any remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include, without
limitation, repayment and refinancing of other debt, cash on balance sheet, working capital and capital
expenditures. See “Summary—Recent Developments—The SCD Acquisition.” If the Acquisition is not
completed, we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, without
limitation, repayment and refinancing of other debt, cash on balance sheet, working capital and capital
expenditures.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization on an actual basis at
September 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis to give effect, as of such date, to the issuance of the notes
net of related estimated fees and expenses in connection therewith, and to the transactions described in
the footnote below. See “Use of Proceeds.” Other than the adjustments discussed herein, no

(1) We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after payment of fees and expenses, to
finance the acquisition of SCD’s ownership interest in a portfolio of 92 ASCs and certain other related
assets for $1.2 billion. The use of the net proceeds does not include any potential acquisition of the
ownership interests of physician partners in various of these ASCs for incremental consideration of up
to $250 million in aggregate in order to acquire a majority interest in certain of the ASCs.

(2) At September 30, 2021, we had no cash borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and we
had less than $1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. Based on our eligible receivables,
$1.802 billion was available for borrowing under our Credit Agreement at September 30, 2021.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Agreement**

We have a senior secured revolving credit facility that provides, subject to borrowing availability, for
revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.9 billion with a $200 million subfacility for
standby letters of credit. The terms governing the credit facility are set forth in that certain Credit
Agreement, dated as of October 19, 2010, among us, the lenders and issuers party thereto, and Citicorp
USA, Inc., as administrative agent for the lenders and the issuers (as amended, restated, amended and
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified to date, the “Credit Agreement”). We amended our Credit
Agreement in April 2020 to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate revolving credit commitments
from the previous limit of $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion (the “Increased Commitments”), subject to borrowing
availability, and (ii) increase the advance rate and raise limits on certain eligible accounts receivable in
the calculation of the borrowing base, in each case, for an incremental period of 364 days. In April 2021,
we further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the availability of the Increased
Commitments through April 22, 2022 and reduce the interest rate margins. Obligations under our Credit
Agreement, which has a scheduled maturity date of September 12, 2024, are guaranteed by substantially
all of our domestic wholly owned hospital subsidiaries and are secured by a first-priority lien on the
eligible inventory and accounts receivable owned by us and the subsidiary guarantors, including
receivables for Medicaid supplemental payments. Outstanding revolving loans accrue interest at either
(i) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum, or (ii) the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, in each case based on
available credit. An unused commitment fee payable on the undrawn portion of the revolving loans
ranges from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum based on available credit. Our borrowing availability is based
on a specified percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable, including self-pay accounts. At
September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our Credit Agreement.
At September 30, 2021, we had no cash borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and we
had less than $1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. Based on our eligible receivables,
$1.802 billion was available for borrowing under our Credit Agreement at September 30, 2021.

**Letter of Credit Facility**

On March 19, 2020, pursuant to an Amendment No. 4, we amended our letter of credit facility,
governed by a Letter of Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2014, among us and the LC
participants and issuers party thereto, and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, sole lead
arranger and sole bookrunner (as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the
“LC Facility”), to increase the aggregate principal amount of standby and documentary letters of credit
that, from time to time, may be issued thereunder from $180 million to $200 million and to extend the
maturity date from March 7, 2021 to September 12, 2024. On July 29, 2020, we further amended the LC
Facility such that the maximum secured debt covenant increased incrementally on a quarterly basis from
4.25 to 1.00 up to 6.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, at which point the maximum ratio
began to step down incrementally on a quarterly basis through the quarter ending December 31, 2021.
At September 30, 2021, the effective maximum secured debt covenant was 5.00 to 1.00. Obligations
under our LC Facility are guaranteed and secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other
ownership interests of certain of our wholly owned domestic hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking
basis with our senior secured first lien notes.

Drawings under any letter of credit issued under our LC Facility that we have not reimbursed within
three business days after notice thereof accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% per
annum. An unused commitment fee is payable at an initial rate of 0.25% per annum with a step up to
0.375% per annum should our secured debt-to-EBITDA ratio equal or exceed 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of
any fiscal quarter. A fee on the aggregate outstanding amount of issued but undrawn letters of credit
accrues at a rate of 1.50% per annum. An issuance fee equal to 0.125% per annum of the aggregate
face amount of each outstanding letter of credit is payable to the account of the issuer of the related letter
of credit. At September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our
LC Facility. At September 30, 2021, we had $139 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under
our LC Facility.


-----

**Senior Secured Notes**

After giving effect to the offering of the notes and the use of proceeds herein, as of September 30,
2021, we would have had $9.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes
outstanding. The $770 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes
will mature on July 15, 2024. Interest on the $770 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625%
Senior Secured First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each
year. The $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes will
mature on September 1, 2024. Interest on the $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625%
Senior Secured First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each
year. The $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes will
mature on April 1, 2025. Interest on the $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.500% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The
$2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Secured First Lien Notes will mature on
January 1, 2026. Interest on the $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Secured
First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The

November 1, 2027. Interest on the $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Secured
First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The
$600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes will mature on
June 15, 2028. Interest on the $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior Secured
First Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The
$1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior Secured First Lien Notes will mature on
June 1, 2029. Interest on the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior Secured First
Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year.

As of September 30, 2021, we had $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured second
lien notes outstanding. Our $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Secured Second
Lien Notes will mature on February 1, 2027. Interest on our 6.250% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes
is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year to holders of record on the
immediately preceding January 15 and July 15.

All of our existing senior secured first-lien notes are guaranteed by our wholly owned domestic
hospital subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock
and other ownership interests of those subsidiaries (the “Collateral”). All of our existing senior secured
second-lien notes are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by our wholly owned domestic hospital
subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and secured by a second-priority pledge of the Collateral. All of our
senior secured first-lien notes and the related subsidiary guarantees are the senior secured obligations of
us and those subsidiaries that have provided subsidiary guarantees thereof. Our senior secured first-lien
notes rank senior to any subordinated indebtedness that we or such guaranteeing subsidiaries may incur;
they are effectively senior to our and such guaranteeing subsidiaries’ existing and future junior secured
and unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities to the extent of the value of the Collateral securing the
senior secured first-lien notes and the subsidiary guarantees; they are effectively subordinated to our
obligations under our Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of the collateral securing borrowings
thereunder; and they are structurally subordinated to all obligations of our non-guaranteeing subsidiaries
to the extent of the assets of such subsidiaries. All of our senior secured second-lien notes and the
related subsidiary guarantees are the senior second-lien secured obligations of us and senior
subordinated second-lien secured obligations of those subsidiaries that have provided subsidiary
guarantees thereof. Our senior secured second-lien notes rank senior to any subordinated indebtedness
that we may incur and equal to any subordinated indebtedness that such guaranteeing subsidiaries may
incur; they are effectively senior to our and such guaranteeing subsidiaries’ existing and future unsecured
indebtedness and indebtedness and other liabilities secured on a more junior basis to the extent of the
value of the Collateral securing the senior secured second-lien notes the subsidiary guarantees; and they
are effectively subordinated to our obligations under our Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of
the collateral securing borrowings thereunder; and they are structurally subordinated to all obligations of
our non-guaranteeing subsidiaries to the extent of the assets of such subsidiaries.

The indentures setting forth the terms of our senior secured notes contain provisions limiting our
ability to redeem such senior secured notes and the terms by which we may do so. Certain series of the
senior secured notes may also be redeemed, in whole or in part, at certain redemption prices set forth in


-----

the applicable indentures, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we, at our option, may
redeem any series of our senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes, in whole or
in part, at any time on or prior to the date specified in the applicable indenture at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth
in the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption
date. At any time or from time to time we, at our option, may redeem any series of our senior secured
first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth
in the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption
date.

In addition, we may be required to purchase for cash all or any part of each series of our senior
secured notes upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the applicable indenture) for a
cash purchase price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such senior secured notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest.

**Senior Unsecured Notes**

As of September 30, 2021, we had $4.734 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured
notes outstanding. All of our senior unsecured notes are general senior unsecured debt obligations that
rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness, but are effectively
subordinated to our senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes, described
above, the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our Credit Agreement and our LC
Facility to the extent of the collateral securing such obligations. Our $1.872 billion aggregate principal
amount of 6.750% Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2023. Interest on our 6.750% Senior Notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year to holders of record on the
immediately preceding June 1 and December 1. Our $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.125%
Senior Notes will mature on October 1, 2028. Interest on our 6.125% Senior Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately
preceding March 15 and September 15. Our $362 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior
Notes will mature on November 15, 2031. Interest on our 6.875% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually
in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding
May 1 and November 1.

We may redeem any series of our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium specified in
the applicable indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

_As used in this “Description of the Notes,” the terms “Tenet,” “we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company” refer_
_to Tenet Healthcare Corporation and not to any of our Subsidiaries. You can find the definition of certain_
_other terms used in this description under the subheading “—Definitions.”_

On the Issue Date, Tenet will issue $1,450,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its    % Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2030 (solely for the purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” the “Notes”)
pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 6, 2001 (as supplemented from time to time prior to the
Issue Date, the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of the Issue
Date (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), between
Tenet, the Subsidiary Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the “Trustee”).
Except as described below, the terms of the Notes will include those terms stated in the Indenture and
those terms made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(which we refer to as the “TIA”). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and you should refer to the
Indenture and the TIA for a statement thereof.

The Notes will be issued in fully registered form, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, registered in the name of Cede & Co., a nominee of DTC. See
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” The paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for the Notes will be the
corporate trust department of the Trustee in New York, New York. Payment of principal will be made at
maturity in immediately payable funds against surrender to the Trustee.

The summary of the material provisions of the Indenture in this “Description of the Notes” is not
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Indenture, including the definitions therein of
terms used below. Upon request, you may obtain a copy of each Indenture from us.

The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that may be issued
thereunder. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, we may, without the consent of the
holders of the Notes, issue additional notes under the Indenture having the same terms in all respects as
the Notes except for payment of interest (1) scheduled and paid prior to the date of issuance of those
additional notes or (2) payable on the first interest payment date following the date of their issuance.

**Ranking**

The Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) will guarantee the Notes on a senior first-lien basis.
The Notes and the related guarantees will be Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ senior secured firstlien obligations and will rank senior to all of Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future
subordinated indebtedness and, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) securing
the Notes, be effectively senior to Tenet’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future
indebtedness secured on a more junior basis and unsecured indebtedness and other unsecured
liabilities.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will be initially limited to the aggregate principal amount of $1,450,000,000.

We may from time to time, without giving notice to or seeking the consent of the holders of the Notes,
issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as
the Notes offered hereby. Any such additional notes having such terms, together with the Notes offered
hereby, will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture, provided that such additional notes
are fungible with the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Notes will mature on       , 2030.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page hereof and will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on         and         of each year, commencing on       ,
2022, to holders of record on the immediately preceding         and        . Interest on the Notes


-----

will accrue from the most recent date through which interest has been paid on the Notes or, if no interest
has been paid, from the date of original issuance of the Notes.

Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. Principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at our office or agency
maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York, or payment of interest may be made
by check mailed to the holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of
holders of Notes; provided that all payments with respect to Notes as to which the holders have given
wire transfer instructions to the paying agent on or prior to the relevant record date will be required to be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by such holders. Until
otherwise designated by us, our office or agency in New York will be the office of the Trustee maintained
for such purpose.

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior first-lien basis by each of our current and future direct and
indirect Subsidiaries organized in a jurisdiction in the United States that (i) owns or operates a hospital or
(ii) has a direct or indirect equity ownership interest in a Subsidiary that owns or operates a hospital, other
than, in each of the cases (i) and (ii), any such Subsidiary that is a non-wholly owned Subsidiary if the
organizational documents thereof or related joint venture or similar agreements, or applicable law, would
(A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly
owned Subsidiaries) or (B) upon the making of such guarantee, trigger in favor of the equity holders
thereof (other than us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) rights in respect of the Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and such guarantees, the “Subsidiary Guarantees”).
These Subsidiary Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors and will
rank equally to the guarantees of the LC Facility and our other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and all
other unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under
its Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Subsidiary Guarantee from
constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law.

The Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released:

(1) with respect to the Notes upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations under
the Indenture, with respect to the Notes;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary
Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) or upon the sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not
prohibited by the Indenture;

(3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture
Transaction, but only if (i) the organizational documents thereof or related joint venture or similar
agreements, or applicable law, would (A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of the
equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) or (B) such guarantee
would trigger in favor of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly owned
Subsidiaries) rights in respect of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary, and (ii) such Subsidiary
does not guarantee any other capital markets Debt; provided, however, that the preceding clause
(ii) shall be deemed to be satisfied if such Subsidiary is no longer required to guarantee any
capital markets Debt;

(4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction that is not prohibited
by the Indenture; or

(5) with respect to the Notes upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes as provided below under the caption “—
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”_


-----

**Security**

The Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with $770 million aggregate principal amount of our
4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our
4.625% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024, $700 million aggregate principal amount of our
7.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025, $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.875%
Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2026, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2027, $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2028, $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior
Secured First Lien Notes due 2029 and obligations outstanding under our LC Facility and secured by a
first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of our Domestic Hospital
Subsidiaries (the “Collateral”). The Notes will not be secured by any hospital or other property or asset of
us or our Subsidiaries.

We and the Collateral trustee will execute an additional secured debt designation thereby designating
the obligations with respect to the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees as “First-Priority Stock Secured
Debt” under the collateral trust agreement that we and certain of the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into
with the Trustee and the Collateral trustee on March 3, 2009 (the “collateral trust agreement”). The effect
of such designation shall be to include the obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary
Guarantees within the secured obligations covered by the stock pledge agreement dated March 3, 2009
(as amended or supplemented from time to time, including by the first amendment to the pledge
agreement dated May 8, 2009, the second amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 15, 2009,
the pledge amendment dated May 15, 2013, the pledge amendment dated October 1, 2013, the third
amendment to the pledge agreement dated March 7, 2014, the fourth amendment to the pledge
agreement dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment dated March 23, 2015, the pledge amendment
dated October 5, 2015, the fifth amendment to the pledge agreement dated December 1, 2016, the sixth
amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 14, 2017, the seventh amendment to the pledge
agreement dated February 5, 2019, the eighth amendment to the pledge agreement dated August 26,
2019, the ninth amendment to the pledge agreement dated April 7, 2020, the tenth amendment to the
pledge agreement dated June 16, 2020, an eleventh amendment to the pledge agreement dated June 2,
2021 and a twelfth amendment to be dated as of the Issue Date, the “pledge agreement”) on a first
priority basis to the obligations covered by the pledge agreement on the Issue Date. The pledge
agreement defines the terms of the pledges that secure the Notes. These pledges will secure the
payment and performance when due of all of our obligations under the Indenture and the Notes as
provided in the pledge agreement. We, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Collateral trustee will execute
an amendment to the pledge agreement, to be dated the date of the Issue Date (the “pledge
amendment”).

The collateral trust agreement sets forth the terms on which the Collateral will be received, held,
administered, maintained and enforced and the terms on which the proceeds of all Liens upon the Capital
Stock pledged as collateral at any time in respect of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the
Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt shall be distributed, in trust for the benefit of the present and future
holders of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt.

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will be substantially limited by the
terms of the lien ranking provisions set forth in the collateral trust agreement, even during an event of
default. Under the collateral trust agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to or in respect
of the Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against
the Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings and the approval of amendments to, and
waivers of past defaults under documents relating to the Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders
of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens on the
Collateral.

So long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms
and conditions, we and our Subsidiaries will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other
payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by us and to exercise any voting and other
consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral pledged by us.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default or event of default:


-----

(1) all of our rights to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will cease, and all such rights
will become vested in the Collateral trustee, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the
sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights;

(2) all of our rights to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with
respect to the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other payments will be
paid to the Collateral trustee; and

(3) the Collateral trustee may sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the
terms of the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement. The Collateral trustee in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the collateral trust agreement will distribute
all funds distributed under the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and received
by the Collateral trustee for the benefit of the holders of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and
the Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt.

The collateral trust agreement governs the terms on which the Collateral may be disposed of,
including, but not limited to, the terms on which all or any portion of the Collateral may be released from
the Liens created by the pledge agreement and the collateral trust agreement and the terms on which the
Collateral may be foreclosed upon following a default or event of default.

The pledge of the Capital Stock of a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary as it relates to the Notes and the
Subsidiary Guarantees will be released:

(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations under the Indenture and the
Notes;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary
(including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) us or a Subsidiary of ours in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture;

(3) upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary (including
by way of merger or consolidation) in connection with a Permitted Joint Venture Transaction, but
only with respect to the Capital Stock sold in such transaction or as otherwise contemplated by
the definition of Permitted Joint Venture Transaction;

(4) upon liquidation and dissolution of that Subsidiary in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture;

(5) in respect of pledged Capital Stock owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary
Guarantor has been released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; or

(6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as
provided below under the caption “—Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

We will comply with the applicable provisions of TIA § 314.

To the extent applicable, we will cause TIA § 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA § 314(d), relating to
the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to
be subjected to the Lien of the security documents, to be complied with. Any certificate or opinion
required by TIA § 314(d) may be made by an officer of Tenet except in cases where TIA § 314(d) requires
that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent
engineer, appraiser or other expert selected by Tenet.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, we will not be required to
comply with all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) if we determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel,
that under the terms of TIA § 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of
the SEC and its staff, including “no action” letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA § 314(d) is
inapplicable to one or a series of released collateral.


-----

The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Liens we can create on the Collateral securing the
Notes as well as on our other assets as described under the caption “—Limitations on Us and Our
_Subsidiaries—Limitations on Liens.” The Credit Agreement permits us to refinance our existing_
unsecured Senior Debt through the issuance of various forms of debt, including secured debt. Under the
Credit Agreement, we may refinance unsecured Senior Debt with secured debt if the secured leverage
ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) after giving pro forma effect to such refinancing would be less
than 4.0 to 1.0 for the most recently ended four consecutive fiscal quarters.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth in the following paragraph, we may not redeem the Notes prior to       , 2024.
On and after such date, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at our option, at the following
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof), plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period (or, in
the case of the period commencing on       , 2026, such 12-month period and thereafter)
commencing on         of the years set forth below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2024 ..................................................................................................................................... %
2025 ..................................................................................................................................... %
2026 and thereafter ............................................................................................................. 100.000%

At any time prior to       , 2024, the Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time, at
our option, at a redemption price calculated by us equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.

**Redemption of Notes with Net Cash Proceeds of Qualified Equity Offerings**

At any time or from time to time prior to       , 2024, we, at our option, may redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture, with the net cash proceeds of
one or more Qualified Equity Offerings at a redemption price equal to    % of the principal amount of
the Notes, to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including special interest, if any) thereon, if
any, to the date of redemption; provided that (1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
redemption and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing of any such Qualified Equity
Offering.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Notes will not be subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund provisions.

**Selection and Notice of Redemption**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes for redemption will be
made according to applicable depository procedures; provided that Notes with a principal amount of
$2,000 will not be redeemed in part.

We will deliver a notice of redemption at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the redemption
date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. If any Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice
of redemption that relates to such Notes will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. A replacement Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be
issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.

Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will
cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

Any notice of an optional redemption may, at Tenet’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an equity offering, other offering, incurrence of
indebtedness, or other corporate transaction or event and notice of any redemption in respect thereof


-----

may be given prior to the completion thereof and may be partial as a result of only some of the conditions
being satisfied; provided, however, that any such conditions precedent shall be set forth in the notice of
redemption and that such notice shall state that, in Tenet’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by Tenet in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or
all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Tenet in its sole discretion) by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries**

**_Limitations on Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that neither we nor any of our Subsidiaries will issue, incur, create, assume
or guarantee (collectively, “incur”) with respect to any specified person (as defined in the Indenture), any
debt of such person in respect of borrowed money, including guarantees (as defined in the Indenture)
related thereto (“Debt”) secured by Liens upon property or assets (including the Collateral), unless at the
time of and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt, the aggregate amount of all such secured
debt (including the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at such time) shall not exceed the
greater of (x) $9.5 billion and (y) the amount which would cause the Secured Debt Ratio to exceed 4.0 to
1.0. If any such secured debt (other than Permitted Credit Agreement Debt) is secured by property or
assets other than the Collateral, we must equally and ratably secure the Notes with, or prior to, such
Debt; provided that up to $500.0 million of such secured debt (“Other Secured Debt”) is not subject to the
equal and ratable security requirement in this sentence. To the extent that we or any of our Subsidiaries
incur any additional Debt permitted under this restriction (other than Other Secured Debt) that is secured
by a Lien (pari passu to the Lien securing the Notes) or junior Lien on any property or assets (which we
are permitted to do, subject to the foregoing limitation), such Liens shall be subject to the collateral trust
agreement.

The foregoing restriction will not apply to any of the following:

  - Liens securing Permitted Credit Agreement Debt;

  - Liens in favor of us or a Domestic Hospital Subsidiary;

  - Liens existing on the Issue Date;

  - certain Liens to governmental entities;

  - Liens incurred within 90 days (or any longer period, not in excess of one year, as permitted by
law), after acquisition of the related property arising solely in connection with the transfer of tax
benefits in accordance with Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended;

  - any substitution or replacement of any Lien referred to above, provided that the property
encumbered by any substitute or replacement Lien is similar in nature and value to the property
encumbered by the Lien that is being replaced, as determined in good faith by an officer of the
Company; and

  - any extension, renewal or replacement of any Lien referred to above or any Lien incurred in
compliance with the first paragraph above, provided the amount secured is not increased and it
relates to the same property.

**_Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions_**

The Indenture will provide that neither we nor any of our Subsidiaries will enter into any Sale and
Lease-Back Transaction with another Person, other than us or one of our Subsidiary Guarantors, unless:

  - we or any of our Subsidiaries could incur the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and LeaseBack Transaction secured by a Lien on the property to be leased in compliance with the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries—Limitations on Liens”;
and


-----

  - we comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders—Asset Dispositions.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we and any of our Subsidiaries may enter into any Sale and LeaseBack Transaction, provided that the aggregate Attributable Debt in respect of all such Sale and LeaseBack Transactions does not exceed the greater of (x) $650.0 million and (y) 5% of our Consolidated Total
Assets.

**_Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees by Subsidiaries_**

The Indenture will provide that we will not permit any of our Subsidiaries to guarantee any of our Debt
(other than pursuant to any extension, renewal or replacement of any Debt that was so guaranteed that
does not increase the amount of our Debt that is so guaranteed), unless at the time of and after giving
effect to the issuance of such Debt, the aggregate amount of all such guaranteed Debt (including the
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at such time) shall not exceed the greater of
(x) $12.0 billion or (y) 5.0 times the aggregate amount of EBITDA for the most recent four consecutive
fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of determination; provided that, unless the Notes are secured by
substantially all the property and assets (other than accounts receivable and cash) of the guarantors on a
first-priority basis, the aggregate amount of all such Debt guaranteed by guarantees that are not
subordinated to the guarantees of the Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding at such time but excluding guarantees of Permitted Credit Agreement Debt) shall not exceed
the greater of (a) $9.5 billion and (b) taking into account only First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and
Permitted Junior Stock Secured Debt instead of all Secured Debt, 4.0 times the aggregate amount of
EBITDA for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of determination.
The foregoing restriction will not prohibit the issuance of guarantees by any of our Subsidiaries in respect
of Permitted Credit Agreement Debt. For purposes of the foregoing restriction, Debt and EBITDA shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis consistent with the definition of “Secured Debt Ratio.”

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Indenture will provide that we shall cause each newly created or acquired direct or indirect
Subsidiary organized in a jurisdiction in the United States that (i) owns or operates a hospital or (ii) has a
direct or indirect equity ownership interest in a Subsidiary that owns or operates a hospital, other than, in
each of the cases (i) and (ii), any such Subsidiary that is a non-wholly owned Subsidiary if the
organizational documents thereof or related joint venture or similar agreements, or applicable law, would
(A) prohibit such guarantee without the consent of the equity holders thereof (other than us or our wholly
owned Subsidiaries) or (B) upon the making of such guarantee, trigger in favor of the equity holders
thereof (other than us or our wholly owned Subsidiaries) rights in respect of the Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such
Subsidiary will guarantee the Notes.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that we may not consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or
substantially all of our properties and assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person, unless:

  - we are the surviving corporation or the successor is a corporation organized and validly existing
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and expressly
assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all the Notes and the
due and punctual performance and observation of our covenants and obligations under the
Indenture; and

  - immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after
notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of default, has occurred and is continuing
under the Indenture.

The Indenture will also provide that each Subsidiary Guarantor may not, and the Company will not
permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person, unless:


-----

  - such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the successor is a corporation
organized and validly existing under the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly
assumes all of the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guarantee, except in a transaction where the Subsidiary
Guarantee is released; and

  - immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after
notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of default, has occurred and is continuing
under the Indenture;

provided, that a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with, or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to, or merge with or into, any other Subsidiary in connection with a Permitted
Joint Venture Transaction.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Notes will have the right to require us to
repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that
holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth
in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, we will offer a payment in cash (the “Change of Control
Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, we will deliver a notice to each holder describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the
Change of Control Payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date of such Change of Control, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice. We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of
the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with the change of control provisions of the Indenture, we will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under
the change of control provisions of the Indenture, by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment date, we will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an
officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being
purchased by us.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of
the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such Notes issued for surrendered but unpurchased
Notes will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We will
publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment date.

The provisions described above that require us to make a Change of Control Offer following a change
of control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable to the
change of control event. Except as described above with respect to a change of control, the Indenture


-----

does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem
the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and
purchases all Notes properly tendered and not validly withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the
Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of us and
our Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale,
lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of us and our Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this
covenant, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws
or regulations.

The agreements governing our other debt contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions
of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control, and future agreements may
contain prohibitions on repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the Notes. The exercise by the
holders of Notes of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes upon a Change of Control could
cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when we
are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders to the purchase of
such Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain
a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, our
failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which could,
in turn, constitute a default under such other debt.

Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our thenexisting financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may be unable to
_purchase the notes upon a change of control.”_

**_Asset Dispositions_**

We will not, and will not permit any of our Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate any
Asset Disposition unless:

(1) we or such Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal
to the fair market value, as determined in good faith by us, of the shares and assets subject to
such Asset Disposition;

(2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by us or such Subsidiary is in the form of cash
or cash equivalents;

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by us
or such Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent we elect (or are required by the terms of any Debt), to prepay, repay, redeem or
purchase Senior Debt of ours or of a Subsidiary Guarantor or Debt of a Subsidiary that is not


-----

a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than Debt owed to us or one of our Subsidiaries)
within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; or

(B) to the extent we elect, to acquire Additional Assets within one year from the later of the date
of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and

(4) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with
clauses (3)(A) or (3)(B), such balance is applied by us or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, to
make an offer to the holders of the Notes (and to holders of other First-Priority Stock Secured
Debt) to purchase Notes (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to and
subject to the conditions contained in the Indenture;

_provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Debt pursuant to_
clause (3)(A) or (4) above, we or such Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Debt and shall cause the
related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount
so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided, further, however, that, in the case of clause (3)(B) above, a
binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment so long as we or such Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith
expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of
such commitment (an “acceptable commitment”); provided, further that if any acceptable commitment is
later canceled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net
Available Cash shall be applied pursuant to clause (4) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, we and such Subsidiaries will
not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with the preceding paragraph except to
the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions subject to the preceding
paragraph which is not applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph exceeds $100.0 million.
Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash may be
used in any other manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:

(1) the assumption or discharge of Debt or other liabilities of ours or any Subsidiary and the release
of us or such Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt or other liability in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(2) securities or other obligations received by us or any Subsidiary from the transferee that are
converted by us or such Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Disposition, to the
extent of the cash received in that conversion;

(3) Additional Assets; and

(4) Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by us or any of our Subsidiaries in such Asset
Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated NonCash Consideration received pursuant to this proviso that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed 5% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash
Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.

In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of any Notes (and other First-Priority
Stock Secured Debt), we will purchase the Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by us for the Notes (and
such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in
the event such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt was issued with significant original issue discount,
100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of
such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, such other price, not to exceed 100%, as may be provided
for by the terms of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) in accordance with the procedures
(including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If there remains a balance
of Net Available Cash after purchasing all securities tendered, then such balance may be used in any
manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered
exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, we will select the securities to be purchased


-----

on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of
$2,000 principal amount or any greater integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We shall not be
required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant
to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $100.0 million (which lesser
amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with
respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an
offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such
offer.

We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of any Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of this covenant, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not
be deemed to have breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of our compliance with such
securities laws or regulations. The agreements governing our other debt contain, and future agreements
may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Disposition,
and future agreements may contain prohibitions on repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the
Notes. The exercise by the holders of Notes of their right to require us to repurchase such Notes upon an
Asset Disposition could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Disposition itself
does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs
at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could seek the consent of our senior lenders
to the purchase of such Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes.
In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other debt. Finally, our ability to pay cash to
the holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then-existing financial resources.

**_SEC Reports_**

If, at any time, we are no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
for any reason, we will nevertheless continue to file with the SEC for public availability within the time
periods that would have been applicable if we were subject to such reporting requirements:

(1) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q
and 10-K if we were required to file such reports; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if we were required
to file such reports.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and
regulations applicable to such reports. Each annual report on Form 10-K will include a report on our
consolidated financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm.

**Events of Default**

Under the Indenture, each of the following constitutes an event of default with respect to the Notes:

  - failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes, at maturity or otherwise;

  - failure to pay any interest on the Notes when due, continued for 30 days;

  - the failure by us for 30 days after notice to comply with the provisions described under the caption
“--Repurchase at the Option of Holders” with respect to the Notes;

  - failure to perform, or the breach of, any of our other covenants in the Indenture or the Notes,
continued for 90 days after written notice;

  - with respect to any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $100.0 million, (a) the
security interest under the pledge agreement, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for
any reason other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the pledge agreement
and any other security document; (b) any security interest created under the pledge agreement,


-----

under such other security document or under such Indenture is declared invalid or unenforceable
by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) we or any Subsidiary asserts, in any pleading in any
court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest is invalid or unenforceable;

  - any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Notes of a “significant subsidiary” or a group of
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a “significant subsidiary” (as “significant
subsidiary” is defined under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) shall for any reason cease to be, or
shall for any reason be asserted in writing by any Subsidiary Guarantor or us not to be, in full
force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated
by the Indenture with respect to the Notes and any such Subsidiary Guarantee; or

  - certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur with respect to us, a Subsidiary
Guarantor that is a “significant subsidiary” or a group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken
together, would constitute a “significant subsidiary.”

In addition to the events of default set forth above, an event of default will be deemed to have
occurred with respect to the Notes in the event of a failure to pay at maturity or the acceleration of our
indebtedness or indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor having an aggregate principal amount in excess
of the greater of $100.0 million or 5% of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets under the terms of the
instrument under which that indebtedness is issued or secured if that indebtedness is not discharged or
the acceleration is not annulled within 10 days after written notice.

If any event of default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to us and to
the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Notes will automatically and without any action
by the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable. After any such acceleration, but
before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of any Notes then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such
acceleration if all events of default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal of or interest on
the Notes, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee in case an event of
default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it. Subject to such provisions for the
indemnification of the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any
remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to
the Notes.

No holder of a Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for
the appointment of a receiver or a trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless:

  - such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing event of default with
respect to the Notes;

  - the holders of at least 25% in the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding have
made written request, and such holder or holders have offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as Trustee; and

  - the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding and the Trustee has not received from the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction
inconsistent with such request within 60 days after such notice, request and offer.

Such limitations, however, do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement
of payment of the principal of or interest on such Note on or after its due date.


-----

**Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

We may elect, at our option at any time, to have the provisions of the Indenture relating to
defeasance and discharge of indebtedness and to defeasance of certain restrictive covenants applied to
the Notes.

_Defeasance and Discharge. The Indenture will provide that, upon the exercise of our option, we will_
be discharged from all our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantors’
obligations with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantees (except for certain obligations to exchange or
register the transfer of Notes, to replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes, to maintain paying agencies and
to hold moneys for payment in trust), and the Lien on the Collateral shall be released subject to the
conditions precedent below (“Legal Defeasance”).

_Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The Indenture will provide that, upon the exercise of our option_
with respect to any Notes, we may omit to comply with certain restrictive covenants, including those
described under “—Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries” and “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”
above, and the occurrence of certain events of default will be deemed not to be or result in an event of
default, in each case with respect to such Notes, subject to the conditions precedent below.

In each case, the defeasance provision will be subject to our depositing in trust for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes money or U.S. government obligations, or both, which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized certified public accounting firm, through the payment of principal and interest in respect
thereof in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of
and any premium and interest on such Notes on the stated maturity in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and such Notes. We will also be required, among other things, to deliver to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel (which, in the case of Legal Defeasance, will be based on a ruling secured from or
published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law since the Issue Date) to the effect that beneficial owners of such Notes will not recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge were not to occur.

In the event we exercised this option with respect to any Notes and such Notes were declared due
and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default, the amount of money and
U.S. government obligations so deposited in trust would be sufficient to pay amounts due on such Notes
at the time of their respective stated maturities but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on such
Notes upon any acceleration resulting from such event of default. In such case, we would remain liable
for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture**

The Indenture shall upon company request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving
rights of registration of transfer or exchange of notes herein expressly provided for in the Indenture), and
the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture, when

  - either

    - all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Notes which have been
destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid and (ii) Notes for whose
payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the
Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

    - all such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due
and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense,
of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an


-----

amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the
date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the
stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;

  - the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company;
and

  - the Company has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any
related Subsidiary Guarantee may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes), and any existing default or compliance with
certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer for such Notes).

Without the consent of each holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any
Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

  - reduce the principal or change the fixed maturity of such Note;

  - reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest on such Note;

  - waive a default or event of default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on
such Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by the holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

  - change the place of payment of such Note or make such Note payable in money other than that
stated in the Note;

  - impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such
Note;

  - make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past defaults or the
rights of holders of such Notes to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on such Notes;

  - reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver; or

  - make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions, except to increase the
required percentage or to provide that other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or
waived without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note.

In addition, without the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes
then outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not modify the pledge agreement, any other
security document or the provisions of the Indenture dealing with the pledge or the application of trust
moneys, or otherwise release any Collateral, in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes
(as determined by us in an officer’s certificate delivered to the Trustee) other than in accordance with the
Indenture and the pledge agreement or the security document.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, we, together with the
Trustee, may amend or supplement the Indenture to:


-----

  - cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, provided that such action does not adversely affect
the holders of the Notes in any material respect;

  - provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

  - evidence the assumption of our obligations to holders of the Notes in the case of a merger,
consolidation or sale of assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—
_Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;_

  - add covenants for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon us;

  - make any change that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture with respect
to the Notes of any such holder in any material respect;

  - add any additional events of default for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

  - make, complete or confirm any grant of collateral permitted or required by the Indenture with
respect to the Notes or any of the security documents or any release of collateral that becomes
effective as set forth in the Indenture with respect to the Notes or any of the security documents;

  - establish the form or terms of other series of debt securities as permitted under the Indenture with
respect to the Notes;

  - comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the
Indenture with respect to the Notes under the TIA; or

  - appoint a successor Trustee.

Except in certain limited circumstances, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for the
purpose of determining the holders of Notes entitled to give or take any direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action or to vote on any action under the Indenture, in the manner and subject to the limitations
provided in such Indenture. In certain limited circumstances, the Trustee will be entitled to set a record
date for action by holders. If a record date is set for any action to be taken by holders, such action may
be taken only by Persons who are holders of outstanding Notes on the record date. To be effective, the
action must be taken by holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes within a specified period
following the record date. For any particular record date, this period will be 180 days or such shorter
period as may be specified by us (or the Trustee, if it set the record date), and may be shortened or
lengthened from time to time, but not beyond 180 days.

**The Trustee**

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is trustee under the Indenture.

We maintain banking relations with The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A. In addition, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is successor
trustee under other indentures pursuant to which we have issued debt. If a default should occur with
respect to the Notes at any time when the TIA is applicable, the Trustee would be required to eliminate
any conflicting interest as defined in the TIA or resign as Trustee within 90 days of such default unless
such default were cured, duly waived or otherwise eliminated.

The Trustee may resign at any time or may be removed by us, in each case upon thirty days’ prior
written notice. If the Trustee resigns, is removed or becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or if a
vacancy occurs in the office of the Trustee for any cause, a successor Trustee shall be appointed in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that in case an event of
default occurs (and is not cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the
degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee
will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any
holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense.


-----

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes will provide that they are and shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.

**Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. We refer you to the Indenture for a
full disclosure of all such terms, as well as any other capitalized terms used in this section of the offering
memorandum for which no definition is provided.

“Additional Assets” means:

(1) any property, plant or equipment or other assets or capital expenditures used in a Related
Business or that replace the assets that were the subject of the Asset Disposition;

(2) the Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of such
Capital Stock by us or another Subsidiary; or

(3) Capital Stock in any Person that at such time is a Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that any such Subsidiary described in clause (2) or (3) above is primarily engaged_
in a Related Business or replaces the assets that were the subject of the Asset Disposition.

“Adjusted Treasury Rate” means, as obtained by us, with respect to any redemption date:

(1) the average of the yields in each statistical release for the immediately preceding week
designated “H.15” or any successor publication which is published by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury
securities adjusted to constant maturity under “U.S. government securities—Treasury constant
_maturities— nominal,” for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; or_

(2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the
Calculation Date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual
equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue 2024 First Lien Notes, calculated
using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal
amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.

The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption
date; or, in the case of a satisfaction and discharge or a defeasance, on the third business day prior to the
date on which the Company deposits the amount required under the Indenture.

“Applicable Premium” means, as determined by the Company with respect to any Note on any
redemption date, the greater of:

(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(2) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of
such Note on       , 2024 (as set forth in the table under “—Optional Redemption”), plus
(ii) all required interest payments due on such Note through       , 2024 (excluding accrued
but unpaid interest and special interest (if any) described herein under the section entitled
“Registration Rights” to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the
Adjusted Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal
amount of such Note.

“Asset Disposition” means any sale, lease, transfer or other voluntary disposition (or series of
related sales, leases, transfers or dispositions) by us or any of our Subsidiaries, including any disposition


-----

by means of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction (each referred to for the purposes of this
definition as a “disposition”), of:

(1) any shares of Capital Stock of one of our Subsidiaries (other than directors’ qualifying shares or
shares required by applicable law to be held by a Person other than us or one of our
Subsidiaries);

(2) all or substantially all the assets of any division or line of business of ours or any of our
Subsidiaries; or

(3) any other assets of ours or any of our Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business of
us or such Subsidiary;

other than, in the case of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above,

(A) a disposition by a Subsidiary to us or by us or any Subsidiary to a Subsidiary Guarantor or by any
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to any Subsidiary;

forma calculations shall be made in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, as

-----

**REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

On the Issue Date of the notes, we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a registration rights
agreement for the notes with the initial purchasers, pursuant to which we and the Subsidiary Guarantors
will agree, for the respective benefit of the holders of the notes, that if any notes are not freely tradable
(as defined below) as of the 380th day after the Issue Date, which date we refer to as the “free trade
date,” we, and the Subsidiary Guarantors will, at our own expense, use all commercially reasonable
efforts to file a registration statement, which we refer to as an “exchange offer registration statement,” with
respect to a registered exchange offer, which we refer to as the “exchange offer,” to exchange the notes
for replacement notes with terms identical in all material respects to the notes (we refer to the notes to be
issued in the exchange offer as the “exchange notes”), to cause such exchange offer registration
statement to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act and to consummate such
exchange offer, provided that our obligation to file an exchange offer registration statement with respect
to any notes will cease as soon as such notes become freely tradable.

“Freely tradable” means, with respect to the notes, notes (a) that are eligible to be sold by a person
who has not been our affiliate during the preceding three months without any volume or manner of sale
restrictions under the Securities Act, (b) for which we have provided a certificate to the Trustee instructing
the Trustee that the restricted legend thereon no longer applies, and (c) that have been assigned an
unrestricted CUSIP number.

In accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, notes held by holders who are
not “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us will be freely tradable without any
volume or manner of sale restrictions if, among other things, such notes have been held by such holder
for at least six months and we have filed all reports required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the 12 months prior to the free trade date.

If we are required to effect an exchange offer, once such exchange offer registration statement has
been declared effective, we and the Subsidiary Guarantors will offer the applicable exchange notes in
exchange for surrender of the notes. We and the Subsidiary Guarantors will keep such exchange offer
open for at least 20 business days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date that notice of
such exchange offer is mailed to holders of the notes. For each note surrendered to us pursuant to such
exchange offer, the holder who surrendered such note will receive an exchange note having a principal
amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest on each exchange note will accrue from the last
interest payment date on which interest was paid on the note surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no
interest has been paid on such new note, from the original issue date of such note.

Under existing interpretations of the Securities Act by the SEC contained in several “no-action” letters
to third parties, and subject to the immediately following sentence, we believe that the exchange notes
would generally be freely transferable by holders thereof after the applicable exchange offer without
further registration under the Securities Act (subject to certain representations required to be made by
each holder of notes, as set forth below). However, any holder of notes who is an “affiliate” (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us or any Subsidiary Guarantor and any holder of notes who
intends to participate in such exchange offer for the purpose of distributing exchange notes (1) will not be
able to rely on the interpretation of the staff of the SEC, (2) will not be able to tender its notes in the
exchange offer and (3) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act in connection with any sale or transfer of the notes unless such sale or transfer is made
pursuant to an exemption from such requirements.

In addition, in connection with any resales of exchange notes, any broker dealer, which we refer to as
an “exchanging broker dealer,” that acquires exchange notes in such exchange offer in exchange for
notes acquired for its own account as a result of market making or other trading activities must deliver a
prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act. The SEC has taken the position that
exchanging broker dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to those
exchange notes with the prospectus contained in the exchange offer registration statement. We will
agree to make available for a period of up to 180 days after consummation of such exchange offer a
prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act to any exchanging broker dealer and any other
persons with similar prospectus delivery requirements, for use in connection with any resale of the
applicable exchange notes. An exchanging broker dealer or any other person that delivers such a
prospectus to purchasers in connection with such resales will be subject to certain of the civil liability


-----

provisions under the Securities Act and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights
agreement (including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder).

Each holder of notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange notes for
exchange notes in the applicable exchange offer will be required to make certain representations,
including representations that (1) any exchange notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary
course of its business, (2) it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the
distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the exchange notes, (3) it is not an “affiliate” (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of us, and (4) it is not acting on behalf of any person who
could not truthfully make the foregoing representations.

Although we intend to cause the notes to become freely tradable on or prior to the free trade date or
consummate such exchange offer on the terms and timetable described above, we cannot assure you
that we will be able to do so. In the event that the notes do not become freely tradable on or prior to the
free trade date, the interest rate borne by the notes will be increased by one quarter of one percent per
annum for the first 90-day period and thereafter it will be increased by an additional one quarter of one
percent per annum for each 90-day period that elapses; provided that the aggregate increase in such
annual interest rate may in no event exceed one percent. Such additional interest will not accrue for our
failure to provide a certificate to the Trustee instructing it that the restricted legend on the notes no longer
applies unless we have received a request to do so by a holder of the notes or the Trustee on or after the
380th day after the Issue Date; provided that if we receive such a request on or after the fifth business
day immediately preceding the free trade date and the restricted legend on the notes has not been
removed by the close of business on the fifth business day thereafter, additional interest will accrue on
the notes until (1) the notes become freely tradable or (2) such exchange offer registration statement has
been declared effective and the exchange offer has been consummated for the notes. Once all
outstanding notes have become freely tradable or all notes tendered into such exchange offer have been
exchanged for exchange notes that are freely tradable (other than exchange notes held by exchanging
broker dealers), special interest will cease to accrue.

This summary of certain provisions of the registration rights agreements does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the complete provisions of the registration
rights agreement, copies of which we will make available to holders of notes upon request.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**The global notes**

The notes will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form, without interest coupons (the
“global notes”), as follows:

  - notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (each a “QIB”) under
Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global note;

  - notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be
represented by the Regulation S global note; and

  - any notes sold in the secondary market to institutional accredited investors will be represented by
the Institutional Accredited Investor global note.

Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts
with DTC (“DTC participants”) or persons who hold interests through DTC participants. We expect that
under procedures established by DTC:

  - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal
amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial
purchasers; and

  - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership
of those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to
interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners
of beneficial interests in the global note).

Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear
Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on behalf of the owners of such interests.

Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global notes directly through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are
participants in those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S global note
through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear
and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the
Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of
its participants.

Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form
except in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each
global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors” beginning on
page 49 of this offering memorandum.

**Exchanges among the global notes**

The distribution compliance period required by Regulation S (the “Distribution Compliance Period”)
will begin on the Issue Date and end 40 days after the Issue Date. During the Distribution Compliance
Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons
under Regulation S, persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or
institutional accredited investors.

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global
note. Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance
Period, and to which global note the transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide
certain written certifications in the form provided in the applicable indenture. In addition, in the case of a
transfer of interests to the Institutional Accredited Investor global note, the Trustee may require the buyer


-----

to deliver a representation letter in the form provided in the applicable indenture that states, among other
things, that the buyer is not acquiring notes with a view to distributing them in violation of the Securities
Act.

A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another
global note will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in the other global note.

Pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the applicable notes will be issued, upon our
satisfaction that the notes are no longer required to bear a restricted Securities Act legend in order to
maintain compliance with the Securities Act, we may, at our option, take the necessary action such that
holders of notes bearing a restricted Securities Act legend may automatically exchange such notes for
notes that do not bear a restricted Securities Act legend at any time on or after the 366th calendar day
after the Issue Date of the notes.

**Book-entry procedures for the global notes**

All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by
that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee, or the initial
purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC has advised us that it is:

  - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

  - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

  - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

  - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

  - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of
its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers;
banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s
system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect
participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or
indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of
DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered
the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture.
Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note:

  - will not be entitled to have notes represented by the global note registered in their names;

  - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and

  - will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indentures for any purpose,
including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under
the indentures.

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures
of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the indentures (and, if the investor is not a
participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the
investor owns its interest).


-----

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the notes represented by a global
note will be made by the Trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither
we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of
beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on
account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC
relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a
global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the
responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be affected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in
same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be affected in the
ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be affected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting
as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a
Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the
established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final
settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or
receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting
for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or
Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value
on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as
of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of
interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement
systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures
at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules
and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated notes**

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as
a beneficial owner of the related notes only if:

  - DTC notifies us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global
notes and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

  - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor
depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

  - we, at our option, notify the Trustee that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes; or

  - certain other events provided for in the indenture should occur.

the initial purchasers, Tenet has agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and each of the initial purchasers
has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from Tenet, the principal amount of the notes set forth
opposite its name below:

**Principal Amount of**

**Notes to be**

**Total ....................................................................................................................** $ 1,450,000,000

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of
these notes are purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the
purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased, or the purchase
agreement may be terminated.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect
of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The initial purchasers have advised us that they propose initially to offer the notes at the offering price
set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any
other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through
certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial
purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the
Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and
Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably
believe to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or pursuant to offers and sales to nonU.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until
40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by
a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to
have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors”
beginning on page 49 of this offering memorandum.


-----

**New Issues of Notes**

The notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply
for listing of any of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any
automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they
presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under
no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice.
We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for any of the notes. If an active trading market for
any of the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of such notes may be adversely affected.
If any of the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial
condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about       , 2021, which will
be the      business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being
referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are
required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date hereof or in the next    business days will
be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+  , to specify an alternate settlement
arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who
wish to trade the notes on the date hereof or in the next      business days should consult their
advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

During the period of 30 days from the date hereof, we will not, without the prior written consent of
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell or contract, grant any option for
the sale, pledge, transfer of, or otherwise dispose of, or announce the offering of, or file any registration
statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of the Company that are similar to
any of the notes, or any debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for debt securities of the
Company that are similar to the notes (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement and to
register the exchange notes (as defined under “Registration Rights”)).

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover
positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater
principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must
close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be
created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the
notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short
sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding
a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price
that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction
or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the representatives will
engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued
without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined


-----

in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.
This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. This offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in the UK
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

This document is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the

is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only
to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Singapore**

This offering memorandum has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. Accordingly, this offering memorandum and any other document or material in connection
with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the notes may not be circulated or
distributed, nor may the notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription
or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional
investor under Section 274 of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the “SFA”), (ii) to
a relevant person, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A), and in accordance with the conditions,
specified in Section 275 of the SFA or (iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions
of, any other applicable provision of the SFA.

Where the notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 by a relevant person which is: (a) a
corporation (which is not an accredited investor) the sole business of which is to hold investments and the
entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor;


-----

or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments
and each beneficiary is an accredited investor, shares, debentures and units of shares and debentures of
that corporation or the beneficiaries’ rights and interest in that trust shall not be transferable for six
months after that corporation or that trust has acquired the notes under Section 275 except: (1) to an
institutional investor under Section 274 of the SFA or to a relevant person, or any person pursuant to
Section 275(1A), and in accordance with the conditions, specified in Section 275 of the SEA; (2) where no

notes are “prescribed capital markets products” (as defined in the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets
Products) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in MAS Notice SFA 04-N12:
Notice on the Sale of Investment Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on
Investment Products).

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. Some of the initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the
future engage in, financial advisory, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary
course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary
fees and commissions for these transactions. Affiliates of the initial purchasers from time to time have
acted or in the future may continue to act as agents and lenders to us and our affiliates and subsidiaries
under our or their respective credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement, for which services they have
received or expect to receive customary compensation. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are
agents and/or participants under the LC Facility. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC has acted as advisor to us in
connection with the Acquisition and is advising us in connection with Conifer-related matters.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending
relationship with us routinely hedge, certain of the other initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a
lending relationship with us may hedge, and certain of the other initial purchasers or their affiliates that
have a lending relationship with us are likely to hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps
or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly,
the notes are being offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional
buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) (“QIBs”) in compliance with Rule 144A and
(2) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in
this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used herein as
defined therein):

(2) The purchaser understands that the notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any
public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the notes have
not been and, except as described in this offering memorandum, will not be registered under the
Securities Act and that

substantially to the following effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY
ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF OR OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, THE ACQUIRER

(1) REPRESENTS THAT

OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE OR ANY BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, EXCEPT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ONLY

(A) TO THE COMPANY,

RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS,
CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO
DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE
AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ANY RULE 144 EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

By acceptance of a note or an exchange note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes or the exchange notes constitutes assets of any
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are
subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or provisions
under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions
(“Similar Laws”) or entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such
plan, account or arrangement or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the notes and the exchange
notes (and the exchange of notes for exchange notes) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute
a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Company, the initial purchasers or any of
their affiliates is acting as a fiduciary with respect to such acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes or
exchange notes (or exchange thereof).


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes and
exchange notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, plans, individual retirement
accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any
federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions (“Similar
Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan,
account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General fiduciary matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA
Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of
the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes and exchange notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary
should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing
the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited transaction issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the
meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.
In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction
may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of
notes or exchange notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the issuer, the initial purchasers, or the
guarantors are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or
indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual
prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited
transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These
class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by
independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house
asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide
relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain
transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly)
have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the
assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no
more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all
of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes and
exchange notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan,
unless such purchase and holding (and the exchange of notes for exchange notes) will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar
Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note or an exchange note, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used


-----

by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes or the exchange notes constitutes assets of
any Plan or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the notes and the exchange notes (and the
exchange of notes for exchange notes) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any
applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Company, the initial purchasers or any of their affiliates is acting
as a fiduciary with respect to such acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes or exchange notes (or
exchange thereof).

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the notes or exchange notes (and holding the notes or exchange notes) on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be
applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

This section summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase,
ownership, and disposition of the notes. This summary does not provide a complete analysis of all
potential tax considerations. The information provided below is based on the Code, Treasury Regulations
issued under the Code, judicial authority and administrative rulings and practice, all as of the date of this
offering memorandum and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly on a
retroactive basis. As a result, the tax considerations of purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes
could differ from those described below. This summary deals only with notes purchased for cash in this
offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes are sold for
cash to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and held as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion assumes that the notes will not be issued with
original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This summary does not deal with persons in special tax situations, such as banks or financial
institutions, thrifts, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or other pass through entities for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors therein, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, traders or dealers in
securities or currencies, U.S. expatriates or former long-term permanent residents, non-U.S. trusts or
estates with U.S. beneficiaries, persons holding the notes as a position in a “straddle,” “hedge,”
“conversion transaction,” or other integrated transaction for tax purposes, persons who use a mark-tomarket method of accounting, persons who acquired notes in connection with employment or other
performance of services, persons who hold notes in retirement plans or tax-deferred accounts, persons
subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code or U.S. holders (as defined
below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Further, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences under U.S. alternative minimum tax rules, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws, the tax laws
of any U.S. state or locality, any non-U.S. tax laws, or any tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax
laws. We will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the
matters discussed herein, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of
the tax consequences described herein.

As used herein, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,

  - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia,

  - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or

  - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

As used herein, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a
beneficial owner of notes, the treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the
status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment
in the notes and partners in such a partnership should consult their independent tax advisors about the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the notes.

**Investors should consult their tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,**
**ownership and disposition of the notes, including any U.S. federal tax consequences and the tax**


-----

**consequences under the laws of any foreign, state, local or other taxing jurisdictions and the**
**possible effects on investors of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.**

**Payments under Certain Events**

We may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay additional amounts in redemption of or
otherwise on the notes in addition to the stated principal amount of and interest on the notes (see, e.g.,
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of Notes—Redemption of Notes with Net
_Cash Proceeds of Qualified Equity Offerings” and “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of_
_Holders—Change of Control”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position_
that the possibility of payment of such additional amounts does not result in the notes being treated as
contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a holder,
unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the
notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS
takes a contrary position to that described above, a holder may be required to accrue ordinary interest
income on the notes in excess of stated interest, based upon a comparable yield, regardless of the
holder’s method of tax accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed
rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the
notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
the notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income.

**Holders of notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the**
**notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion**
**assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for**
**U.S. federal income tax purposes.**

**U.S. holders**

_Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a note will generally be includable by a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at
the time it accrues or is received in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If, however, the notes are issued for an amount less than the principal amount and
the difference is more than a de minimis amount (as set forth in the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations), a U.S. holder will be required to include the difference in income as original issue discount
as it accrues in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest, before the
receipt of cash payments attributable to this income.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_

Upon the disposition of a note by sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition,
a U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount
realized on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which
will be taxed as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously
included in income) and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the note. A U.S. holder’s gain or loss will generally
constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of disposition, the
U.S. holder has held such note for longer than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
certain limitations. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally
taxed at preferential rates.

_Medicare Tax_

A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special category of trusts
that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on the lesser of (1) the
U.S. holder’s “net investment income” (or, in the case of an estate or trust, “undistributed net investment
income”) for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder’s “modified adjusted gross
income” (or, in the case of an estate or trust, “adjusted gross income”) for the taxable year over a certain
threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000 depending on the


-----

individual’s circumstances). Net investment income will generally include interest income and net gains
from the disposition of the notes, unless such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary
course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain
passive or trading activities). A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust should consult its tax
advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment
in the notes.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, a U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding at the applicable tax rate with respect
to payments of stated interest or the gross proceeds from dispositions (including a redemption or
retirement) of notes, unless the holder (i) is an entity that is exempt from backup withholding and, when
required, provides appropriate documentation to that effect or (ii) timely provides the applicable
withholding agent with the social security number or other taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), certifies
that the TIN provided is correct and that the holder has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to
backup withholding due to underreporting of interest or dividends, and otherwise complies with applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. In addition, such payments to U.S. holders that are not
otherwise exempt from these rules will generally be subject to information reporting requirements. A
U.S. holder who does not provide the applicable withholding agent with the correct TIN may be subject to
penalties imposed by the IRS.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment
to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may
entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. The
applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the IRS the amount of any “reportable
payments” and any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required by the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations.

**Non-U.S. holders**

_Interest_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of stated interest on a
note to a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided:

  - the interest is not income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business
conducted by the non-U.S. holder (“ECI”);

  - the non-U.S. holder does not actually or constructively (pursuant to the rules of
Section 871(h)(3)(C) of the Code) own 10% or more of stock possessing the total combined
voting power of all classes of our stock that are entitled to vote;

  - the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us actually or constructively
through the stock ownership rules under Section 864(d)(4) of the Code;

  - the non-U.S. holder is not a bank that is receiving the interest on an extension of credit made
pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business; and

  - the non-U.S. holder satisfies the certification requirements set forth in Section 871(h) or 881(c) of
the Code, as applicable, and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder by giving the applicable
withholding agent an appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable
substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe), that has been
properly completed and duly executed establishing its status as a non-U.S. Person or by other
means prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

If these conditions are not met, interest on the notes paid to a non-U.S. holder will generally be
subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate unless (i) an applicable income tax treaty reduces or
eliminates such tax, and the non-U.S. holder claims the benefit of that treaty by providing an appropriate
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other
form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed, or (ii) the interest is
ECI and the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification requirements by providing an


-----

appropriate IRS Form W-8ECI (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS
may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed.

If the interest on the notes is ECI, the non-U.S. holder generally will be required to pay U.S. federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (and the U.S. federal withholding tax described above
will not apply, provided the appropriate statement is provided to the applicable withholding agent) in the
same manner as a U.S. holder. If, however, a non-U.S. holder is eligible for the benefits of any income
tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, any interest income that is ECI will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax (and withholding tax if applicable) in the manner specified by the treaty,
provided that an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form
as the IRS may prescribe) has been properly completed and provided by the non-U.S. holder. In
addition, a corporate non-U.S. holder may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional
“branch profits tax” at a 30% rate, or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate, on its effectively connected
earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, a non-U.S. holder generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain (other than any amount allocable to
accrued and unpaid interest, which would be treated as interest and subject to the rules discussed above
in “—Interest”) recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
notes unless:

  - the gain is ECI (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United
States permanent establishment); or

  - in the case of a non-U.S. holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in
the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year and certain other requirements are
met.

If a non-U.S. holder falls under the first of these exceptions, the holder will be taxed on the net gain
recognized on the disposition under the graduated U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to
U.S. Persons generally, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If the non-U.S. holder
is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to the branch profits tax described above under “—
_Interest,” unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise._

If an individual non-U.S. holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30%, unless reduced by treaty, on the amount by which
the gain derived from the disposition from sources within the United States exceeds certain capital losses
allocable to sources within the United States for the taxable year of the sale.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to non-U.S. holders the amount of interest paid to
non-U.S. holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the
information returns reporting such interest and withholding (if any) may also be made available to the tax
authorities in the country in which a non-U.S. holder resides or is organized under the provisions of an
applicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding with
respect to payments of interest on the notes, provided that the holder certifies its status as a nonU.S. holder under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.

The payment of the proceeds of the disposition of notes (including a retirement or redemption) to or
through the United States office of a United States or foreign broker will be subject to information
reporting and backup withholding unless the non-U.S. holder provides the certification described above or
otherwise establishes an exemption. The proceeds of a disposition effected outside the United States by
a holder of the notes to or through a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup
withholding or information reporting. However, if that broker is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
U.S. Person, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from
all sources for certain periods is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, or a
foreign partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or that has


-----

one or more partners that are U.S. Persons who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or
capital interests in the partnership, information reporting requirements will apply unless such holder
otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld
from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against such
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided it timely furnishes the
required information to the IRS. The applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the IRS
the amount of any “reportable payments” and any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required
by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and
applicable administrative guidance (collectively, “FATCA”), a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will
generally apply to payments of interest on the notes made to (i) a foreign financial institution (whether
such foreign financial institution is a beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such institution
undertakes either under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury or an intergovernmental
agreement between the jurisdiction in which it is a resident and the U.S. Department of Treasury to
generally identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons and foreign entities with substantial U.S. owners,
annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30% on payments made to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders or such institution qualifies for an
exemption from these rules or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity (whether such non-financial foreign entity
is a beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such entity provides the paying agent with a certification
that it does not have any substantial United States owners or a certification identifying the direct and
indirect substantial United States owners of the entity and meets certain other specified requirements or
such entity qualifies for an exemption under these rules.

While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of the notes (including retirement or redemption) on or after January 1, 2019,
proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds
entirely. Although these recent Treasury regulations are not final, the preamble to these Treasury
regulations indicates that taxpayers may rely on them pending their finalization.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA to the
notes.

**The U.S. federal income tax discussion set forth above as to both U.S. holders and non-**
**U.S. holders is included for general information only and may not be applicable depending upon a**
**holder’s particular situation. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the**
**U.S. federal tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes,**
**as well as the tax consequences under state, local, foreign and other tax laws and the possible**
**effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.**
