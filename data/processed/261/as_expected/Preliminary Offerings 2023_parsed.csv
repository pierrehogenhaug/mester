All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this offering memorandum including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, risks and uncertainties related to our business, strategy, capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements. Words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk,” and similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. In addition any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in this offering memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results include: - challenging macroeconomic circumstances in the hotel industry or an economic downturn in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom; - the effects of a prolonged economic downturn or period of weaker trading being exacerbated by our predominantly leasehold operating structure; - exposure of our operations to risks such as terrorism, political instability, events of military action, natural disasters, contagious diseases, pandemics, epidemics or acts of God; - seasonal fluctuations in customer demand; - operating in a highly competitive industry; - failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brand; - our ability to respond to changes in consumer tastes, preferences and perceptions; - timing, budgeting and other risks that could delay our efforts to renovate our properties; - labor shortages or increased labor costs; - failure of our IT systems; - failure to comply with data protection legislation; - increase in the percentage of bookings through intermediaries, such as OTAs and increase in costs of such intermediaries; - failure to comply with regulatory requirements; ----- - failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; - the consequences of a major safety incident; - changes in laws governing our relationship with hotel employees; - challenges to our tax position or changes in tax laws; - inability to extend our leases; - increases of costs under our leases; - risk of disputes with our landlords; - risks of operating individual hotels at a loss and in exiting underperforming leases, management agreements and disposing of selected assets; - changes in tax laws and tax rates or challenges to our tax position; - risks related to having a number of hotels in our development pipeline which have not yet proven their commercial viability; - unsuccessful efforts to develop, acquire or invest in properties or enter into alliances and partnerships with third parties, or carry out developments in new markets; - our dependence on senior executives and key employees; - our dependence on relationships with our third-party suppliers and outsourcing partners; - insufficient insurance coverage; - our exposure to adverse litigation judgments or settlements; - difficulties with our franchise business; - changes to accounting standards; - risks in connection with the use of search engines and search engine marketing; - failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property; and - other risks associated with the Notes and our structure as discussed under “Risk Factors.” We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations.” Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors_ that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.1,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial Information Included in this Offering Memorandum,5.1.1,,"We present in this offering memorandum financial information of the Group. We have included in this offering memorandum: - audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable to the Group reporting under those standards as of December 31, 2020; - audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable to the Group reporting under those standards as of December 31, 2021; and - audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable to the Group reporting under those standards as of December 31, 2022 (collectively, the “Financial Statements”). Although there was a change in accounting framework between the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, there was no impact on recognition, measurement or disclosure in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of a change in framework. The standalone financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for the periods set forth above have not been included in this offering memorandum. Further, the independent auditors’ reports included in this offering memorandum refer to the standalone financial statements of the Parent Guarantor, which have not been included in this offering memorandum. The Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of a calendar year from January 1 to December 31. For management reporting purposes we use a 5-4-4 week accounting calendar. This accounting method divides our fiscal year into four quarters, each comprising two periods of four weeks and one period of five weeks. We have adopted this accounting method because it allows us to manage our business on the basis of 52 weekly periods which consistently end on the same weekday. In order to align this method with our statutory annual accounting period, we make certain adjustments to our results in the last period of each fiscal quarter, in accordance with IFRS. We do not separately present the consolidated financial information of the Issuer because the Issuer has been formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the financing to the Group. As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not conduct any operating activities, hold any assets, other than receivables under the Proceeds Loans (as defined herein), or have any material liabilities, other than the Notes and the Senior Facilities. Except as described below, we do not present in this offering memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis _of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments.”_ The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. ----- Certain financial information in this offering memorandum has been rounded and, as a result, the figures shown as totals in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.2,Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Information,5.2.1,,"Certain financial information, measures and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum, including non-IFRS financial information, financial information presented on a non-IFRS basis, EBITDA (adjusted), EBITDAR (adjusted), EBITDA (adjusted) Margin, EBITDAR (adjusted) Margin and Rent Cover, Free Cash Flow and working capital movement (the “Non-IFRS Measures”) are prepared on a non-IFRS basis and not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. The calculation for the Non-IFRS Measures is consistent across periods presented in this offering memorandum. The most directly comparable IFRS measure to EBITDA (adjusted) and EBITDAR (adjusted) is profit/(loss) for the relevant period. Our Non-IFRS Measures are defined by us as follows: - “EBITDA (adjusted)” represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and before rent phasing adjustment and non-underlying items and an adjustment to reflect accounting principles prior to our adoption of IFRS 16. For a description of non-underlying items and a reconciliation of EBITDA (adjusted) to profit/(loss) for the relevant period, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary Consolidated Historical and Other Financial Data.” - “EBITDAR (adjusted)” represents EBITDA (adjusted) before net external rent payable (before IFRS 16). For a reconciliation of EBITDA (adjusted) to EBITDAR (adjusted), see footnote 2 under “Summary—Summary Consolidated Historical and Other Financial Data”; - “EBITDA (adjusted) Margin” represents EBITDA (adjusted) divided by revenue; - “EBITDAR (adjusted) Margin” represents EBITDAR (adjusted) divided by revenue; - “Free Cash Flow” represents net cash flows from operating activities (before IFRS 16) minus capital expenditure; - “working capital movement” is stated before non-underlying movements, before giving effect to a rent phasing adjustment and before IFRS 16. - “Rent Cover” represents the ratio of EBITDAR (adjusted) to net external rent payable; - “before IFRS 16” represents what our results would have been under accounting principles prior to our adoption of IFRS 16; - “like-for-like,” with respect to RevPAR, compares the RevPAR in two or more periods on the basis of RevPAR generated by hotels that have been open for two years; - “net external rent payable” represents the net of rent receivable and rent payable (before IFRS 16) before the rent phasing adjustment. External rent payable (before IFRS 16) before the rent phasing adjustment reflects the rental amounts accrued adjusted for rent free periods by spreading such amounts over the period to the next rent review date (usually around five years) and recognizes the rent agreed during the CVA (for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021) in line with the actual rent paid; and - “rent phasing adjustment” represents the adjustment of the rent element of our EBITDA (adjusted) calculation, so that the benefit of rent free periods and the CVA rent reductions are spread over the full life of the lease. In many of our leases we receive a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term. According to the straight lining of leases principle under IFRS prior to the application of IFRS 16, the benefit of this rent-free period is recognized gradually ----- over the life of the lease in our income statement as a deduction to the actual rent expense for each year, on a straight-line basis, over the life of each lease, with the unrecognized balance being held as an accrual on our balance sheet. Similarly, any credit relating to the rent reductions resulting from our CVA in 2020 is also recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of each lease. As a result, our total rent expense under IFRS prior to the application of IFRS 16 does not reflect our cash payments of rent in any year. EBITDA (adjusted) for each year recognizes the portion of the rent-free credit attributable to that year as if such credit were applied on a straight line basis until the next rent review, normally five years, and recognizes the reductions resulting from the CVA in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each year. We believe the Non-IFRS Measures are useful metrics for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt and because they permit investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures internally to track our business performance, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) facilitates operating performance comparisons between periods and among other companies in industries similar to ours because it removes the effect of variation in capital structures, taxation, and non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, which may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items. We believe EBITDAR (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it reflects our earnings prior to rent expense and excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items. The Non-IFRS Measures or comparable measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many of which present EBITDA-related performance measures when reporting their results. EBITDA (adjusted) as presented in this offering memorandum differs from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” that will be contained in the Indenture. The Non-IFRS Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are: - not all of them reflect our cash expenditures and they do not reflect our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; ----- - some of the non-underlying items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"Founded in 1985, Travelodge is the second largest hotel brand in the United Kingdom based on number of hotels and number of rooms operated. We leased, franchised, managed and owned 595 hotels and approximately 46,000 rooms throughout the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland as of December 31, 2022. We operate in the midscale and economy (“MS&E”) segment of the hotel market (as defined by STR) and are positioned as a budget operator, offering standardized, modern guest rooms at affordable prices to both business and leisure customers. Our purpose is to provide affordable travel for everyone and we aim to offer our customers the right balance of location, price and quality for their travel needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had brand recognition of 98% among the UK population (as measured by a YouGov brand tracking survey), driven by our long-standing market presence, wide geographic network and effective marketing initiatives. We operate multiple room formats across our hotels, namely our core standard rooms (43,442 in 595 hotels as of December 31, 2022), which include twin, family and accessible rooms, and our “premium economy” SuperRooms (2,319 in 64 hotels across the United Kingdom and Ireland as of December 31, 2022). We estimate that we attracted approximately 21 million customers in 2022, well exceeding our previous pre-COVID-19 pandemic peak of approximately 19 million customers in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. We operate a lean, low-cost operating model, with a relatively small support office and a high proportion of hourly paid team members in hotels. We employ approximately 12,000 people across our hotels and support offices, the majority of whom work in our hotels on hourly paid contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 45,761 rooms in 595 hotels under the Travelodge brand. Within our largest market, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), representing 98% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 43,914 rooms (or 96% of total rooms) in 579 hotels, with 9,888 rooms (or 23% of UK rooms) in 79 hotels located in London and 34,026 rooms (or 77% of UK rooms) in 500 hotels located in regional areas across the United Kingdom. The majority of our hotels in the United Kingdom are leasehold. We also operate one hotel under a freehold and 10 hotels under management contracts in the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, 1,226 rooms in 11 hotels were operated under franchise in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including a new central Dublin City Center hotel opened in 2022, and we operated 621 rooms in five hotels under leasehold in Spain. In early 2023, we opened our first new Spanish hotel in over ten years in Madrid. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR of £909.9 million, £212.9 million and £52.59, respectively, compared to £727.9 million, £129.1 million and £42.46 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2022, our revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR grew at a CAGR of 7.7%, 18.2% and 7.4%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had Occupancy and an Average Room Rate of 81.8% and £64.31, respectively, compared to 80.8% and £52.51 for the year ended December 31, 2019. ----- 93% of our UK revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was generated from accommodation, with the remainder from food and beverage and retail and other sales, including Wi-Fi, car parking and other guest services. The following map indicates the number of rooms that we operated by region as of December 31, 2022: The United Kingdom has one of the largest and most resilient hotel markets in the world, with the segment having already significantly recovered from COVID-19, and RevPAR growing at a CAGR of 4.4% over the last ten years (according to STR data, compared to 1.6% for real UK GDP (Source: International Monetary Fund (“IMF”)). Historically, the performance of the UK hotel industry has been closely correlated to the strength of the UK economy and of the local regions where hotels are situated. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted hotel operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR, we believe that this will normalize in the future. Starting in 2021, the broader economy started to reopen and the breakout of the COVID-19 variant Omicron was contained by the successful rollout of the vaccine booster program. The dissipation of COVID-19 and related restrictions combined with the return of regular international travel were, according to Euromonitor, the driving forces behind the recovery of the lodging market in 2022. The hotel sector was well positioned to capture the post-COVID-19 rebound, benefiting from consumers’ pent-up demand for experiences and travel once the domestic economy re-opened. In particular, the MS&E segment has proven to be highly resilient throughout economic cycles, achieving a significant recovery from COVID-19, with revenues increasing 19.5% from 2019 to 2022. The MS&E segment is outperforming in the UK, with RevPAR growth above the total hospitality sector. Moreover, a recent consumer sentiment survey conducted by PwC in September 2022 showed that an increasing number of UK consumers expected to stay in less expensive accommodations, a development which could be positive for the MS&E segment. As such, we believe there are opportunities to grow the MS&E segment’s share of the UK market and, with a promising secured pipeline, we expect to maintain a regular program of new room openings. The UK hotel market remains relatively fragmented with a variety of local and international hotel operators and independents. We believe the fragmentation of the market presents opportunities for us to grow due to our strong brand recognition and scale. We benefit from high levels of customer satisfaction which we attribute to the quality of our offering and standardized work practices. We have made significant investments to strengthen the quality of our offering. We launched our “premium economy” room type, SuperRooms, which offers an enhanced specification, including a coffee machine, rain shower, choice of pillow and in-room hairdryer, iron and ----- ironing board. In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of non-capital intensive enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés based on market feedback from extensive customer research. The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair and an upgraded bathroom. Our new design also delivers a new style bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work. In 2022, we upgraded 64 hotels and over 6,000 rooms (approximately 14% of the room estate) with our new design, with positive commercial and customer feedback, and we plan to upgrade over 4,000 rooms (approximately 10% of the room estate) in 2023. We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle. The investments in our estate are supported by a standardized and disciplined approach to operations, a lean operating model and efficient cost control, all of which drive profitability. We operate our hotels with a standardized room cleaning process, we have processes in place to monitor our customers’ experience, we provide in-person and online training modules for our employees and we rigorously benchmark our performance by using internal customer surveys and external benchmarking, such as TripAdvisor surveys. In addition, we continue to optimize our operating model by introducing technology to simplify, standardize and automate, including our investments in robot vacuums across our estate, which has helped to reduce the physical demands of the job for our employees, reduce our energy consumption and deliver cost efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Compelling long-term growth fundamentals in the resilient and underpenetrated budget hospitality market,"The United Kingdom has one of the world’s largest and most resilient hotel markets in the world with attractive characteristics. The UK hotel industry generated approximately £20 billion in room revenue in 2022, with approximately 16,392 hotels and 679,215 hotel rooms, according to STR data. Hotel travel by domestic guests has historically benefitted from strong business investment, employment levels, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence in the UK. The UK hotel industry also benefits from a large number of travelers coming to the United Kingdom from other countries, for business travel and tourism, including for large events. Historically, the performance of the UK hotel industry has correlated with the strength of the UK economy generally, being closely related to GDP. Although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR, we believe that this will normalize in the future. Nevertheless, the UK Hotel industry has been able to achieve substantial growth rates: as of December 2022, UK hotel room revenues have increased at a CAGR of 4.4% over the last ten years as compared to 1.6% for real UK GDP. ----- The chart below shows the long-term relationship between the change in real GDP growth and UK hotel RevPAR: _ Source: PwC Research November 2022 (UK Hotels Forecast 2022-2023)._ We are one of the two largest hotel brands in the UK MS&E segment, as defined by STR. Such segment has proven to be highly resilient throughout economic cycles, as in times of economic downturn, cost conscious businesses and leisure customers typically trade down and MS&E hotels are able to outperform the market average, which is particularly relevant in the current inflationary environment. RevPAR for the MS&E segment has recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic. RevPAR for the MS&E segment in 2022 was 18% above RevPAR for the UK hotel market, which had only reached 2019 levels. Our UK like-for-like RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 10.9% ahead of the MS&E segment partly due to strong leisure demand and a rapid recovery in “blue collar” demand, with a more gradual recovery in “white collar” demand. While the current macro-economic environment creates uncertainty, the budget hotel segment has proven resilient, performing well during challenging economic periods relative to other segments and we expect the segment to benefit from a number of positive demand drivers, including continued staycation demand, consumers trading down to budget hotels, changes in working patterns, events and indirectly from inbound tourism as a result of the weak Pound. We believe that the MS&E segment is more resilient during times of economic hardship than other segments, in part, because cost conscious business and leisure customers trade down during those periods. Our revenue and RevPAR increased at a CAGR of 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively, between the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2022, while our EBITDA (adjusted) increased from £129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to £212.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Alongside like-for-like RevPAR growth potential, we also believe there is further opportunity to increase the penetration of branded budget hotels in the United Kingdom. The MS&E segment of the UK hotel market accounted for approximately 37% of total hotel rooms compared to 60% in France (based on data produced by STR). As a result, we believe there are significant opportunities to grow the budget sector and the share of branded budget rooms in the United Kingdom. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Leading market position driven by outstanding brand recognition and well invested network of hotels with proven and sustained market outperformance throughout economic cycles,"We have a strong position in the UK hotel market. We were the first budget hotel brand to launch in the United Kingdom and we had brand recognition of more than 98% among the UK population as of December 31, 2022, as measured by a YouGov brand tracking survey. Our modern hotels and standardized operational processes have allowed us to deliver high levels of customer satisfaction. As of December 31, 2022, our UK hotels had an average TripAdvisor score of four dots out of five, we received 287 TripAdvisor Traveler’s Choice Awards and 89% of our UK hotels were rated four dots or higher on Trip Advisor (from 88% in 2020 and growing or remaining stable every year since). This combination of customer satisfaction and operational discipline, has helped our UK like-for-like RevPAR growth to outperform the MS&E segment since 2015. We also have significant scale in the United Kingdom. We are the second largest hotel brand in the United Kingdom based on number of hotels and number of rooms operated, with 595 hotels and 45,761 rooms as of December 31, 2022 (of which 579 hotels and 43,914 rooms specifically in the UK). Our network is highly diversified with a strong presence throughout the UK, including a large footprint in London (9,888 rooms (or 23% of UK rooms) in 79 hotels as of December 31, 2022) and the rest of our hotels spread throughout other regional areas in the United Kingdom (34,026 rooms (or 77% of UK rooms) in 500 hotels as of December 31, 2022).",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,Compelling guest proposition with attractive customer profile and advantageous business leisure mix,"We have a well invested estate, including six (including London Docklands Central, which replaced an existing hotel, and the Irish franchise in Dublin City Center) that have been newly opened since the beginning of 2022. Our rooms are designed with simplicity and cleanliness in mind, with upgraded facilities contributing to a positive customer experience. In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of non-capital intensive enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés based on market feedback from extensive customer research. The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair and an upgraded bathroom, and a new style format bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work.

We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an expected seven year cycle, with interim works in selected hotels with heavier usage patterns. We have a multi-faceted customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2022, demand and customers spread across many unrelated sectors such as leisure, blue collar and white collar, and we estimate that approximately half our customers were business guests and half were leisure guests, with blue collar customers and white collar customers accounting for approximately 30% and 20%, respectively, of our UK customer base. We have offered business memberships to our business customers since 2016. In 2022, we had over 36,000 business membership sign-ups representing a 9% increase compared to 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Highly effective revenue management system with best in class direct distribution model and customer acquisition,"We use our direct distribution platform to sell rooms directly to our customers without an intermediary. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. Our leading direct distribution platform consistently delivers approximately 80% Occupancy across our hotels. We believe that large numbers of customers book directly with us due to our large-scale brand recognition, presence and simple, user-friendly website that is optimized for mobile use. We believe that our predominantly direct distribution platform gives ----- us greater access to our customers and more control over the booking process, while reducing our overall direct marketing and commission costs. Our pricing is centrally managed by a dedicated team, which uses an optimized revenue management system. We completed a major revenue management system upgrade in 2019, which in conjunction with investments in our data and analytics capability, has enhanced our strong performance after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenue management system uses all available information to forecast demand for each hotel and to optimize prices. Our rates are updated three times per day as internal and external factors change. We have a dedicated events team to monitor key events, such as large attendance concerts, sports events and cultural events, to set and adjust event specific pricing based on forecast demand. Our centralized team uses high-quality reporting, benchmarking and data analytics to monitor performance and adjust pricing in real time to further optimize the prices charged.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,"Lean operating model, including significant proportion of CPI capped rent reviews, driving profitability and cash flows. Strong development pipeline with low upfront capex needs","We operate a lean, low-cost operating model, with a relatively small support office and a high proportion of hourly paid team members in hotels. In the United Kingdom, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, 36% of our operating costs were spent on hotel wages, 18% were spent on other property expenses, 10% were spent on cost of goods sold, including laundry and food and beverages, 10% on our central headquarters, 5% on marketing, 5% on maintenance, 3% on commissions and 13% on other costs) in the year ended December 31, 2022. We have implemented a range of measures to maintain the quality of our offering and reduce our costs. These measures include using predictive models to forecast occupancy at our hotels and align our employee rotas accordingly, optimizing internal processes to reduce the time it takes to complete certain tasks, training our housekeeping teams in multiple skill-sets to increase productivity and reduce personnel costs, and using a dedicated internal maintenance team to carry out routine maintenance. In addition, we have implemented new policies and technology to lower personnel costs, such as shorter hours with dedicated reception support. We also introduced robot vacuums across the estate, helping to reduce the physical demands of the job for our team members, reducing our energy consumption and delivering cost efficiencies. We have also continued to invest in automation of tasks with our Perfect Stay mobile application and energy efficiency measures in our hotels. In 2021, we brought a significant proportion of the remaining outsourced maintenance activity in-house, driving increased efficiency. We continue to selectively use outsourced services where greater service levels or opportunities to reduce costs are available, including certain complex maintenance work, certain aspects of information technology management and telephone bookings and support. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 568, or 95%, of our hotels under leases and we owned one of our hotels. The rest of our hotels are operated under management or franchise agreements. We lease almost all of our hotels through long-term arrangements with landlords, which allows us to expand our portfolio with low upfront capital expenditure, as the vast majority of the upfront construction costs of each hotel are funded by the freehold owner or developer. Development costs, which are incurred by our landlords, vary according to location and building configuration, but typically range between £80,000 and £90,000 per room excluding land (excluding certain locations such as London, where such costs are higher). New leases are normally 25 years, although properties in city centers and London are occasionally operated on terms of 35 years or longer. Most of our leases are subject to standard fiveyearly upwards-only rent reviews (some of which have upper and lower limits (“caps and collars”) on the amount the rent can increase at each review date), and are indexed against RPI or CPI, which allows for relative predictability of rental expenses. In January 2023, we completed a lease re-gear for 97 of our hotels (the “LXI Re-gear”). As part of the LXI Re-gear, rent reviews moved to a CPI + 0.5% per annum basis with caps and collars (4% per annum and 1% per annum, respectively) replacing the previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews. We expect to re-gear leases for an additional 25 hotels, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, in the second quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into agreements to lease more than 22 new hotels with more than 2,100 rooms (our “secured pipeline”) and we expect to open eight hotels and approximately 600 rooms in 2023. In ----- the next few years, we plan to return to our normal hotel opening rate of 15 to 20 each year as market conditions improve. The overall UK rent cover for leases has increased from 0.88x in 2020 to 2.32x in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the rent cover profile (excluding central cost recharges (other than for maintenance costs) and before onerous provision releases) of our 560 UK hotels run under leases and open for at least twelve months was as follows: five hotels had rent cover of less than 1.0x (including two hotels in the Aberdeen market), 34 hotels had rent cover of 1.0x to 1.5x, 100 hotels had rent cover of 1.5x to 2.0x and 421 hotels had rent cover of more than 2.0x. The majority of our leases also have favorable extension rights and the average remaining term on our UK leases, excluding renewal rights and after giving effect to the LXI Re-gear that was completed in January 2023, was approximately 18 years as of December 31, 2022. The rent reviews for the leases across our estate are staggered over a five-year period to help smooth dramatic inflation increases. As a result of our tight cost control and low upfront capital expenditures on our leasehold properties, we had an EBITDA (adjusted) Margin of 23.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022, notwithstanding subdued UK hotel market growth and significant cost increases associated with wage cost growth that exceeded inflation. Our EBITDAR (adjusted) margins have also increased from 46.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 49.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.6,Comprehensive sustainability plan integrated into wider strategy,"We place a strong emphasis on safety and security, the environment, and our social responsibilities. Following extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, we developed a comprehensive “Better Future” sustainability plan, which was launched in 2022. The plan will help us to improve focus and performance, and to share that progress transparently with our stakeholders. We firmly believe that sustainability has a critically important role to play in shaping the future of our business. For that reason, our Better Future sustainability plan is closely aligned with our mission, to provide affordable travel for everyone and integrated with our wider business strategy. Our Better Future plan is predicated on valuing our colleagues, customers and planet, and is underpinned by three pillars: (1) _Inclusive_ _— ensuring Travelodge is accessible, inclusive, and affordable to its colleagues and customers; (2) Caring _— creating a safe and healthy environment for our colleagues and customers, and ensuring their_ wellbeing; and (3) Conscious _— being conscious of the waste we produce, the energy and resources we consume, and our carbon emissions. In line with our Better Future plan, we implemented a number of energy reduction projects in 2022. To date, we have already generated an estimated annual reduction of 24 GWh through the installation of LED lighting in most of our hotels. We also installed smart heating and cooling controls at 133 of our hotels, bringing the total across the estate to 260 hotels. These controls reduce our heating electricity consumption by approximately 45% on average per hotel. Given new technology is also important to delivering our wider business plan, we now have air to water heat pump systems installed in five new hotels and plan to replace existing electric immersion hot water systems with air to water heat pump systems in two of our existing hotels in Carlisle and Ilford in 2023. This will enable us to test and understand the challenges of retrofitting these at existing hotels and to potentially implement a wider plan of replacements of other electric immersion hot water systems within our existing estate starting in 2024. Our goal is to become a net-zero business by 2050, including measuring and reducing our indirect scope 3 emissions. As part of our Better Future plan, we intend to become a net zero operator by 2050 for our direct emissions. We plan to achieve this through a general reduction of net energy consumption by leveraging technology such as efficient LED lighting in both common areas and guestrooms, smart heating and cooling controls, solar panels and replacing old, inefficient, electrically powered boilers for hot water, with new technology such as air to water heat pumps in conjunction with the decarbonization of the national grid set in UK law. We also plan to remove our need to use gas to heat water, and substitute this with other energy producing technologies. ----- For additional information on our key performance indicators relating to these principles, see “Business—Sustainability and ESG.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.7,Experienced management team with solid track record of delivering operational and financial improvements,"We have a strong and experienced management team, with our Chairman and Chief Executive each having extensive experience in the hospitality and other sectors. On March 16, 2023, we announced the appointment of Aidan Connolly as Chief Financial Officer, and he started in this role on April 3, 2023. Mr. Connolly previously held executive positions at My Travel, Sodexo, Worldpay, Wilko and Alter Domus. Our senior management team benefits from a wide range of experience, including prior senior roles in the airline, retail and property industries. We have strong functional teams in sales and marketing, revenue management, property, IT and operations that are led by management members who have significant experience from working with major hospitality and other brands in the United Kingdom and other countries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.8,Clear and significant opportunities for further growth,"We have identified near-term and highly actionable opportunities to unlock growth and improve the performance of our existing estate. We have begun to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle, which we believe will enhance revenue performance and customer satisfaction. We believe we can grow our food and beverage offering by continuing to optimize our bar café performance through better aligning our offering with customer demand and by redesigning and simplifying our menu. As of December 31, 2022, we derived 36% of our food and beverage revenue from our bar café hotels. We have not advertised on television since the previous campaign ended in May 2016. We believe there is a strong strategic basis for brand building media investment to drive consideration of our brand, which will support our long-term RevPAR growth. We plan to continue to invest in numerous energy efficiency initiatives that provide long-term cost savings and support our goal to becoming a net-zero business. For example, in 2022, we installed smart temperature controls in 133 hotels and continued to benefit from the installation of smart temperature controls in 44 hotels installed in 2021. In addition, we have installed efficient LED lighting in most common areas and LED lighting is being installed in guestrooms. Under our low capital expenditure development model, when prospective hotel sites are identified, we work with the land owner and developers to agree a proposal and sign an agreement for lease. The developer then builds the hotel to our specifications and incurs the full costs of construction. Once the project is complete, we confirm that our requirements have been met. Subsequently, the developer typically sells the hotel building to a high quality institutional investor or private investor. We then begin operations and pay rent. We are typically responsible for all ongoing maintenance capital expenditure, which is primarily comprised of stamp duty and legal fees. We believe we can continue to use this model to grow our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.1,Location: Extend Our Hotel Network and Strengthen Our Portfolio,"As of December 31, 2022, we operated 45,761 rooms in 595 hotels under the Travelodge brand across the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. We aim to open hotels across the United Kingdom, Spain and potentially in other countries with sustainable low-cost demand. These locations include city centers, large towns and suburban markets, year-round leisure destinations, business parks and critical transport hubs. In the next few years, we plan to return to our normal hotel opening rate of 15 to 20 each year as market conditions improve. As of December 31, 2022, we had a secured pipeline of more than 22 new ----- hotels and more than 2,100 rooms. We expect to open eight hotels and approximately 600 rooms in 2023, and we intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our hotel portfolio beyond our secured pipeline. We have the option to expand our operations in Ireland under our master franchise agreement. In addition, we believe expansion opportunities exist in Spain under our existing development model. In the UK, we have an in-house development team, supported by external third parties, that works with local developers and landlords to identify potential opportunities for new hotels. In addition, we use independent third-party hotel consultants to identify future potential locations suitable for our hotels in the UK and Spain. As part of our expansion strategy, we are targeting another 300 potential hotel locations across the UK that would be suitable for a Travelodge hotels. Based on our track record of new openings to date, we are confident that we can continue our expansion in the UK and internationally. Furthermore, while we don’t currently utilize a freehold model, we believe that a freehold model could present opportunities for growth as a largely untapped strategy, with the total capital requirement limited by the potential use of sale and leaseback transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.2,Price: Offer Attractive Prices Supported by Predictive Data and Low-Cost Operations,"We aim to offer attractive prices using what we believe is a best in class yield management system and applying predictive analytics tools. Our price setting system uses data analysis to forecast demand, set pricing levels and monitor our rate of sale and our competitors’ pricing. Using exception reporting, our revenue team then adjusts the price points for each hotel individually where appropriate to optimize RevPAR, based on demand and competition. Our rates are updated three times per day and vary depending on hotel, room type, rate type, and stay date. We adjust our pricing to improve our RevPAR by aiming to strike the optimal balance between rate and occupancy. In the year ended December 31, 2022, over 84% of our bookings were made online through our websites. Digital sales channels are important to the growth of our business and we have already made significant changes to strengthen our presence, increasing website conversion and digital customer acquisition effectiveness.

In early 2022, we launched a new design, transforming the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés. We aim to continue our drive to improve the consistency of our customers’ experience. Our central operations team uses regular guest feedback to identify priority areas for operational change and we develop standardized processes for key areas within the hotel that directly affect the customer experience, such as room cleaning and breakfast service. We have also deployed a standard training program for our employees at each of our hotels which focuses on customer service and problem resolution, and we offer additional management development training for hotel managers. We have also continued to invest in automation tasks with our Perfect Stay mobile application, which we upgraded in 2020, and energy efficiency measures in our hotels. In 2021, we brought a significant proportion of the remaining out-sourced maintenance activity in-house, driving increased efficiency. We continue to selectively outsource certain functions and services where greater service levels or opportunities to reduce costs are available, including certain complex maintenance work, certain aspects of information technology management and telephone bookings and support. We have implemented significant improvements to our online platform to enhance the booking experience for our business customers. These include our Travelodge Business and Travelodge ----- Business Pay products designed with small and medium enterprises in mind but which also offer noteworthy efficiencies and benefits for larger companies. These products include a dedicated website for businesses, detailed reporting functionality to enable customers to manage their bookings and travel spend with greater ease, as well as a simplified and improved booking journey which also offers a discount on our most flexible rates. Additionally, we have partnered with a third-party provider to offer Travelodge Business Pay, an interest-free credit facility for our business customers.

In 2023, our revenue and like-for-like RevPAR were positively impacted by strong leisure demand, including public events, continued strong “blue collar” demand and improving “white collar” demand, with corporate mid-week central London demand recovering but partly offset by national rail strikes. In addition, the first quarter of 2022 was heavily impacted by Omicron restrictions. London hotel performance was significantly ahead of 2022, reflecting the slower recovery experienced in 2022. Regional hotel performance was ahead of 2022, with strong leisure and “blue collar” demand. Forward bookings were positive but with limited visibility. Based on the STR Total Room Inventory methodology currently in place, we performed in line with the MS&E segment compared to 2022 due to strong first quarter 2022 comparables in London and the refit of two of our large central London hotels. Our 2023 performance was 40% ahead of 2019 levels and we outperformed the MS&E segment compared to 2019.

EBITDA (adjusted) is not defined by IFRS. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful metric for investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use this measure internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, as well as evaluating our underlying historical performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) facilitates operating performance comparisons between periods and among other companies in industries similar to ours because it removes the effect of variation in capital structures, taxation, and non-cash depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, non-underlying items and rent phasing adjustment which may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items.

(b) Non-underlying items represent certain non-recurring items that are not representative of the underlying performance of our business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, non-underlying items included a provision of £13.4 million for a one off rent payment clause in connection with the CVA, a £1.9 million loss on disposal of fixed assets incurred upon exiting the old Docklands hotel lease, with the new Docklands hotel now open and trading, £3.3 million of finance costs incurred in connection with the repayment of our term loan in 2022, £8.4 million of operating expenses, including £3.6 million of costs relating to the departure of our CEO in May 2022 due to ill health, and £4.7 million of professional fees in connection with the design and implementation of a new senior management incentive plan and the share-based payment charge for the year, partially offset by a £0.9 million credit to revenue from the release of expired vouchers issued in relation to cancelled stays during periods of lockdown. For the year ended December 31, 2021, non-underlying items included a £20.3 million profit on disposal of assets where break clauses were instigated as a direct result of the CVA, a £6.9 million revenue credit from the release of expired vouchers issued in relation to cancelled stays during periods of lockdown and a £3.3 million credit from other provision reassessments, partially offset by a £0.3 million charge for the impairment of fixed assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-underlying items included a £31.3 million profit on disposal of assets where break clauses were instigated as a direct result of the CVA and the surrender of a property lease (which was a finance lease under IFRS before the application of IFRS 16), partially offset by £15.0 million of charges from legal and professional fees and management incentives in connection with the initial landlord consensual proposal, subsequent CVA and other corporate activity, a £8.7 million charge for the impairment of fixed assets, other CVA related costs of £0.6 million and a £0.5 million charge relating to the write off of the unamortized fee owed under our revolving credit facility at the time of the repayment of the revolving credit facility. (c) In many of our leases we receive a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term. According to the straight lining of leases principle under IFRS prior to the application of IFRS 16, the benefit of this rent-free period is recognized gradually over the life of the lease in our income statement as a deduction to the actual rent expense for each year, on a straight-line basis, over the life of each lease, with the unrecognized balance being held as an accrual on our balance sheet. Similarly, any credit relating to the rent reductions resulting from our CVA in 2020 is also recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of each lease. As a result, our total rent expense under IFRS prior to the application of IFRS 16 does not reflect our cash payments of rent in any year. EBITDA (adjusted) for each year recognizes the portion of the rent-free credit attributable to that year as if such credit were applied on a straight line basis until the next rent review, normally five years, and recognizes the reductions resulting from the CVA in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each year. The rent phasing adjustment reflects the adjustment of the rent element of our EBITDA (adjusted) calculation, so that the benefit of rent free periods and the CVA rent reductions are spread over the full life of the lease. (d) Since our adoption of IFRS 16, operating lease rent is no longer charged to our profit and loss account. The disapplication of IFRS 16 adjustment is an adjustment to reflect what our results would have been under lease accounting principles prior to our adoption of IFRS 16. We believe that excluding the impact of IFRS 16 on certain financial information is useful for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt separate from our ability to make rent payments on our leases. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Non_IFRS Financial and Operating Information.” (2) EBITDAR (adjusted) represents EBITDA (adjusted) before net external rent payable (before non-underlying items and before IFRS 16). EBITDAR is not defined by IFRS. We believe EBITDAR (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it reflects our earnings prior to rent expense and excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items. For a description of the limitations of EBITDAR (adjusted) as an analytical tool, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Information.” ----- External rent payable (before non-underlying items) reflects the rental amounts due for the year, adjusted to spread the benefit of rent free periods over the period to the next rent review date. The credit attributable to reductions resulting from the CVA was recognized in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each period.

Our summary financial information as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 has been derived from the financial information set forth in our Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This section includes certain financial information, including Non-IFRS Measures, that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS because we believe they provide investors with useful additional information to measure our performance, liquidity or capital expenditures. We believe that excluding the impact of IFRS 16 for certain financial information is useful for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt. We also use these Non-IFRS measures internally to track our business performance, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. You should exercise caution in comparing the Non-IFRS Measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation. See “Presentation of Financial Information.” We have included other operating information in this offering memorandum, some of which we refer to as “key performance indicators,” including RevPAR, Occupancy, Average Room Rate and Rent Cover. We believe that it is useful to include this operating information as we use it for internal performance analysis, and the presentation by our business divisions of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies in our industry, although our measures may not be comparable with similar measurements presented by other companies. Such operating information should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following summary consolidated historical and other financial data is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the sections of this offering memorandum entitled “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Capitalization” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"Challenging macroeconomic circumstances or a further economic downturn in Europe, in particular the United Kingdom, continuing or prolonged cost of living increases or declines or disruptions in business investment and consumer discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.","Most of our hotels are located in the United Kingdom. The hotel market performance in the United Kingdom, and therefore our financial performance, is closely linked to economic growth, with a close correlation between GDP, business investment, our occupancy rates and the rates we charge for our rooms. The strength of the Pound relative to other currencies, particularly the Euro, also impacts performance as it has an influence on the willingness of non-UK customers to visit the United Kingdom and UK customers to travel abroad. We therefore face risks from changes in the major macroeconomic factors influencing domestic GDP and currency strength. The global economy experienced one of its sharpest downturns in history as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the related lockdowns and restrictions on activity. Although some economies experienced a strong rebound in 2021 as restrictions eased, there is a material risk of a global recession coupled with high inflation. Our business operations also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in inflation, global commodity prices, energy prices and other indirect factors such as our supply chain. We enter into flexible energy contracts that allow us to fix electricity and gas prices throughout the term of the contract. We renewed our energy contracts in March 2023 and we entered into hedging agreements for the majority of the year under a purchasing framework. To counter inflation, central banks have started increasing interest rates and they may continue to increase interest rates. Policy tightening in the UK and markets across the world has already begun in order to counteract rising inflation. If our costs continue to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures or interest rate increases, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. The impact of the military conflict in Ukraine has contributed to this and could cause sustained inflationary pressures and general economic uncertainty and it is not possible to predict its duration or future effect on the world economy, the UK economy, the financial markets, our supply chains, our costs or consumer confidence in general. In addition, an extended period of increased commodity prices could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are not able to effectively mitigate such risks, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, consumer demand for our hotels and services is impacted by a number of factors such as personal discretionary spending levels and business and public sector activity. As a result, our revenue is affected by general levels of consumer confidence and disposable income, events, business investment and travel, and public sector demand for temporary accommodation. The largely discretionary nature of spending on hotels makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic developments than businesses offering non-discretionary products or services. Changes to personal consumer spending, including changes driven by the level of inflation, employment, wages, interest rates and competing spending needs, as well as the cost and desirability of international travel, may also impact our performance. The cost of living crisis, driven by the high levels of inflation, has the potential to impact demand and consumer choices. Changes in business and public sector travel and accommodation policies, which may be affected by factors such as general economic growth, the political climate, ----- government policy, currency movements and corporate expense controls, could also impact our performance. While demand may reduce due to the aforementioned factors, such factors may also lead consumers to increasingly trade down to budget hotels. We may also benefit from increasing staycation demand and changing working patterns, which may result in increased domestic travel within the UK. However, some of our customers may have less disposable income or reduced business spending accounts which may affect the frequency with which they travel. Additionally, some businesses may limit the amount of travel by their employees and reduce the number of events or conferences they host and attend in order to save on costs. An uncertain economic outlook may also adversely affect customer spending on our hotels, as customers spend less in anticipation of a potentially prolonged economic downturn. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions affecting our customers could reduce spending on some or all of our properties, imposing practical limits on our pricing. Furthermore, fewer customers looking for accommodation services may cause our competitors to discount their hotel pricing. See “— _We operate in a highly competitive industry, and failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and market share.”_ As a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it may be difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to the emergence of adverse economic conditions affecting the United Kingdom and Europe could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, factors such as financial and political crises in the eurozone, terrorist attacks or other unexpected events, measures implemented by the UK government to reduce the national deficit through welfare or other budget cuts, changes to household support (for example, a reduction or cessation of the government’s Energy Price Guarantee or Energy Bill Support Scheme), rising interest rates, declining wages, higher unemployment, tax increases and lack of consumer credit could all adversely affect the level of UK consumer confidence and disposable income. Geopolitical tensions, such as trade tensions between the United Kingdom and the European Union, also have the potential to trigger market volatility and negatively affect consumer confidence and global or regional growth. Any of these factors could reduce our revenue and profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to continue to invest. Declines in GDP or consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions or changes in business model, consumer confidence or travel patterns negatively impact the revenues and profitability of our hotels.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,The effects of a prolonged economic downturn or period of weaker trading could be exacerbated by our predominantly leasehold operating structure.,"We operate the vast majority of our hotels on a leasehold basis. Our lease agreements typically provide for a rent review at the end of each five year-period during the term of the lease and this review cycle is broadly spread evenly across our hotels over a five-year period. At a rent review the rent payable by us can only be increased, in most cases based on an inflation linked index, but not decreased. In the event of less favorable trading conditions, our revenues may fall while the costs relating to our leases are likely to remain fixed or continue to rise, particularly if there is a period of inflation affecting our leasehold rent reviews. In January 2023, we completed the LXI Re-gear for 97 of our hotels. As part of the LXI Re-gear, rent reviews moved to a CPI + 0.5% per annum basis with caps and collars (4% per annum and 1% per annum, respectively) replacing the previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews. We expect to re-gear leases for an additional 25 hotels, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, in the second quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 65% of our lease costs are RPI uncapped based on rent roll. Future increases of our leasehold rents could have a material adverse effect on our costs and thereby decrease our profitability and cash flows. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Disruptions to our business operations as a result of political instability or other adverse conditions in the countries in which we operate could negatively affect our profitability, especially if such disruptions take place during peak travel periods. The occurrence and consequences of such events, or the fear or expectation of such events, are unpredictable, and further attacks, political instability or military action could have a material adverse effect on the travel, hospitality and leisure industries in general, negatively impacting the locations in which we operate and our business and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the physical effects of climate change, including sea level rise, droughts, flooding and intensified storms and other weather events. Damage to our hotels, or interference with transportation links resulting from the physical effects of climate change or adverse weather conditions, could lower demand for travel to certain locales and affect the performance of certain of our hotels, which could in turn have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we maintain property and business interruption insurance, we carry deductibles, and there can be no assurance that if a flood or other natural or man-made disaster or other catastrophe should affect our geographical areas of operations, we would be able to maintain our current level of operations or profitability, or that property and business interruption insurance would adequately reimburse us for our losses. Some types of losses, such as from terrorism and acts of war, may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against. An uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, COVID-19 continues to affect certain countries or regions around the world. The continuing effects of COVID-19 or the possibility of other outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics or similar public health crises, or fear of such events, may affect regional or global travel demand or travel behavior. Such events may cause trading or travel restrictions in the UK and the UK economy in general, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,Demand for our hotel rooms and our other products and services are subject to seasonal fluctuations in customer demand.,"Our bookings and occupancy rates are affected by seasonal and cyclical changes in customer demand. This demand varies from property to property, and region to region, depending on the location and category of each hotel. For example, the number of tourist arrivals in the United Kingdom changes significantly depending upon the season, with the first quarter of the year typically a low point for demand and holiday periods seeing reduced business demand. As a result, the level of demand for our hotel rooms and our other products and services fluctuates over the course of the calendar year and, while there are variations among our geographical regions, our revenue and occupancy rates are generally highest in July and September, and lowest in January. However, a significant proportion of our expenses are incurred more evenly throughout the year and as a result, our working capital fluctuates throughout the year. Changes to the seasonal and cyclical customer demand may affect our business planning, resourcing plans and working capital requirement, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We face a variety of competitive challenges in attracting new guests and maintaining customer loyalty among our existing customer base, including: ----- - competitively and consistently pricing our rooms at the appropriate level and achieving customer perception of value; - anticipating and responding to the needs of our customers; - differentiating the quality and perceived value of our hotel services and products with respect to our competitors, including other hotel operators, alternative accommodation providers and online distributors; - developing and maintaining a strong brand image and a reputation for consistent quality and service across our hotels; - finding desirable locations for development; - responding to alternative sources of accommodation providers that operate at lower costs; - undertaking effective and appropriate promotional activities and effectively responding to promotional activities of our competitors; - maintaining and developing effective website designs, mobile applications and online presence; and - attracting and retaining talented employees and management teams. We compete with hotel operators and alternative accommodation providers of varying sizes in the MS&E segment, including major international chains with well-established and recognized brands offering a broad range of accommodation and services, as well as specialist or independent hotel operators. Some of our competitors, such as Premier Inn, have a greater number of hotels and rooms than we do, and other competitors such as Ibis and Holiday Inn Express offer more amenities than we do, albeit generally at a higher price. As a result, these competitors may have greater name and brand recognition, and greater attraction than we do for certain customer segments. Our competitors may also have greater financial resources, higher purchasing economies of scale and lower cost bases than we have. Consequently, they may be able to spend more on marketing and advertising campaigns, thereby increasing market share. Our competitors may be able to react more swiftly to changes in market conditions or trends or to offer lower prices or incur higher costs for longer than we can. Our market share and revenue could be negatively affected by aggressive pricing, intensive promotional activities and discount strategies by our competitors, as well as by actions taken by us to maintain our competitiveness and reputation, and other actions that attract customers away from us. Furthermore, new hotels are likely to be built in the markets in which we operate and this may result in temporary or prolonged pressure on our prices and our occupancy rate. There is a risk that such new supply, particularly if introduced in large volume or in a period of low demand, could have a significant effect on our ability to maintain our trading performance in those markets. Additionally, sharing economy providers compete against traditional accommodation providers such as hostels and hotels and may disrupt or reduce customer demand for traditional accommodation or require traditional accommodation providers to alter their business model or pricing structures in order to be able to compete effectively. If we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We depend on our ability to develop our brand and our image as a leading budget hotel operator across the United Kingdom, and we leverage this reputation in Ireland and Spain, where we have a growing presence. Travelers expect that we will provide a consistent level of quality and value, and therefore, our performance across our markets in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain depends on the strength of our brand and reputation. Online reviews on sites such as TripAdvisor and Google may increasingly affect customers’ choice of hotels. Although we actively monitor our online reviews, negative online reviews could have an adverse impact on our brand image and reputation. Any event that leads to customer complaints or negative publicity or reviews by customers could damage our image, reputation or brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation could also be damaged if customer complaints or negative reviews of us or our activities were to be published on travel sites, such as TripAdvisor, or public social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter. The effect of bad reviews on our brand may be increased by the fact that there are, as far as we are aware, three further operators of the Travelodge name in other parts of the world which are not connected with our Group, and we have no control over the quality and performance of those operators and our brand may be affected by negative publicity related to them. Maintaining a positive reputation is important in attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver on standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the activities of clients and counterparties. Negative publicity about us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. We intend to continue to target certain initiatives, including improvements to our offering and marketing and brand development programs, as part of our plan to develop and promote our brand. Our plans to improve our offering as well as our marketing and brand development programs will be expensive and time-consuming and will require significant attention from management. Our efforts to develop and promote our brand, and improve our customer offering, may not be successful or our results of operations may not improve to the extent anticipated, or the expenditures associated with developing and promoting our brand may increase due to a variety of factors, including increased spending from our competitors and inflation in media pricing, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.7,"Our future performance depends in part on our ability to respond to changes in consumer tastes, preferences and perceptions.","Our financial results are affected by changes in consumer preferences and perceptions. If we fail to continue to offer hotels that appeal to our customers, we may not be able to sustain or increase customer traffic. Furthermore, consumer tastes may change and customers may demand different or higher quality facilities or services in the future. We may not be able to adapt our offerings to account for such changes, or we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or may not have the funds necessary to carry out the implementation of the required changes. In addition, customers could perceive our rooms and furnishings to be out of date or worn, and we may not have the financial or operational capacity to maintain, refresh or refurbish our rooms so that they satisfy customer perceptions of quality and value, or we may not be able to carry out the upgrades required by our customers in a timely manner. Moreover, prevailing preferences and perceptions could cause consumers to avoid our hotels in favor of alternatives. Changes in consumer tastes, preferences and trends may continue to impact our financial results, particularly if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to such changes by evolving our brand in a timely fashion. ----- We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand or ensure that our initiatives will be successful. Even if we are successful in our branding effort, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would negatively affect our ability to compete in the hotel industry and would negatively affect our business. As new media, such as social media and smart phones, continue to develop, we will need to spend more resources to develop new means to promote our brand awareness through such media outlets.

In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of noncapital intensive enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar café based on market feedback from extensive customer research. The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair in which to relax and an upgraded bathroom. Our new design also delivers a new style bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work. We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including: - construction delays or cost overruns, including labor and materials, that may increase project costs; - obtaining planning and other required permits or authorizations; - governmental restrictions on the size or kind of renovation; - requirements for remedial works to address compliance with building regulations; - force majeure events, including storms and floods; and - design defects that could cause delays or increase costs. The timing of capital improvements at existing hotels can affect occupancy rates and room prices, particularly if we need to close a significant number of rooms or other facilities, such as bar cafés. Moreover, the investments that we make may fail to attract customers to our properties in the manner that we expect. If such investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance, our ability to compete effectively may be diminished and our revenue could be reduced. Furthermore, ongoing maintenance or repair work may lead to increased noise levels, which could negatively affect our customers’ experience during their stay with us and lead to negative feedback or publicity, especially through social media, thus affecting our brand image. Additionally, our ability to execute refurbishment programs will depend on our ability to generate cash, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete such refurbishment activities on time, or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash to carry out work necessary to maintain such properties could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these hotels and ultimately may affect the value of these assets. Our failure to complete refurbishment programs to the extent or in the timeframe contemplated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

If our website were to become inoperable for a sustained period, our ability to take hotel room bookings would be significantly impacted. If our price setting system fails to effectively analyze our proprietary pricing structure, or defines suboptimal or incorrect pricing rates, the rates that we charge for our rooms could be too high, which could drive customers away and damage our reputation as a cost-effective budget hotel brand. Alternatively, if the prices which the price setting system sets are too low, our revenue could be lower than it otherwise would have been, leading to a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the system could experience periods of downtime, which could result in our room rates being set manually and lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of our pricing structure. If our property management system were to be out of service for a sustained period, we would incur operational challenges and likely higher costs, including higher payroll to manually assign rooms until the system could be restored. Providing convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to our customers is critical to our business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to our customers or any interruption of those services, or if such services are only available at an increased cost to us or our customers or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, our customers may be deterred from frequenting our hotels. We also depend on information technology to run our day-to-day operations, including hotel services and amenities such as guest check-in and check-out, housekeeping and room service and to track and report financial results of our hotels and the Group. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events.

In the operation of our business, we collect, store, use, and transmit large volumes of personal data regarding customers and our own business operations, including credit card numbers, reservation data, and other personal data, in various information systems that we maintain. The integrity and protection of this personal data is critical to our business. We also rely on the systems of third parties in areas such as bookings, data storage, management and payment of employees and suppliers, credit card processing, telecommunications and wireless networks. Any defects, failures and interruptions in such systems, or changes to such systems requiring us to migrate to different platforms or providers, or modify our own systems and processes, could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. In particular, any interruption to the ability of customers to make online reservations and payments would negatively affect our business and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Lack of resilience and operational availability and/or the failure of a third-party technology provider could lead to prolonged service disruption and may result in significant business interruption, impact the customer experience and subsequently impact on revenues.

In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. Because the interpretation and application of laws and other obligations relating to privacy and data protection are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in ----- a commercially reasonable manner or at all. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

However, currently, we do not derive a significant portion of our business from online travel intermediaries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. As a result, the costs currently associated with our distribution platform are tightly controlled by us, and we can control the way our hotels and product offerings are portrayed to customers. This gives us greater ability to leverage our brand and our customers’ loyalty to the brand. Various booking websites publish user reviews based upon personal testimonies, including photos that have not been vetted or verified. Although we actively monitor online reviews of our hotels, we have little control over the way in which our hotels and our offering of services and products are portrayed through these third-party sites. Our hotels may be categorized on booking websites according to the search criteria deemed appropriate by the online travel intermediaries and may be grouped together with other hotels that are made to look more desirable, for example, due to proximity to tourist sites or based upon user reviews. Some online travel intermediaries may emphasize factors such as price or general indicators of quality (for example, “four-star downtown hotel”) at the expense of brand identification. Such measures are aimed at developing customer loyalty with respect to the reservation system used rather than to our brands. If the share of bookings made through online travel intermediaries, or the commission charged by such intermediaries, increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brand, we may experience a decline in customer loyalty and repeat business and consequently, our business and revenues could be harmed.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

In addition, we may be required to maintain or renew existing licenses or permits, or acquire new licenses or permits (including building permits for new developments), for our business or operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing licenses or permits, or acquire new licenses or permits. Compliance with applicable rules and regulations and related dialogue with regulatory authorities involve significant costs and resources. For example, we receive enforcement notices from time to time from local fire and other regulatory agencies and there is no assurance that these may not result in additional costs to remediate issues or further action against us. The failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to a number of adverse consequences such as fines, bad publicity, and legal fees. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Complying with environmental or other health and safety laws and regulations, or addressing violations arising under them, could increase our environmental costs and liabilities, subject us to fines or penalties, reduce our profits or limit our ability to run our business. For example, following the fire at the Grenfell Tower residential building on June 14, 2017, the UK government has progressively released emerging guidance on tall building fire safety requirements. In line with this emerging guidance, we carried out a comprehensive review of our estate to establish whether there were any further opportunities to strengthen our fire protection measures. The process for this review was developed with our third-party fire safety advisors and with the guidance of our primary fire authority, who granted “assured advice status” to certain aspects of the process. The review has confirmed that our hotels remain safe to operate. However, we believe it is likely that works will be required to ensure ongoing safe operation of our hotels, and/or to comply with future changes in interpretation of regulation or new regulations. There may also be disputes between interested parties as to the responsibility for compliance and works. These works or disputes could result in additional costs or have other negative impacts on our business. Existing environmental laws and regulations continue to be revised and new laws and regulations related to global climate change, sustainable energy, air quality or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us. For example, the UK government’s target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. As a result, we may become subject to additional regulations and restrictions and have to make changes to our hotels or operations, requiring unanticipated or accelerated investments or costs. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Punishment for infringement of the environmental laws might consist of remediating the damaged environment, administrative and criminal penalties and fines. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to operate our hotels. In addition, under environmental laws, we could be made responsible to investigate or clean up soil or water contamination on properties we own or lease, even if the contamination was caused by someone else or historically. Certain of our leases provide that we are not liable for any potential environmental clean-up. However, we could still be subject to liability to a regulator or third parties for the cost of investigating or remediating hazardous substances or waste on, under or in our properties. A person who arranges for hazardous substances or waste to be transported, disposed of or treated offsite, such as at disposal or treatment facilities, also may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation if those substances are released into the environment by third parties at such disposal or treatment facilities, and we may be at such a risk. The presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or waste, or the failure to properly clean up such materials, could cause us to incur significant costs, or jeopardize our ability to develop, use or rent our properties or to borrow using such property as collateral. ----- There can be no assurance that we will at all times be in compliance with the environmental laws applicable to us. Even where we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws we may still be subject to liability. For example, hazardous waste such as petrol could contaminate our sites or asbestos, which we manage in compliance with the applicable regulations and internal policies, may need to be removed at our cost as a result of refurbishments or other works on our site. If this risk were to materialize, governmental authorities may impose certain administrative and criminal penalties or fines for violation of environmental laws and may also, among other things, close, either indefinitely or temporarily, operations of any businesses located at any properties found in violation of any environmental laws. In addition, we may be required to manage, abate or remove materials containing hazardous substances such as mold, lead or asbestos during demolitions, renovations or remodeling at our properties. The costs related to such management, abatement, removal or related permitting could be substantial and any violation of environmental laws or regulations could have material adverse effect on our brand image, reputation, business, results of operation and financial condition. We are aware of asbestos on certain of our sites. We have adopted an asbestos policy and aim to manage each of these cases in close compliance with this policy. In our business, effluent waste is produced and, in certain cases, we are responsible for the pumping station and required to route effluent waste to the mains sewer. When effluent waste breaches it qualifies as hazardous waste. In addition, owners and operators of property, such as us, may face civil liability for personal injury or property damage because of various environmental conditions, such as alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic substances, poor indoor air quality, radon or poor drinking water quality. Future changes in environmental laws or the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our hotels, our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, environmental regulations have become increasingly stringent over the last decade. This trend is likely to continue. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of additional laws and regulation would not have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

For example, in 2016 the UK government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage. We estimate that approximately 87% of our employees are paid hourly. Any increases in the National Living Wage or other regulatory developments which impose additional obligations on us with respect to our employees, such as the requirement to pay employer pension contributions pursuant to the government’s auto-enrolment scheme, could increase our personnel expenses, adversely affecting our profitability and cash flows. Even where such regulations are limited to a distinct subset of our employees, for competitive or other reasons we could be required to implement them for other subsets, which would exacerbate adverse effects. For example, in April 2023, the National Living Wage increased from £9.50 per hour to £10.42 per hour for all workers over 23 years old. We offer the over 23 year old National Living Wage as a minimum to staff of all ages. Further increases of the National Living Wage would further increase our operating costs. In addition, since April 6, 2017, each company in the United ----- Kingdom that spends more than £3 million a year on wages for employees is required to pay an apprenticeship levy of 0.5% on its wages bill in order to fund training for apprenticeships in the United Kingdom. The foregoing requirements and regulations and proposed or future changes thereto could lead to higher wage costs, changes in work rules, legal costs and limitations on our ability to take cost saving measures during economic downturns, all of which may increase our operating costs. Failure to comply with these requirements and regulations could result in a breach of the law and subject us to fines, penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. At present, we do not have a strongly unionized workforce and we are not required to recognize any collective bargaining agreements. These conditions could change and any such changes could affect our ability to control costs and working practices of our employees. As a large employer we receive a number of claims from employees. Typically, these claims are for small amounts and we do not regard the aggregate value of such claims to be material. Claims can be brought against us in relation to alleged discrimination under certain “protected characteristics” set out in the UK Equality Act 2010 (such as race, sex and pregnancy) and these are not subject to a cap. As of March 31, 2023, we had nine such claims at employment tribunal stage and one at an early conciliation stage with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (“Acas”).

We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If relevant tax authorities challenge our tax positions, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the cost of our services to track and collect such taxes. In addition, we are and have been subject to various tax audits and may be subject to tax audits from time to time in the future. There can be no assurance that any such tax audits will be resolved in our favor and such audits could result in litigation or other regulatory proceedings being brought against us by the UK tax authority or other governmental agencies and tax authorities. In addition, there is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the future or new taxes introduced. For example, certain cities in the United Kingdom, such as Liverpool and Manchester, have introduced a levy, for hotel stays under the Local Government Act 2003 and the Business Improvement Districts (England) Regulations 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net external rent payable was equal to £235.3 million, or 25.9% of revenue. Our ability to operate our hotels or our leased sites depends on our right to use the premises demised by the relevant lease. Under the typical terms of the relevant leases, which generally have an initial term of 25 years, the landlord may enforce its right to terminate the lease if we fail to pay rent in a timely manner. A decline in our cash flow generation may result in our inability to fund our rental costs in a timely manner, and may lead to the termination of some or all of our leases. ----- Under most of our leases, we have a contractual or statutory right to renew the lease beyond the initial term, usually for another 25-year term. However, we are subject to the risk that we may not meet any applicable contractual extension conditions, thus preventing us from extending the term of the lease agreement and in certain circumstances, the level of rent charges at lease renewal may not be attractive to us and we may elect not to renew. As a result, we may not be able to extend our leases on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Conversely, many of our leases are reversionary leases, giving the landlord the option to grant us future rights of possession of the leased property that take effect at the expiration of the lease. As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the LXI Re-gear, the average remaining term on our leases, excluding renewal rights, was 17.7 years in the United Kingdom and 9.9 years in Spain. This option extends the term of the lease by the length of time that has passed since the expiration of the lease and the date the option is exercised. If a landlord exercises this option, we could be obligated under a lease for longer than we initially anticipated. Furthermore, our business may be adversely affected if a compulsory purchase order, which allows certain bodies to obtain land or property without the need for consent of the owner, were made in respect to any properties in which we have an interest, since we would no longer be able to use and occupy such property. Properties in the United Kingdom may be compulsorily acquired by, among others, a local authority or a governmental department in connection with redevelopment or infrastructure projects which are to the benefit of the public.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

A triple net lease designates the lessee as solely responsible for all costs relating to the property, such as property tax, building maintenance and buildings insurance. Most of our leases are subject to standard five-yearly upwards-only rent reviews, indexed against the RPI, RPIX or, increasingly, the CPI, while only a small number of our leases are subject to open market rent reviews. Rent reviews allow for periodical adjustment of our rent in order to adjust it to market level at the time of the review. Some of these leases have caps and collars, thus granting us an upper and lower limit on the rent adjustment, usually at 4% and 1% respectively. A small number have fixed uplifts of approximately 3% per annum. Due to the high fixed-cost structure of our leased properties, an increase in rental cost may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We intend to enter into agreements for future leases. These leases will create additional obligations on us. However, we can offer no assurance that these future leases will be on the same or similar terms, or as profitable, as our existing leases. The costs we incur under our leases, such as rent expense and property costs (i.e., council rates, utilities, insurance and service charges) constitute our primary, fixed costs, which may impede us from quickly adapting our operations to changes in our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net external rent payable accounted for 33.7% of our net operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and the rent phasing adjustment). We have limited or no control over these costs, and some of these costs may not be altered in a timely manner in response to changes in demand for services or a reduction in our revenues. If our revenue declines and we are unable to reduce our expenses in a timely manner, or are unable or unwilling to pass these costs on to our guests, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In the United Kingdom, the government adjusts the value of local authority business rates (local property taxes) to reflect changes in the property market approximately every three years. The most recent revaluation came into effect in England and Wales on April 1, 2023 (based on open market rental values from April 1, 2021) and new revaluations are expected in the near-term. At revaluation, all properties are given a new ratable value which, depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property, can have a significant impact on the tax liability due on the property.

Disagreements over the interpretation of contract provisions may be more likely when hotel profits are depressed as a result of general economic conditions. We seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relationships with current and potential landlords. However, failure to resolve such disagreements may lead to litigation between the parties, which could then result in outcomes that may be adverse to our economic interests. As a result of legal fees and the allocation and use of different resources, all landlord disputes can be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately decided in our favor. Moreover, we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation procedures, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with a third party. An adverse result in any of the aforementioned proceedings could have a material adverse effect in our results of operations. Furthermore, specific to the hotel industry, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to operators of third-party owned hotels, such as us, which means, among other things, that landlords may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination. In the event of any such termination, we may need to negotiate or enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims and incur significant legal fees and expenses. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement. Additionally, since these disagreements are more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions, we may not be able to recover any damages, even after having incurred significant legal fees and other expenses.

Upon identifying a market or type of property that is underperforming, we evaluate the terms of the agreements governing the underperforming hotels, the market conditions and the location of the hotel to determine if we can renegotiate the terms on a more favorable basis or if we should terminate the arrangements or otherwise dispose of the assets to ensure that our assets are aligned with our strategy. From time to time, we may decide to exit unprofitable leases or to selectively dispose of our interest in hotels to generate proceeds that can be used for working capital or to fund our growth in markets that will enhance and expand our brand presence. However, our lease agreements generally do not provide for early termination at our option without cause, and we may not be able to agree to favorable terms for the early termination of our leases with landlords, or at all, with the result that we may be required to continue to operate individual loss-making assets. We may incur significant costs in connection with the termination or renegotiation of such leases, and we cannot guarantee that the new lease terms will reflect current market conditions. Typically, our lease agreements include a minimum fixed rent payment obligation that is independent of the revenue generated by the hotel. In the event that we are unable to exit or renegotiate the terms of an unprofitable lease, we may have to continue to incur losses for the remaining term of the lease. In addition, under a number of our lease agreements, there are minimum repair obligations concerning the maintenance of the hotel. We will be required to make the investments regardless of whether the leased hotel generates any profits. As a result, the required investments and capital expenditures may exceed ----- the amount of revenue generated from operating the hotel or may increase the amount of the loss incurred. We may experience difficulty in terminating certain unprofitable leases and management agreements during periods of economic downturn due to the difficulty of finding replacement tenants and service providers that would be willing to enter into new agreements on terms acceptable to the landlord.

As of December 31, 2022, we had a secured pipeline of more than 22 new hotels and more than 2,100 rooms, including hotels under construction and under signed development contracts. The eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and, in particular, the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract, is subject to risks. It typically takes more than two to three years from the commencement of a project to the time we start to operate a new hotel. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our development pipeline, and in particular hotels not yet under contract, will result in new hotels that enter our system, or that those hotels will open when we anticipate. We may experience delays in developing our sites. If we are not able to begin operating properties as scheduled, our ability to compete effectively could be diminished and our revenue could be reduced.

From time to time, we consider and engage in negotiations with respect to new developments and other potential strategic transactions. If achieved, these transactions can have a material impact on our business. We generally use one of the following three strategies when developing new hotels: - we enter into an agreement for a lease with a landlord, who grants us the lease once development works are completed. This is the most common type of transaction that we undertake in the operation of our hotels. Usually, the agreement for a lease is conditional upon the landlord meeting our requirements for site acquisition, financing, vacant possession, and the granting of planning permission; - we enter into a forward-funded development plan whereby Travelodge, funded by a third party, carries out the development works. We have two of such transactions in our secured pipeline; or - from time to time, we acquire existing hotels as going concerns, rather than new build properties. In these circumstances, the terms of the purchase vary greatly from deal to deal. Generally, the transaction is structured so that we enter into an agreement with the estate owner and/or the landlord and any existing operator whereby we acquire certain elements of the business and assets of the existing operator and a leasehold interest in the hotel and subsequently re-brand and refurbish the hotel as a Travelodge. When entering into these strategies, we may be competing for opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do, causing us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we might otherwise have paid absent such competition. Additionally, we may enter into partnership or joint venture agreements in which we hold a minority stake and are therefore able to exercise less influence over operational decisions. The success of our development and acquisition strategies depend on our ability to identify suitable sites or targets, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of such sites or targets and to negotiate acceptable purchase or rental terms. As a result of our development and acquisition strategies, we may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and costs, or we may incur significant additional debt or equity financing, spend existing cash or incur liabilities and other expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill.

For example, our leasehold properties may be registered with good leasehold title and not absolute title or may be subject to encumbrances, easements benefitting adjoining properties such as rights to use conduits or shared access ways. Our hotels may also be subject to restrictive covenants including, for example, covenants not to use the property so as to cause a nuisance. Our hotels may be subject to other covenants we are not presently aware of. Furthermore, a number of the titles to our hotels may have minor defects. Leases we have only entered into recently may still be in the process of being registered at the land registry and title to such hotels will not be perfected until such time as the registration is complete.

We also depend on a limited number of IT service providers to supply our central property management system, price setting system and web and other IT hosting services. Our credit ----- card processing providers in particular require compliance with certain standards, including data management and other standards known as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and regulations. These standards are subject to change and there is a risk that changes may require additional investment and that any persistent or significant failure on our behalf to adhere to these standards could cause a withdrawal of their service. Although we have an ongoing program of data protection enhancement developed in connection with our providers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the standards set by our providers. If any third-party service provider on which we rely in conducting our business does not satisfactorily perform its services, or imposes conditions on us in order to continue to provide those services, we in turn may not be able to provide adequate hotel facilities and services to our customers, which in turn may impact revenue and profitability. Negative publicity or reviews by customers resulting from the actions of outsourcing partners and third-party suppliers could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and brands. Adverse changes in any of our relationships with outsourcing partners and third party suppliers or the inability to enter into new relationships with these parties on commercially favorable terms, or at all, could adversely affect our operations or otherwise cause disruption. Our arrangements with outsourcing partners and third-party suppliers may not remain in effect on current or similar terms, and the net impact of future pricing options may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate for foreseeable losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable for our industry. Nevertheless, market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we can obtain in the future or restrict our ability to continue to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Insurance costs may increase substantially in the future and may be affected by natural catastrophes, fear of terrorism, intervention by the government or a decrease in the number of insurance carriers. In addition, the recent disruption in the financial markets makes it more difficult to evaluate the stability of insurance companies or their ability to meet their payment obligations. In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations or the replacement cost of any lost investment. Certain types of losses that are significantly uncertain can be uninsurable or too expensive to insure. If an uninsured loss were to occur, we could experience significant disruption to our operations, suffer significant losses and be required to make significant payments for which we would not be compensated, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Alternatively, we could lose some or all the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future net turnover from the property.

In order to place our listings with a search engine, we frequently place bids on key words at a certain cost per click or other chargeable model that we pay to the search engine. Under the bidding system, the order in which websites appear in a search engine’s paid search results is determined by a combination of the price bid by the website and the historical and expected rate at which consumers click through to the website. Bids on generic search terms (such as “hotel”) typically cost more than bids on branded search terms (such as “Travelodge”). The click-through rate is, in turn, influenced by factors including the strength of the website’s brand and the popularity of the website. There has been significant consolidation in the digital search space, with both search engines and online intermediaries gaining significant market power. Costs for securing positions in these channels depend on many variables, including brand strength, click-through rates, conversion and commercial terms to the counterparties. Costs for bidding on online search terms or online advertising may increase in the future, with an adverse impact on our expenses.

The Indenture also permits the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness, including on a contractually senior basis in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral is secured in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of itself, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedge counterparties, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the holders of the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral will be applied first to repay amounts due under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations, as well as any additional indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to be incurred and secured in priority to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Any remaining amounts will then be applied, pari passu and pro rata, to amounts due under the Notes and certain other pari passu additional indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

In addition, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any amounts due on the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.","No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering and the book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Collateral in the event of an enforcement of the security interests created over the Collateral, or a liquidation of the entities holding the Collateral, is subject to fluctuations and will depend on regulatory approval, market and economic conditions, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, competition, the availability of buyers and other factors. Such factors include, among others, conditions in our industry, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which the Collateral is located, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates, the liquidity of the Collateral, whether the business is sold as a going concern and similar factors. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. By its nature, the Collateral may be intangible or illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. For example, the shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned or transferred for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, even if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Furthermore, any shares pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings because all of the obligations (subject to the release mechanism in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, potentially leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. See “—The Notes Guarantees _and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” In addition, the_ Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders under the Senior Facilities, counterparties to certain hedging agreements and other super senior liabilities have been repaid in full. Moreover, the value of the Collateral may be diluted. The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens over the Collateral to certain parties in addition to the holders of the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Similarly, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, ----- holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral. In the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the Notes Guarantees and Collateral provided by us and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Collateral may also be affected by local law limitations. See “—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to _certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_ As a result of the foregoing, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

The existence of any such restrictions, exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among other things, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, or participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Furthermore, the enforcement of a security interest by the Security Agent may require the completion of judicial proceedings in the jurisdiction in which the security interest will be released. There is no assurance that the Security Agent will successfully complete such judicial proceedings in a timely manner or that other practical problems relating to the foreclosure of Collateral will be overcome by the Security Agent at all or without a material delay. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, our business requires a variety of permits and licenses. Our business is subject to regulations and requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. Furthermore, our leases generally provide that the leases may not be assigned to third parties without the landlord’s consent such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and that the landlord may terminate (forfeit) the leases upon an insolvency event affecting us, thereby affecting the charges over certain of our leases included in the Collateral. The landlord’s ability to effect such termination (forfeiture) rights upon the occurrence of an insolvency event would require the approval of the court or an administrator (as applicable) and would be subject to the tenant’s statutory right to apply to the courts for relief from forfeiture, such relief usually being granted where the breach is remedied (if remediable) or compensation is paid and where the court is satisfied that the tenant will perform its obligations in the future; however, there is no assurance that our leases would not be terminated in any enforcement action by holders of the Notes or otherwise. The Collateral will consist of fixed and floating charges over substantially all assets and a significant number of contracts of the Issuer and the Guarantors but will exclude any contract which contains a prohibition on granting security by way of fixed or floating charges, whether that prohibition is conditional or unconditional, and will exclude any contract in which the contract counterparty would have a termination right if security were granted over such contract. Therefore, the majority of our leases will be excluded from the Collateral. If the number of leases that are not part of the Collateral represents a significant part of our assets at the time of an enforcement, then this may affect your ability to appoint an out-of-court administrator (rather than a court-appointed administrator) if you seek to enforce your rights under the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee for the Notes, who may provide instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Notes Guarantee will provide holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture and Notes Guarantees will provide that certain Notes Guarantees, and the Indenture and the relevant Security Documents will provide that certain security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or in respect of which security interests may be granted by the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or security provider, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, or causing the directors or officers of the Guarantor or security provider to incur personal civil or criminal liability. Each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest. In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, set-off counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void all or part of a Notes Guarantee or any security interest, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or realized from enforcing a security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another or to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor ----- or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the granting of the Notes Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest was not validly established or authorized or otherwise contravenes the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s articles of association or similar organizational documents; - the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest was held not to be in the best interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or - the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or realized from enforcing the relevant security interest were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future Notes Guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued or security interest was granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. ----- If a court were to find that the granting of a Notes Guarantee or the security interest in the Collateral was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, any other Guarantor or security provider under any Notes Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. If any Notes Guarantee or Security Document is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee or Security Document obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider that do not benefit from the Notes Guarantee and/or the Security Document that have been rendered invalid or unenforceable and excluding any liabilities under any Proceeds Loan and Subordinated Shareholder Loans (if applicable). Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge or charge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Unless a subsidiary is a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the actions we are required to take to perfect any of these liens.

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and other then-existing contractual restrictions may prohibit us from purchasing the Notes upon a change of control without first repaying the Senior Facilities in full. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all.

We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for the Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes. Therefore, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or price, if at all. ----- Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market and may give rise to withholding tax (in the event the Notes are not listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the UK Income Tax Act 2007).",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We leased, franchised, managed and owned 595 hotels and approximately 46,000 rooms throughout the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland as of December 31, 2022. We operate in the midscale and economy (“MS&E”) segment of the hotel market (as defined by STR) and are positioned as a budget operator, offering standardized, modern guest rooms at affordable prices to both business and leisure customers. Our purpose is to provide affordable travel for everyone and we aim to offer our customers the right balance of location, price and quality for their travel needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had brand recognition of 98% among the UK population (as measured by a YouGov brand tracking survey), driven by our long-standing market presence, wide geographic network and effective marketing initiatives. We operate multiple room formats across our hotels, namely our core standard rooms (43,442 in 595 hotels as of December 31, 2022), which include twin, family and accessible rooms, and our “premium economy” SuperRooms (2,319 in 64 hotels across the United Kingdom and Ireland as of December 31, 2022). We estimate that we attracted approximately 21 million customers in 2022, well exceeding our previous pre-COVID-19 pandemic peak of approximately 19 million customers in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. We operate a lean, low-cost operating model, with a relatively small support office and a high proportion of hourly paid team members in hotels. We employ approximately 12,000 people across our hotels and support offices, the majority of whom work in our hotels on hourly paid contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 45,761 rooms in 595 hotels under the Travelodge brand. Within our largest market, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), representing 98% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 43,914 rooms (or 96% of total rooms) in 579 hotels, with 9,888 rooms (or 23% of UK rooms) in 79 hotels located in London and 34,026 rooms (or 77% of UK rooms) in 500 hotels located in regional areas across the United Kingdom. The majority of our hotels in the United Kingdom are leasehold. We also operate one hotel under a freehold and 10 hotels under management contracts in the United Kingdom. ----- As of December 31, 2022, 1,226 rooms in 11 hotels were operated under franchise in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including a new central Dublin City Center hotel opened in 2022, and we operated 621 rooms in five hotels under leasehold in Spain. In early 2023, we opened our first new Spanish hotel in over ten years in Madrid. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR of £909.9 million, £212.9 million and £52.59, respectively, compared to £727.9 million, £129.1 million and £42.46 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2022, our revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR grew at a CAGR of 7.7%, 18.2% and 7.4%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had Occupancy and an Average Room Rate of 81.8% and £64.31, respectively, compared to 80.8% and £52.51 for the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.1,General Economic Conditions and Growth in Our Sector of the Hotel Market,"As the second largest hotel brand in the United Kingdom, our business depends on customer demand for our rooms and the related services that we provide, which are in turn dependent on the general state of the hotel and travel industry, primarily in the United Kingdom, where we had 568 leasehold hotels (excluding hotels we operate under management contracts) and one owned hotel as of December 31, 2022. Our UK hotels (including fees received under management contracts relating to 11 hotels we operate and the Irish franchise) accounted for £895.3 million, or 98.4%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we have five leased hotels in Spain, which accounted for £14.7 million, or 1.5%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Performance in the hotel industry in the locations where we operate is closely linked to global, European and UK economic growth. In particular, the UK hotel market performance is linked to economic growth and growth of RevPAR is generally closely aligned with GDP growth over time. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted hotel operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR, we believe that this will normalize in the future. Other macro-economic factors influence demand for hotel accommodation and/or increase costs for our hotels, particularly increases in inflation or interest rates, consumer spending and consumer confidence, business investment, employment levels, wages (including the National Living Wage), and public spending on temporary accommodation. Inflation particularly has increased generally in 2022, with ----- notable increases in the unit costs of both electricity and gas. The impact of the Ukraine conflict has contributed to this increase and could cause sustained inflationary pressures if not concluded in the short term. The cost of living crisis, driven by high levels of inflation, also has the potential to impact demand and consumer choices. However, the budget sector where we operate has historically demonstrated a strong resilience and has the potential to overcome adverse macro-economic factors, with customers usually trading down to budget hotels during difficult economic periods. We operate in the MS&E segment which in 2022 generated £4.9 billion of revenue from 247,062 rooms, which accounted for 36% of the total number of rooms in the UK, according to STR. We are positioned as a budget operator, offering standardized, modern guest rooms at affordable prices to both business and leisure customers. The largest operators in the MS&E segment are us and our main competitor, Premier Inn. The MS&E segment has historically demonstrated strong growth and resilience throughout economic cycles, with the top two hotel brands by number of hotels and number of rooms in the United Kingdom both positioned in the MS&E segment, according to STR. In addition, budget operators have historically shown stronger resilience than the wider industry across the hotel cycle. Following a decline in 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK hotel industry recovered strongly during 2022 despite the inflation and cost of living crisis, benefiting from increased consumer demand across both leisure and business. According to STR, the MS&E segment showed the strongest recovery across the UK market and ended 2022 significantly ahead of 2019, which had a positive impact on our results of operations in 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.2,The COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the UK and the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stayat-home directives in place at various times during the period, resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in travel resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the areas where our hotels are located, including the closure of the overwhelming majority of our hotels from March 24, 2020, to July 4, 2020. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a Company Voluntary Arrangement (“CVA”) in the UK that was approved by creditors on June 19, 2020. The CVA provided for (i) no planned hotel closures and no permanent rent reductions, (ii) a temporary reduction in rents in 2020 and 2021, (iii) £240 million in the form of a new £60 million credit facility, £40 million of additional capital, the use of significant cash reserves (approximately £100 million prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) and the drawdown of our existing £40 million revolving credit facility, and (iv) cash conservation including operating and capital cost savings and the utilization of the available government COVID-19 related support. In the UK, we accessed government support in the form of the Job Retention Scheme and the retail, hospitality and leisure business rates holiday. The rent reductions under the CVA ended at the end of 2021 and we paid full rents in 2022. The CVA completed on January 19, 2023. The CVA agreement includes an excess cumulative EBITDA landlord rent payment clause, whereby if the cumulative EBITDA (adjusted) from 2020 to 2022 is more than £200 million, two-thirds of the excess will be payable to landlords, adjusted as appropriate for the impact of any subsequent agreements made with individual landlords on their individual payments. As a result of our performance in 2022, we are required to make a one-off payment of approximately £13 million in April 2023. Following the lifting of restrictions in the UK on May 17, 2021, demand and revenue gradually improved to return to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of September 2021. This trend continued and was driven predominantly by higher rates but also higher occupancy levels resulting from (i) strong ----- domestic leisure demand, (ii) a rapid recovery in “blue collar” business demand and (iii) gradual recovery in “white collar,” together resulting in quick recovery and performance above 2019 levels by early February 2022. We also benefited from strong event demand, including the Commonwealth Games and the Queen’s funeral. The gradual recovery from COVID-19 has been experienced in the MS&E segment as a whole, which has now achieved and surpassed 2019 figures. The MS&E Segment revenues have increased by 19.5% from 2019 to 2022, driven by greater pricing power and higher occupancy numbers as a result of the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. ARR and Occupancy figures are also higher than 2019 by 16.9% and 1.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We have high occupancies in the summer, and tend to perform strongest when there is both strong business and leisure demand. Our occupancy is lowest, and we may incur a loss, during the first quarter of each year, where there is softer general business demand and lower levels of leisure demand, especially in seasonal resorts. Our first quarter revenue is also negatively affected when Easter occurs in the first quarter of the year due to fewer business travelers, though this is partially offset by an increase in leisure travelers. An early Easter also generally sees less leisure demand than one later in the second quarter, but this is also impacted by the weather and proximity to other bank holidays and half term holidays. Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonal weather conditions, including natural disasters such as floods and other adverse weather and climate conditions. Mild weather may increase occupancy levels in leisure destinations, particularly during peak travel season. Weather also typically affects our energy costs, which increase when there is abnormally severe or prolonged cold or hot weather.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair and an upgraded bathroom. Our new design also delivers a new style bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work. In 2022, we upgraded 64 hotels and over 6,000 rooms (approximately 14% of the room estate) with our new design, with positive commercial and customer feedback, and we plan to upgrade over 4,000 rooms (approximately 10% of the room estate) in 2023. We plan to refit the entire estate over the next seven-year refit cycle, with interim works during this cycle in selected hotels. These strategic investments have are having a positive impact on both customer and commercial metrics, including RevPAR. We also made various investments as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our number one priority is the safety and security of our customers and teams. In 2020, we created TravelodgeProtect+, a program of cleaning and social distancing measures, designed to keep our guests and teams safe and give everyone peace of mind. The program was developed by a dedicated cross-functional hygiene strategy team after discussion with our peers and industry group bodies, such as the UK Hospitality Association. We also continued our investments in cleaning with the roll-out of robot vacuums across the estate, helping to reduce the physical demands of the job for our team members, reducing our energy consumption and delivering cost efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Our pricing is centrally managed by a dedicated team, which uses ----- an optimized revenue management system. We completed a major revenue management system upgrade in 2019, which in conjunction with investments in our data and analytics capability, has enhanced our strong performance after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenue management system uses all available information to forecast occupancy at each hotel and to optimize prices. Our rates are updated three times per day as internal and external factors change. We have a dedicated events team to monitor key events, such as large attendance concerts, sports events and cultural events, to set and adjust event specific pricing based on forecast demand. Our centralized team uses high-quality reporting, benchmarking and data analytics to monitor performance and adjust pricing in real time to further optimize the prices charged. We believe that optimized revenue management will continue to positively contribute to our performance. We have implemented significant improvements to our online platform to enhance the booking experience for our business customers. These include our Travelodge Business and Travelodge Business Pay products designed with small and medium enterprises in mind but which also offer noteworthy efficiencies and benefits for larger companies. These products include a dedicated website for businesses, detailed reporting functionality to enable customers to manage their bookings and travel spend with greater ease, as well as a simplified and improved booking journey which also offers a discount on our most flexible rates. Additionally, we have partnered with a third-party provider to offer Travelodge Business Pay, an interest-free credit facility for our business customers.

We continue to maintain strong brand recognition through a wide range of marketing activities, including extensive investment in direct sales, digital marketing, traditional offline marketing and an ongoing presence in the media, both nationally and locally. The majority of our investments in marketing are focused on strengthening our digital presence, which supports more than 80% of our bookings. We seek to maintain our presence in organic search through paid investments in digital advertising and sponsored links where appropriate. We conduct most of our marketing efforts through digital, online advertising and search engine optimization in order to appeal to customers who are searching for and comparing hotel options online. We plan to continue to focus on developing our web offer and driving conversion through better user experience, with an emphasis on attracting business customers and repeat stays.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.7,"Occupancy, ARR and RevPAR","Revenue from our existing hotels is primarily affected by Occupancy and ARR. Both Occupancy and ARR are strongly correlated to general economic conditions, the strength of the travel industry and the supply of and demand for hotel accommodation in a specific market. We believe that the strength of our brand, the geographic distribution of our hotel portfolio and our different operating models allow us to diversify risks related to specific hotels in our portfolio. In order to react appropriately to developments in our local markets, we continuously monitor Occupancy, ARR and RevPAR of our hotels. _Occupancy_ Occupancy is the quotient of the total number of Room Nights sold during a specified period divided by the total number of rooms available for each day during that period. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels’ available room capacity. We use Occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period at the rates charged. Demand is principally driven by the need ----- for general business travel, leisure travel including the propensity of people to visit friends and relatives, special events such as sporting events, concerts and conferences, as well as other events in the hotel’s proximity. Occupancy is affected by the rate strategy we deploy, which sets prices, and by the supply of hotel rooms in the area surrounding each of our hotels, and increases in hotel room supply, which can increase competition and make it more difficult to achieve high Occupancy. _Average Room Rate (ARR)_ Average Room Rate is the quotient of total room revenues for a specified period divided by total Room Nights sold during that period. There is usually a positive correlation between rate and Occupancy, and we aim to maximize RevPAR with our revenue management strategy. _RevPAR_ RevPAR is the product of the Average Room Rate for a specified period multiplied by the Occupancy for that period. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, as well as Wi-Fi, parking and other guest services. We use RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues of comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry. We believe that a change in RevPAR is a reliable indicator of a change in revenue from our hotels because RevPAR takes into account both ARR and Occupancy. However, RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by changes in Occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes that are driven predominately by changes in ARR. For example, assuming the same room rates and variable operating costs, including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs, increases in Occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues compared to lower levels of Occupancy and such increased Occupancy may also result in increased ancillary revenues, including food and beverage. In contrast, changes in ARR typically have a greater effect on margins and profitability, because rates increase while variable operating costs remain relatively stable. We regularly review our occupancy and rate forecasts, which have been stress tested with plausible but conservative changes to assumptions including cost of living crisis and other macroeconomic shocks.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.8,Rent Expense,"A significant portion of our other operating expenses (before IFRS 16) is rent expense, which is primarily determined by our ability to negotiate favorable terms under new lease agreements, the rental prices in the region in which our hotels are located and the predominantly RPI related growth rates applied to our existing leases. We typically rent our hotels under 25 to 35 year triple net leases with various landlords. Typically, new leases have a six month initial rent free period and an upwards only rent review every five years, most commonly linked to RPI growth with caps and collars. We also receive rental income on some sites where we sublet space to third parties. A small portion of our rent expense results from a variable rent component under our leases which is tied to the revenue level we generate at the relevant leased hotel. In the last three years our rent expenses were impacted by the CVA implemented in 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CVA completed on January 19, 2023. In January 2023, we also completed the LXI Re-gear, which, among other things, moved rent reviews to a CPI + 0.5% per annum basis with caps and collars (4% per annum and 1% per annum, respectively) replacing the previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews. In addition, the unexpired lease terms on 97 hotels were extended by a weighted average of nine years and the parties agreed “rent-smoothing” of the hotels on a site by site basis, to ensure that each hotel has a robust standalone Rent Cover. We expect to re-gear leases for an additional 25 hotels, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, in the second quarter of 2023. See “Business—Operating Models—LXI Re-gear.” In 2023, we estimate rent costs of approximately £250 million to £260 million, reflecting the impact of rent reviews and new hotel openings in 2022 and 2023. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.9,"Operating Expenses (Other than Rent, Depreciation/Amortization and Non-underlying items)","In parallel with significant investments to improve the quality of our rooms and expand our offering, we have also made investments aimed at streamlining operational delivery, improving the quality of service and in turn the overall customer experience. Operating expenses (excluding rent, depreciation/amortization and non-underlying items), have increased principally due to the increase in occupancy levels in 2022 and the impact of inflation, increasing employee costs following the end of the UK government’s job retention scheme in 2021 and the increase in the National Living Wage, the end of the hospitality business rates holiday in Wales and Scotland and of government support grants, increased costs associated with increased trading such as utilities, maintenance and transaction fees, higher marketing spend and increased costs from new and maturing hotels. In 2023, we estimate cost inflation of approximately 7% to 8%. This reflects the significant inflationary pressures facing the wider UK economy, as well as some specific price increases impacting laundry and food and beverage and the impact of our hedged energy position. One of the largest components of our operating expenses is employee costs and our financial results are impacted by our ability to manage these costs. Our employee base varies throughout the year and we employ approximately 12,000 employees on varying hours and contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we employed 7,832 average fulltime equivalent employees in our UK operations and 75 in our international operations. The large majority of our employees work in our hotels. We estimate that approximately 87% of our employees are paid hourly. In April 2023, the National Living Wage in the UK increased from £9.50 per hour to £10.42 per hour for all workers over 23 years old. We offer the over 23 year old National Living Wage as a minimum to staff of all ages. We expect to continue to closely manage our employee costs. In response to the increased National Living Wage we have and we continue to focus on ways to improve our efficiency, including more effective rostering and greater use of an appropriate full-time/part time mix in each hotel, and in common with many other hotel businesses, we will seek to pass on elements of the cost increase to customers in the form of higher charges. We seek to control our employee costs by forecasting our needs based upon anticipated business volume, including Occupancy, and food and beverage sales. Recently, employee costs have increased due to our efforts to improve our central office operations and the service quality in our hotels. At our hotels, we have invested in extra bar café staff hours, additional training and increased staff hours in some hotels to improve quality, while, at our central office, we have grown our sales, digital, marketing, revenue management and operational support teams. During 2022 we continued to focus on cost management, including implementing procurement best practice, following the recruitment of a new procurement function. Increasing inflation caused increases in expenses, such as cost of sales, including laundry and food and beverage. We started commercial negotiations to manage increases in several significant operating costs, including energy, food and beverage and linen. To help manage energy costs, we use flexible energy contracts which allow the fixing of electricity and gas prices through the term of the contract. We renewed our energy contracts in early 2023 and we entered into hedging agreements for the majority of the year under a purchasing framework to minimize risk and maximize the opportunity for future price reductions. In 2023, we estimate energy costs to increase from 2022 levels by high single digit millions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We base our decision to open new hotels on the expected financial performance of the hotel, using a detailed appraisal of the local market characteristics, local competition and an analysis of historic performance of comparable hotels within our network. We do not typically build our own hotels and therefore we do not typically take on direct development or planning risk. Instead, we partner with a wide range of developers, including large scale developers and regional companies, who build our hotels and then transfer them to us in the manner of a leasehold ----- obligation. We agree a rental period and fee and oversee progress on development to ensure the site meets our specifications. The majority of the capital spent is for the account of the developer, and our rent obligations usually only begin once a hotel is successfully handed over to us. Development costs vary according to location and building configuration, but typically range between £80,000 and £90,000 per room excluding land (excluding certain locations such as London, where such costs are higher). Assets typically take two to three years from entering our pipeline to opening, with the first year or so being primarily planning and the second year or so consisting of construction and fit-out. However, currently build cost issues and the unavailability of financing have caused delays. Newly opened hotels usually breakeven within the first year and take around two years to fully mature, affecting our profitability during this initial ramp-up period. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we opened six new hotels (including London Docklands Central, which replaced an existing hotel, and the Irish franchise in Dublin City Center). As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into agreements to lease more than 22 new hotels with more than 2,100 rooms (our “secured pipeline”). We currently expect to spend approximately £5 million in development costs in 2023 related to new hotel openings. We believe that our secured pipeline is strong, and that our management team has a proven track record of delivering new hotels on budget. New openings could be delayed due to unforeseen events, including weather and labor issues and resource constraints in the construction industry.

A portion of our revenue from providing accommodation is derived through prepaid room bookings, all revenue from accommodation is recognized when customers check-in at our hotels, over the period of stay. We also derive revenue from food and beverage sales, car parking, Wi-Fi and vending machines. Under management agreements, we provide hotel management services. Base and incentive management fees are typically charged. Base management fees are typically a percentage of total hotel revenues and incentive management fees are generally based on the hotel’s profitability. Both are treated as variable consideration. Base management fees are recognized as the underlying hotel revenues occur. Incentive management fees are recognized over time when it is considered highly probable that the related performance criteria will be met, provided there is no expectation of a subsequent reversal of the revenue.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.10,(Loss) for the period ................................** **(0.4)** **(60.5)** **59.9** **(106.0)** **44.1** **(54.1),17.10.2,,"(1) These items are presented before non-underlying items. _Revenue_ Revenue increased by £350.1 million, or 62.5%, from £559.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £909.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the lifting of the work from home guidance, which resulted in quick performance recovery. This trend continued and was driven predominantly by higher rates but also higher occupancy levels benefiting from strong domestic leisure demand and a rapid recovery in “blue collar” business demand together with a more gradual recovery in “white collar” corporate demand. We also benefited from a reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector of 12.5% in the first quarter of 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the business heavily. In early 2021, restrictions throughout the UK mandated that guests were only allowed to stay in hotels for work, education or other legally permitted reasons but not for leisure purposes. We started 2021 with 354 UK hotels open and trading, with closures in the first couple weeks which reduced this number to 293 by January 15, 2021 and we ended January with 295 open hotels. Certain hotels were opened through February, March, April and May with all available hotels open by May 15, 2021. Following the lifting of restrictions in the UK on May 17, 2021, demand and revenue gradually improved to the end of September 2021. Like-for-like UK RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2022 improved by 59.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. ----- _Operating Expenses_ Operating expenses increased by £162.1 million, or 54.0%, from £300.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the higher trading levels in 2022 as all hotels reopened progressively in 2021 following the easing of lock-down restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Costs were also impacted, to a lesser extent, by inflationary pressures. The cost of goods sold increased by £21.3 million, or 79.2%, from £26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase resulted primarily from higher laundry costs, which were driven by higher occupancy levels and supplier price increases, and lower food and beverage costs in 2021 due to hotel closures, extended bar café closures and inflation. Employee costs increased by £55.6 million, or 36.9%, from £150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £206.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher trading in 2022 levels as all hotels reopened progressively in 2021 following the easing of lockdown restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the end of the UK government’s job retention scheme, the impact of the increase in the National Living Wage in the UK and recruiting additional staff in our new and maturing hotels. We made claims of approximately £21 million in respect of the UK government’s job retention scheme for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, in 2022, employees (other than senior management) received cost of living vouchers, at a gross cost of £4.0 million. Other operating expenses increased by £85.2 million, or 69.4%, from £122.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the end of the hospitality business rates holiday in Scotland and Wales that resulted in an approximately £1.0 million benefit in 2022 relative to a £21.0 million benefit in 2021, government support grants of £9.7 million in 2021 compared to approximately £1.8 million received in the first half of 2022, higher marketing spend, increased costs associated with all hotels being open in 2022 compared to 2021, such as utilities and maintenance, higher transaction fees due to the level of bookings and increased costs from new and maturing hotels. _Net External Rent Payable_ Net external rent payable (before rent phasing adjustment) decreased by £0.8 million, from £4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to £3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net external rent payable (before rent phasing adjustment and before IFRS 16) increased by £56.0 million, or 31.2%, from £179.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £235.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of rent reductions in the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately £55 million. The impact of new hotels, together with upwards only rent reviews predominantly linked to RPI, also contributed to the increase in rent payable. _Loss on Disposal of Fixed Assets_ Loss on disposal of fixed assets was £7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was related to the write off of assets as a result of our hotel refurbishment program. _Depreciation/Amortization_ Depreciation increased by £9.6 million, from £144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to £154.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation (before IFRS 16) remained relatively stable at £40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to £41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation is driven mainly by ongoing investment in maintenance and the refurbishment of our estate, including health and safety measures, energy ----- efficiency projects, IT hardware and new hotel openings. Increases due to the restart of our ongoing hotel refurbishment program were offset by the impairment of a small number of assets in 2021. Amortization decreased by £1.2 million, from £5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to £3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Amortization (before IFRS 16) decreased by £1.9 million, or 11.8%, from £16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Amortization is driven mainly by historical lease premiums, investment in IT systems (which result in an intangible asset) and new hotel openings. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of a small number of assets in 2021 and fully written down computer software. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs before interest on investor loan increased by £14.8 million, from £227.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to £242.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Finance costs before interest on investor loan (before IFRS 16) increased by £6.0 million, or 13.6%, from £44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was predominantly due to higher interest payments on floating rate debt, which were driven by an increase in SONIA rates in 2022, partially offset by lower interest on our revolving credit facility due to the full repayment of drawings in May 2022 and the repayment of our term loan facility in October 2022. Investor loan interest remained relatively stable at £20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to £20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Finance Income_ Finance income comprising interest on loans to related parties and bank interest increased by £1.7 million, from £0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £1.9 million for the year end December 31, 2022. The increase was due to an increase in cash balances and the base rate during the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Revenue was heavily impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. In early 2021, restrictions throughout the UK mandated that guests were only allowed to stay in hotels for work, education or other legally permitted reasons but not for leisure purposes. We started 2021 with 354 UK hotels open and trading, with closures in the first couple weeks which reduced this number to 293 by January 15, 2021 and we ended January with 295 open hotels. Certain hotels were opened through February, March, April and May with all available hotels open by May 15, 2021. Following the lifting of restrictions in the UK on May 17, 2021, demand and revenue gradually improved to the end of September 2021. Trading decline during the festive period at the end of the year and cancelations increased on the news of the Omicron variant and the work from home guidance in the UK. Conversely, we experienced strong revenue growth at the beginning of 2020, before COVID-19 began to impact the business from March 2020, with the first closure of our UK hotels mandated from March 24, 2020. The first lockdown restrictions eventually concluded on July 15, 2020. While 51 hotels remained open during the first lockdown period as part of our commitment to support NHS workers, key workers and vulnerable groups, these contributed negligible net income and overall revenues throughout the second quarter of 2020 were virtually eliminated. A phased reopening of our hotels was undertaken during a six to seven week period from early July 2020 to the middle of August 2020, with the effects of the pandemic continuing to heavily impact the third quarter of 2020. The imposition of new tiered restrictions throughout the UK in the final quarter of 2020 resulted in further hotel closures, with guests only allowed to stay in hotels for work, education or other legally permitted reasons but not for leisure purposes. ----- Like-for-like UK RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved by 99.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. _Operating Expenses_ Operating expenses increased by £72.2 million, or 31.7%, from £228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £300.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We managed costs tightly in 2021 as the impact of the pandemic continued, resulting in a lower ratio of operating expenses relative to revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The cost of goods sold increased by £9.4 million, or 53.7%, from £17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase resulted primarily from higher laundry costs driven by higher occupancy levels. Employee costs increased by £37.0 million, or 32.6%, from £113.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a reduction in the use of the UK government’s job retention scheme, the impact of the increase in the National Living Wage and recruiting additional staff in our new and maturing hotels. We made claims of approximately £21 million in respect of the UK government’s job retention scheme for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating expenses increased by £25.8 million, or 26.6%, from £97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £122.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher trading levels in 2021, increased costs from new and maturing hotels and reduced hospitality business rates benefits in 2021 of approximately £21 million, partially offset by savings from cost efficiency programs and business grants of approximately £10 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Net External Rent Payable_ Net external rent payable (before rent phasing adjustment) increased by £1.3 million, from £2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to £4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net external rent payable (before rent phasing adjustment and before IFRS 16) increased by £49.3 million, or 37.9%, from £130.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £179.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2020, rent was paid in full for the first quarter before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant rent reductions were agreed for the remainder of 2020 (totaling approximately £85 million) and 2021 (totaling approximately £55 million) as part of the CVA in June 2020. While we continued to benefit from the rent reductions in 2021, these reductions were lower than those in 2020. The impact of new hotels, together with upwards only rent reviews predominantly linked to RPI, also contributed to the increase in rent payable. _Depreciation/Amortization_ Depreciation decreased by £2.4 million, from £146.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to £144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation (before IFRS 16) increased by £4.6 million, or 12.6%, from £36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase resulted primarily from ongoing investment in the refurbishment of our estate, including health and safety measures, energy efficiency projects, IT hardware and new hotel openings. Amortization increased by £0.4 million, from £4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to £5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amortization (before IFRS 16) remained relatively stable at £16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to £16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amortization was driven primarily by historical lease premiums, investment in IT systems (which result in an intangible asset), new openings, partially offset by reductions resulting from the impairment of historical lease premiums for a small number of assets in 2020. ----- _Finance Costs_ Finance costs before interest on investor loan increased by £19.0 million, from £208.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to £227.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Finance costs before investor loan interest (before IFRS 16) increased by £8.5 million, or 23.8%, from £35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the impact of increased debt incurred in 2020 to fund liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bond interest costs increased by £4.1 million following the issuance of the £65 million Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes in December 2020, partially offset by the impact of the decrease in LIBOR. We drew £40 million under our existing revolving credit facility in March 2020 and £30 million in June 2020 under a new super revolving credit facility put in place in April 2020. We then drew £60 million under a new term loan facility entered into in December 2020 that replaced the £60 million super senior revolving credit facility. There was additional amortization of capitalized bond issuance costs and other capitalized costs related to the refinancing in December 2020, partially offset by lower interest on finance leases following the surrender of a property lease in June 2020. We borrowed additional debt to fund liquidity during 2020 in response to the COVID-10 pandemic. Investor loan interest increased by £5.1 million, or 33.8%, from £15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to £20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to the investment of £40 million from our shareholders in the Group, of which £10 million was received on August 24, 2020 and £30 million on December 2, 2020. _Finance Income_ Finance income remained relatively stable at £0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to £0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Following the Issue Date, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and our Senior Facilities. In connection with the Refinancing, on or about the Issue Date we intend to enter into the Senior Facilities Agreement, which provides for the £50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and the £30.0 million Letter of Credit Facility. While the Revolving Credit Facility is not currently expected to be drawn as of the Issue Date, we will have issued letters of credit in an aggregate amount of £27.2 million under the Letter of Credit Facility as of the Issue Date. Our financial condition and liquidity have been, and are expected to continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including: - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations; - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our finance costs; - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks; - our rent expenses; - our capital expenditure requirements; and - our level of acquisition and development activity. Our principal uses of funds are expected to consist mainly of funding capital expenditures and acquisitions or development activity, servicing indebtedness and financing working capital. As at the ----- date of this offering memorandum, after taking into account our current cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flow from operating and financing activities, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for our present requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

This increase resulted primarily from a £156.9 million operating result improvement (after non-underlying items) and an increase of £0.4 million in the adjustment for depreciation, amortization and profit on disposal of fixed assets, partially offset by a £9.7 million of working capital outflow (predominantly due to the effect of the rent reductions agreed under the CVA on the “payable” resulting from spreading the CVA benefit over the life of lease, a decrease in prepaid room inflows following the reopening benefit in 2021 and an increase in rent prepayments following the rent reductions in 2021, partially offset by the increase in the VAT creditor) and a £0.4 million reduction in corporation tax repayments.

Additionally, we generally pay vendors as well as staff once at the end of every calendar month in arrears, although weekly paid staff are on a 4-weekly payment cycle.

Impairment testing is performed annually by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows from the business with the carrying amount of our net assets, including attributable intangible assets. The brand name acquired through the acquisition of the Travelodge Hotels Limited business was assigned a fair market value at the date of acquisition. The value of the brand name is reviewed annually for impairment. This is derived by estimating the amount of royalty income that could be generated from the brand name if it was owned by an independent third party using a royalty of 4% on forecast future revenues, which is considered to be the market value that could be achieved. The sales forecast is based on a sales forecast for the period 2023 - 27 and an estimated long term growth rate of 2%. The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. This is discounted at the weighted average cost of capital for us of 8.9%, which is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and referencing inputs from a portfolio of similar hotel businesses. We consider the value of the brand name, which was first introduced into the UK in 1985, will be maintained almost indefinitely and is therefore not amortized.

For STR data relating to the UK industry as a whole, figures for London and the regions have been summed together. As of December 2022, UK hotel room revenues have increased at a CAGR of 4.4% over the last ten years as compared to 1.6% for real UK GDP (Source: International Monetary Fund (“IMF”)). Hotel market performance is generally measured by three metrics: (1) Average room rate (“ARR”); (2) occupancy; and (3) revenue per available room (“RevPAR”). ARR represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period, measuring average room price attained by a hotel. Occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels, measuring the utilization of hotels’ available capacity. RevPAR is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by Room Nights available to guests for the period. Because RevPAR combines two key drivers of operations at hotels, ARR and occupancy, it is commonly used to measure performance over comparable periods. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The hotel brand (franchisor) typically earns fees on a room revenue basis and provides assistance with site selection, personnel training, business set-up, advertising, and product supply; and - _Managed: The hotel asset is typically owned by a third party and managed by the hotel brand which collects fees based on top and bottom line performance of the hotel. In a management agreement, the hotel brand basically provides the same services as a franchise agreement, such as brand and reservation system, but also operates the hotel.

The clientele for Luxury and Upper Upscale hotels is mixed, including both business travelers and more affluent leisure guests. Certain of these hotels may be located in seaside or other vacation destinations and may be tailored to vacation and leisure travelers. Key market participants in the Luxury and Upper Upscale segment are Four Seasons, Hilton and Marriott; - _Upscale and Upper Midscale: Upscale and Upper Midscale hotels typically offer room rates that are in the middle of the price spectrum and provide food and beverage services beyond breakfast but typically do not offer the full spectrum of services that Luxury and Upper Upscale hotels offer. Key market participants in the Upscale and Upper Midscale segment are Holiday Inn, Novotel and Britannia Hotels; and - _Midscale and Economy (“MS&E”): The MS&E segment typically offers the lowest rates per room and usually offer limited additional services, or offer services such as food and beverage at an additional cost. In 2022, the segment generated £4.9 billion of revenue from 247,062 rooms, which accounted for 36% of the total number of rooms in the UK, according to STR. The total number of demand nights in the MS&E segment was 71.1 million in 2022, according to the same source, with occupancy and ARR of 79.0% and £69.89 respectively. This translated into RevPAR of £55.41, up by 18.4% vs 2019. Occupancy, ARR and RevPAR figures for the MS&E segment have been calculated on a weighted average basis of London and the regions, weighted by revenue. Key market participants in the UK MS&E segment are the branded budget hotels Travelodge and Premier Inn, which together comprise the majority of the segment according to management estimates. The MS&E segment has proven to be highly resilient throughout economic cycles: - The MS&E segment has significantly recovered from COVID-19, with revenues increasing 19.5% from 2019 to 2022, driven by greater pricing power and higher occupancy numbers as a result of the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. ARR and occupancy figures are also higher than 2019 by 16.9% and 1.5%, respectively; - In times of economic downturn, cost conscious businesses and leisure customers trade down and MS&E hotels are able to outperform the market average, which is particularly relevant in the current inflationary environment; and ----- - The segment has also shown resilience to previous economic cycles. According to STR, during the financial crisis of 2008, RevPAR fell at a CAGR of 3.2% between 2007 and 2009 vs 4.8% for the overall UK market. For the period between 2019 and 2022, London RevPAR CAGR was 3.9% for the MS&E segment vs 2.1% for general hospitality, and UK regional RevPAR was 6.9% for the MS&E segment vs 4.6% for general hospitality.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

There was a close correlation between RevPAR and GDP, especially in the regional UK hospitality market, until the COVID-19 pandemic began, which disrupted hotel operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR. However, while it remains unclear where we stand in the current cycle, we believe that the relationship between RevPAR and GDP is likely to normalize in the future. This is in line with what happened following the 2008-2009 financial crisis where, as illustrated in the graph below titled “Long-term relationship between change in real GDP growth and UK hotel RevPar,” RevPAR and GDP growth partially decoupled (particularly in 2009), to then recover their correlation in following years. While Real GDP growth for the UK in 2023 is predicted to be 0.3% compared to 3.6% for 2022 according to the IMF, London RevPAR is forecasted to increase by 12.9% in 2023 according to STR. Such growth can be attributed to both an increase of occupancy (from 74.7% to 80.9%), and an increase in ARR (from £183.1 to £190.8), accordingly to STR data, reflecting a recovery in occupied rooms, as well as the ability of hotels to pass inflation through to their clients, to a certain extent. Regional RevPAR growth is expected to be 9.3% in 2023, which is also substantially higher than GDP growth for the UK, highlighting the present lack of correlation between the pair. At the same time, the MS&E segment is also expected to perform strongly in 2023, with London and Regional RevPAR forecasted to increase respectively by 7.2% and 3.9%. Such growth rates for the MS&E segment are partially lower vs. total market, but remain higher than expected Real GDP growth and reflect the faster 2022 recovery of the MS&E segment compared to the total market and London faster than the regions due to the slower 2022 London recovery compared to the regions. More generally, hotel market performance over the past 22 years falls broadly into four phases, in parallel with UK GDP: (I) strong growth between 2000 and 2007; (ii) a recessionary period between 2007 and 2009; (iii) an initially slow recovery in 2010 to 2012, followed by a more rapid period of growth thereafter; and (iv) the COVID-19-induced pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, followed by a sharp recovery post-COVID-19.

As can be seen from the graph above, COVID-19 had a significant impact on the hotel market and overall economy, which resulted in a mechanical drop in RevPAR in 2020 and affected most sectors of the economy: - Several strict lockdowns, especially in 2020, prevented leisure or business hotel bookings to take place as restrictions made any type of travel impossible; - Increased caution amongst the population preventing people from traveling, even when there were no lockdowns imposed; and - Repeated variants and waves forced governments to impose restrictions on international travel, reducing the amount of inbound and outbound travelers. Starting in 2021, the broader economy started to reopen. The breakout of the COVID-19 variant Omicron was contained by the successful rollout of the vaccine booster program, and the dissipation of COVID-19 and related restrictions combined with the return of regular international travel were, according to Euromonitor, the driving forces behind the recovery of the lodging market in 2022. The hotel sector was well positioned to capture the post-COVID-19 rebound, benefiting from consumers’ pent-up demand for experiences and travel once the domestic economy re-opened. Forbes also explains that an increasing number of consumers would rather spend on experiences and explore more rather than material items following COVID-19 lockdowns. Moreover, for UK residents looking to travel abroad, administrative procedures related to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, such as the need to test prior to travel, increased the popularity of “staycations” and indirectly benefited the UK lodging market. Euromonitor highlights that the increase in ARRs for self-contained accommodation due to higher demand will likely prove advantageous for hostels, budget and mid-market hotels, which represents a potential positive development for our Company. ----- The increased geopolitical and economic uncertainty observed over recent years has also resulted in increased pressure on consumer income and has dampened consumer confidence. This will affect priorities of consumers, who are more likely to stay price-conscious, creating a trade down opportunity for the MS&E segment. Similar trends have been observed in other leisure sectors (hotels, gyms, etc.) as the negative general sentiment amongst the public leads to customers trading down. Indeed, our Company’s revenues for the first 12 weeks of 2023 have been approximately 30% and 40% ahead of 2022 and 2019 levels, respectively, highlighting its resilience as well as that of the sector.

PwC Research expects that international travel to London will continue to improve, reaching 87% of pre-COVID levels at year-end 2023, which will support the recovery. The UK capital remains a key location for tourism, hosting 6 out of 20 Premier League clubs and a wealth of events and historical attractions, paired with its continued relevance for business travelers as evidenced by the ranking as 2nd global financial center in the 31st Global Financial Centre’s Index. London has bounced back strongly, as evidenced by: - 18.9% growth in ARR in 2022 compared to 2019, and occupancy at (8.7)% below 2019 levels in 2022, leading to an increase of 6.6% in RevPAR over the same timeframe; - Strong YoY recovery continued through 2022; at year end ARR, occupancy and RevPAR had grown by 50.5%, 37.1% and 199.1% vs. 2021, respectively, according to STR; - Continued growth forecasted in 2023; at year end ARR, occupancy and RevPAR to grow by 4.2%, 6.2% and 12.9% vs. 2022, respectively, according to STR; and - Forecasted growth into 2024, with levels of ARR at 24.3%, occupancy at 0.7% and RevPAR at 25.3% above 2019.

PwC Research also notes that current inflationary pressures will have differing impacts in London compared to regional UK. The London hotel landscape is more shaped by the state of international travel and exchange rates, whereas the health of UK regional hotels is more tied to that of the UK economy in general. A consumer sentiment survey conducted by PwC in September 2022 showed that an increasing number of UK consumers expected to stay in less expensive accommodations, a development which could be positive for Travelodge. However, London has seen and will to continue to experience demand from international tourists, supported by major events throughout 2023 such as England’s Six Nations rugby matches and the coronation of King Charles III. This will support future travel to London, and international visitors are expected to outnumber domestic visitors to the capital from 2023 onwards, according to STR. Business demand is also experiencing positive trends, recovering from COVID-19 and seeing increased business travel. The market is currently experiencing strong “blue collar” demand with a continued recovery of “white collar” demand over the last months, and Travelodge itself is experiencing continued growth in business customers, with positive demand drivers (such as change in working patterns) continuing to underpin potential growth in business demand.

We leased, franchised, managed and owned 595 hotels and approximately 46,000 rooms throughout the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland as of December 31, 2022. We operate in the midscale and economy (“MS&E”) segment of the hotel market (as defined by STR) and are positioned as a budget operator, offering standardized, modern guest rooms at affordable prices to both business and leisure customers. Our purpose is to provide affordable travel for everyone and we aim to offer our customers the right balance of location, price and quality for their travel needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had brand recognition of 98% among the UK population (as measured by a YouGov brand tracking survey), driven by our long-standing market presence, wide geographic network and effective marketing initiatives. We operate multiple room formats across our hotels, namely our core standard rooms (43,442 in 595 hotels as of December 31, 2022), which include twin, family and accessible rooms, and our “premium economy” SuperRooms (2,319 in 64 hotels across the United Kingdom and Ireland as of December 31, 2022). We estimate that we attracted approximately 21 million customers in 2022, well exceeding our previous pre-COVID-19 pandemic peak of approximately 19 million customers in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. We operate a lean, low-cost operating model, with a relatively small support office and a high proportion of hourly paid team members in hotels. We employ approximately 12,000 people across our hotels and support offices, the majority of whom work in our hotels on hourly paid contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 45,761 rooms in 595 hotels under the Travelodge brand. Within our largest market, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), representing 98% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 43,914 rooms (or 96% of total rooms) in 579 hotels, with 9,888 rooms (or 23% of UK rooms) in 79 hotels located in London and 34,026 rooms (or 77% of UK rooms) in 500 hotels located in regional areas across the United Kingdom. The majority of our hotels in the United Kingdom are leasehold. We also operate one hotel under a freehold and 10 hotels under management contracts in the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, 1,226 rooms in 11 hotels were operated under franchise in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including a new central Dublin City Center hotel opened in 2022, and we operated 621 rooms in five hotels under leasehold in Spain. In early 2023, we opened our first new Spanish hotel in over ten years in Madrid. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR of £909.9 million, £212.9 million and £52.59, respectively, compared to £727.9 million, £129.1 million and £42.46 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2022, our revenue, EBITDA (adjusted) and RevPAR grew at a CAGR of 7.7%, 18.2% and 7.4%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had Occupancy and an Average Room Rate of 81.8% and £64.31, respectively, compared to 80.8% and £52.51 for the year ended December 31, 2019. ----- 93% of our UK revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was generated from accommodation, with the remainder from food and beverage and retail and other sales, including Wi-Fi, car parking and other guest services. The following map indicates the number of rooms that we operated by region as of December 31, 2022: The United Kingdom has one of the largest and most resilient hotel markets in the world, with the segment having already significantly recovered from COVID-19, and RevPAR growing at a CAGR of 4.4% over the last ten years (according to STR data, compared to 1.6% for real UK GDP (Source: International Monetary Fund (“IMF”)). Historically, the performance of the UK hotel industry has been closely correlated to the strength of the UK economy and of the local regions where hotels are situated. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted hotel operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR, we believe that this will normalize in the future. Starting in 2021, the broader economy started to reopen and the breakout of the COVID-19 variant Omicron was contained by the successful rollout of the vaccine booster program. The dissipation of COVID-19 and related restrictions combined with the return of regular international travel were, according to Euromonitor, the driving forces behind the recovery of the lodging market in 2022. The hotel sector was well positioned to capture the post-COVID-19 rebound, benefiting from consumers’ pent-up demand for experiences and travel once the domestic economy re-opened. In particular, the MS&E segment has proven to be highly resilient throughout economic cycles, achieving a significant recovery from COVID-19, with revenues increasing 19.5% from 2019 to 2022. The MS&E segment is outperforming in the UK, with RevPAR growth above the total hospitality sector. Moreover, a recent consumer sentiment survey conducted by PwC in September 2022 showed that an increasing number of UK consumers expected to stay in less expensive accommodations, a development which could be positive for the MS&E segment. As such, we believe there are opportunities to grow the MS&E segment’s share of the UK market and, with a promising secured pipeline, we expect to maintain a regular program of new room openings. The UK hotel market remains relatively fragmented with a variety of local and international hotel operators and independents. We believe the fragmentation of the market presents opportunities for us to grow due to our strong brand recognition and scale. We benefit from high levels of customer satisfaction which we attribute to the quality of our offering and standardized work practices. We have made significant investments to strengthen the quality of our offering. We launched our “premium economy” room type, SuperRooms, which offers an enhanced specification, including a coffee machine, rain shower, choice of pillow and in-room hairdryer, iron and ironing board. In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of non-capital intensive ----- enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés based on market feedback from extensive customer research. The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair and an upgraded bathroom. Our new design also delivers a new style bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work. In 2022, we upgraded 64 hotels and over 6,000 rooms (approximately 14% of the room estate) with our new design, with positive commercial and customer feedback, and we plan to upgrade over 4,000 rooms (approximately 10% of the room estate) in 2023. We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle. The investments in our estate are supported by a standardized and disciplined approach to operations, a lean operating model and efficient cost control, all of which drive profitability. We operate our hotels with a standardized room cleaning process, we have processes in place to monitor our customers’ experience, we provide in-person and online training modules for our employees and we rigorously benchmark our performance by using internal customer surveys and external benchmarking, such as TripAdvisor surveys. In addition, we continue to optimize our operating model by introducing technology to simplify, standardize and automate, including our investments in robot vacuums across our estate, which has helped to reduce the physical demands of the job for our employees, reduce our energy consumption and deliver cost efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.66,Our Strengths,17.66.1,Compelling long-term growth fundamentals in the resilient and underpenetrated budget hospitality market,"The United Kingdom has one of the world’s largest and most resilient hotel markets in the world with attractive characteristics. The UK hotel industry generated approximately £20 billion in room revenue in 2022, with approximately 16,392 hotels and 679,215 hotel rooms, according to STR data. Hotel travel by domestic guests has historically benefitted from strong business investment, employment levels, wages, consumer spending and consumer confidence in the UK. The UK hotel industry also benefits from a large number of travelers coming to the United Kingdom from other countries, for business travel and tourism, including for large events. Historically, the performance of the UK hotel industry has correlated with the strength of the UK economy generally, being closely related to GDP. Although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations and impacted the relationship between GDP and RevPAR, we believe that this will normalize in the future. Nevertheless, the UK Hotel industry has been able to achieve substantial growth rates: as of December 2022, UK hotel room revenues have increased at a CAGR of 4.4% over the last ten years as compared to 1.6% for real UK GDP. The chart below shows the long-term relationship between the change in real GDP growth and UK hotel RevPAR: ----- _ Source: PwC Research November 2022 (UK Hotels Forecast 2022-2023)._ We are one of the two largest hotel brands in the UK MS&E segment, as defined by STR. Such segment has proven to be highly resilient throughout economic cycles, as in times of economic downturn, cost conscious businesses and leisure customers typically trade down and MS&E hotels are able to outperform the market average, which is particularly relevant in the current inflationary environment. RevPAR for the MS&E segment has recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic. RevPAR for the MS&E segment in 2022 was 18% above RevPAR for the UK hotel market, which had only reached 2019 levels. Our UK like-for-like RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 10.9% ahead of the MS&E segment partly due to strong leisure demand and a rapid recovery in “blue collar” demand, with a more gradual recovery in “white collar” demand. While the current macro-economic environment creates uncertainty, the budget hotel segment has proven resilient, performing well during challenging economic periods relative to other segments and we expect the segment to benefit from a number of positive demand drivers, including continued staycation demand, consumers trading down to budget hotels, changes in working patterns, events and indirectly from inbound tourism as a result of the weak Pound. We believe that the MS&E segment is more resilient during times of economic hardship than other segments, in part, because cost conscious business and leisure customers trade down during those periods. Our revenue and RevPAR increased at a CAGR of 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively, between the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2022, while our EBITDA (adjusted) increased from £129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to £212.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Alongside like-for-like RevPAR growth potential, we also believe there is further opportunity to increase the penetration of branded budget hotels in the United Kingdom. The MS&E segment of the UK hotel market accounted for approximately 37% of total hotel rooms compared to 60% in France (based on data produced by STR). As a result, we believe there are significant opportunities to grow the budget sector and the share of branded budget rooms in the United Kingdom.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We were the first budget hotel brand to launch in the United Kingdom and we had brand recognition of more than 98% among the UK population as of December 31, 2022, as measured by a YouGov brand tracking survey. Our modern hotels and standardized operational processes have allowed us to deliver high levels of customer satisfaction. As ----- of December 31, 2022, our UK hotels had an average TripAdvisor score of four dots out of five, we received 287 TripAdvisor Traveler’s Choice Awards and 89% of our UK hotels were rated four dots or higher on Trip Advisor (from 88% in 2020 and growing or remaining stable every year since). This combination of customer satisfaction and operational discipline, has helped our UK like-for-like RevPAR growth to outperform the MS&E segment since 2015. We also have significant scale in the United Kingdom. We are the second largest hotel brand in the United Kingdom based on number of hotels and number of rooms operated, with 595 hotels and 45,761 rooms as of December 31, 2022 (of which 579 hotels and 43,914 rooms specifically in the UK). Our network is highly diversified with a strong presence throughout the UK, including a large footprint in London (9,888 rooms (or 23% of UK rooms) in 79 hotels as of December 31, 2022) and the rest of our hotels spread throughout other regional areas in the United Kingdom (34,026 rooms (or 77% of UK rooms) in 500 hotels as of December 31, 2022).",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Our rooms are designed with simplicity and cleanliness in mind, with upgraded facilities contributing to a positive customer experience. In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of non-capital intensive enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés based on market feedback from extensive customer research.

We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an expected seven year cycle, with interim works in selected hotels with heavier usage patterns. We have a multi-faceted customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2022, demand and customers spread across many unrelated sectors such as leisure, blue collar and white collar, and we estimate that approximately half our customers were business guests and half were leisure guests, with blue collar customers and white collar customers accounting for approximately 30% and 20%, respectively, of our UK customer base. We have offered business memberships to our business customers since 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our bookings were made through direct bookings, including approximately 80% made through our websites and approximately 10% through walk-ins, call centers and Groups. Our leading direct distribution platform consistently delivers approximately 80% Occupancy across our hotels. We believe that large numbers of customers book directly with us due to our large-scale brand recognition, presence and simple, user-friendly website that is optimized for mobile use. We believe that our predominantly direct distribution platform gives us greater access to our customers and more control over the booking process, while reducing our overall direct marketing and commission costs. Our pricing is centrally managed by a dedicated team, which uses an optimized revenue management system. We completed a major revenue management system upgrade in 2019, which in conjunction with investments in our data and analytics capability, has enhanced our strong performance after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenue management system uses all available information to forecast demand for each hotel and to optimize prices. Our rates are updated three times per day as internal and ----- external factors change. We have a dedicated events team to monitor key events, such as large attendance concerts, sports events and cultural events, to set and adjust event specific pricing based on forecast demand.

Strong development pipeline with low upfront capex needs","We operate a lean, low-cost operating model, with a relatively small support office and a high proportion of hourly paid team members in hotels. In the United Kingdom, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, 36% of our operating costs were spent on hotel wages, 18% were spent on other property expenses, 10% were spent on cost of goods sold, including laundry and food and beverages, 10% on our central headquarters, 5% on marketing, 5% on maintenance, 3% on commission and 13% other costs) in the year ended December 31, 2022. We have implemented a range of measures to maintain the quality of our offering and reduce our costs. These measures include using predictive models to forecast occupancy at our hotels and align our employee rotas accordingly, optimizing internal processes to reduce the time it takes to complete certain tasks, training our housekeeping teams in multiple skill-sets to increase productivity and reduce personnel costs, and using a dedicated internal maintenance team to carry out routine maintenance. In addition, we have implemented new policies and technology to lower personnel costs, such as shorter hours with dedicated reception support. We also introduced robot vacuums across the estate, helping to reduce the physical demands of the job for our team members, reducing our energy consumption and delivering cost efficiencies. We have also continued to invest in automation of tasks with our Perfect Stay mobile application and energy efficiency measures in our hotels. In 2021, we brought a significant proportion of the remaining outsourced maintenance activity in-house, driving increased efficiency. We continue to selectively use outsourced services where greater service levels or opportunities to reduce costs are available, including certain complex maintenance work, certain aspects of information technology management and telephone bookings and support. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 568, or 95%, of our hotels under leases and we owned one of our hotels. The rest of our hotels are operated under management or franchise agreements. We lease almost all of our hotels through long-term arrangements with landlords, which allows us to expand our portfolio with low upfront capital expenditure, as the vast majority of the upfront construction costs of each hotel are funded by the freehold owner or developer. Development costs, which are incurred by our landlords, vary according to location and building configuration, but typically range between £80,000 and £90,000 per room excluding land (excluding certain locations such as London, where such costs are higher). New leases are normally 25 years, although properties in city centers and London are occasionally operated on terms of 35 years or longer. Most of our leases are subject to standard fiveyearly upwards-only rent reviews (some of which have upper and lower limits (“caps and collars”) on the amount the rent can increase at each review date), and are indexed against RPI or CPI, which allows for relative predictability of rental expenses. In January 2023, we completed a lease re-gear for 97 of our hotels (the “LXI Re-gear”). As part of the LXI Re-gear, rent reviews moved to a CPI + 0.5% per annum basis with caps and collars (4% per annum and 1% per annum, respectively) replacing the previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews. We expect to re-gear leases for an additional 25 hotels, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, in the second quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into agreements to lease more than 22 new hotels with more than 2,100 rooms (our “secured pipeline”) and we expect to open eight hotels and approximately 600 rooms in 2023. In the next few years, we plan to return to our normal hotel opening rate of 15 to 20 each year as market conditions improve. The overall UK rent cover for leases has increased from 0.88x in 2020 to 2.32x in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the rent cover profile (excluding central cost recharges (other than for maintenance costs) and before onerous provision releases) of our 560 UK hotels run under leases and open for at least twelve months was as follows: five hotels had rent cover of less than 1.0x (including two hotels in the Aberdeen market), 34 hotels had rent cover of 1.0x to 1.5x, 100 hotels had rent cover ----- of 1.5x to 2.0x and 421 hotels had rent cover of more than 2.0x. The majority of our leases also have favorable extension rights and the average remaining term on our UK leases, excluding renewal rights and after giving effect to the LXI Re-gear that was completed in January 2023, was approximately 18 years as of December 31, 2022. The rent reviews for the leases across our estate are staggered over a five-year period to help smooth dramatic inflation increases. As a result of our tight cost control and low upfront capital expenditures on our leasehold properties, we had an EBITDA (adjusted) Margin of 23.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022, notwithstanding subdued UK hotel market growth and significant cost increases associated with wage cost growth that exceeded inflation. Our EBITDAR (adjusted) margins have also increased from 46.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 49.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.66,Our Strengths,17.66.6,Comprehensive sustainability plan integrated into wider strategy,"We place a strong emphasis on safety and security, the environment, and our social responsibilities. Following extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, we developed a comprehensive “Better Future” sustainability plan, which was launched in 2022. The plan will help us to improve focus and performance, and to share that progress transparently with our stakeholders. We firmly believe that sustainability has a critically important role to play in shaping the future of our business. For that reason, our Better Future sustainability plan is closely aligned with our mission, to provide affordable travel for everyone and integrated with our wider business strategy. Our Better Future plan is predicated on valuing our colleagues, customers and planet, and is underpinned by three pillars: (1) _Inclusive_ _— ensuring Travelodge is accessible, inclusive, and affordable to its colleagues and customers; (2) Caring _— creating a safe and healthy environment for our colleagues and customers, and ensuring their_ wellbeing; and (3) Conscious _— being conscious of the waste we produce, the energy and resources we consume, and our carbon emissions. In line with our Better Future plan, we implemented a number of energy reduction projects in 2022. To date, we have already generated an estimated annual reduction of 24 GWh through the installation of LED lighting in most of our hotels. We also installed smart heating and cooling controls at 133 of our hotels, bringing the total across the estate to 260 hotels. These controls reduce our heating electricity consumption by approximately 45% on average per hotel. Given new technology is also important to delivering our wider business plan, we now have air to water heat pump systems installed in five new hotels and plan to replace existing electric immersion hot water systems with air to water heat pump systems in two of our existing hotels in Carlisle and Ilford in 2023. This will enable us to test and understand the challenges of retrofitting these at existing hotels and to potentially implement a wider plan of replacements of other electric immersion hot water systems within our existing estate starting in 2024. Our goal is to become a net-zero business by 2050, including measuring and reducing our indirect scope 3 emissions. As part of our Better Future plan, we intend to become a net zero operator by 2050 for our direct emissions. We plan to achieve this through a general reduction of net energy consumption by leveraging technology such as efficient LED lighting in both common areas and guestrooms, smart heating and cooling controls, solar panels and replacing old, inefficient, electrically powered boilers for hot water, with new technology such as air to water heat pumps in conjunction with the decarbonization of the national grid set in UK law. We also plan to remove our need to use gas to heat water, and substitute this with other energy producing technologies.

We have begun to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle, which we believe will enhance revenue performance and customer satisfaction. We believe we can grow our food and beverage offering by continuing to optimize our bar café performance through better aligning our offering with customer demand and by redesigning and simplifying our menu. As of December 31, 2022, we derived 36% of our food and beverage revenue from our bar café hotels. We have not advertised on television since the previous campaign ended in May 2016. We believe there is a strong strategic basis for brand building media investment to drive consideration of our brand, which will support our long-term RevPAR growth. We plan to continue to invest in numerous energy efficiency initiatives that provide long-term cost savings and support our goal to becoming a net-zero business. For example, in 2022, we installed smart temperature controls in 133 hotels and continued to benefit from the installation of smart temperature controls in 44 hotels installed in 2021. In addition, we have installed efficient LED lighting in most common areas and LED lighting is being installed in guestrooms. Under our low capital expenditure development model, when prospective hotel sites are identified, we work with the land owner and developers to agree a proposal and sign an agreement for lease. The developer then builds the hotel to our specifications and incurs the full costs of construction. Once the project is complete, we confirm that our requirements have been met. Subsequently, the developer typically sells the hotel building to a high quality institutional investor or private investor. We then begin operations and pay rent. We are typically responsible for all ongoing maintenance capital expenditure, which is primarily comprised of stamp duty and legal fees. We believe we can continue to use this model to grow our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We aim to open hotels across the United Kingdom, Spain and potentially in other countries with sustainable low-cost demand. These locations include city centers, large towns and suburban markets, year-round leisure destinations, business parks and critical transport hubs. In the next few years, we plan to return to our normal hotel opening rate of 15 to 20 each year as market conditions improve. As of December 31, 2022, we had a secured pipeline of more than 22 new hotels and more than 2,100 rooms. We expect to open eight hotels and approximately 600 rooms in 2023, and we intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our hotel portfolio beyond our secured pipeline. We have the option to expand our operations in Ireland under our master franchise agreement. In addition, we believe expansion opportunities exist in Spain under our existing development model. In the UK, we have an in-house development team, supported by external third parties, that works with local developers and landlords to identify potential opportunities for new hotels. In addition, we use independent third-party hotel consultants to identify future potential locations suitable for our hotels in the UK and Spain. As part of our expansion strategy, we are targeting another 300 potential hotel locations across the UK that would be suitable for a Travelodge hotels. Based on ----- our track record of new openings to date, we are confident that we can continue our expansion in the UK and internationally. Furthermore, while we don’t currently utilize a freehold model, we believe that a freehold model could present opportunities for growth as a largely untapped strategy, with the total capital requirement limited by the potential use of sale and leaseback transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

In early 2022, we launched a new design, transforming the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés. We aim to continue our drive to improve the consistency of our customers’ experience. Our central operations team uses regular guest feedback to identify priority areas for operational change and we develop standardized processes for key areas within the hotel that directly affect the customer experience, such as room cleaning and breakfast service. We have also deployed a standard training program for our employees at each of our hotels which focuses on customer service and problem resolution, and we offer additional management development training for hotel managers. We have also continued to invest in automation tasks with our Perfect Stay mobile application, which we upgraded in 2020, and energy efficiency measures in our hotels. In 2021, we brought a significant proportion of the remaining out-sourced maintenance activity in-house, driving increased efficiency. We continue to selectively outsource certain functions and services where greater service levels or opportunities to reduce costs are available, including certain complex maintenance work, certain aspects of information technology management and telephone bookings and support. We have implemented significant improvements to our online platform to enhance the booking experience for our business customers. These include our Travelodge Business and Travelodge Business Pay products designed with small and medium enterprises in mind but which also offer noteworthy efficiencies and benefits for larger companies. These products include a dedicated website for businesses, detailed reporting functionality to enable customers to manage their bookings and travel spend with greater ease, as well as a simplified and improved booking journey which also offers a discount on our most flexible rates. Additionally, we have partnered with a third-party provider to offer Travelodge Business Pay, an interest-free credit facility for our business customers. We aim to continue to strengthen our digital marketing activity, with targeted customer offers and buying of key search terms, appropriate digital display advertising and presence in appropriate meta-search engines. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Initially, Travelodge hotels were partnered with Little Chef restaurants, with the two frequently located on the same site, and the brand was known as Forte Travelodge. The first Travelodge hotel was opened in Barton-under-Needwood in the United Kingdom in 1985. In 2003, we began our international expansion, opening our first hotel in Spain and creating our master franchise for Ireland. In 2012, we underwent a restructuring of our operations and refinancing of our debt through a scheme of arrangement, and were acquired by the Sponsor, funds advised by Avenue Europe International Management, L.P. and sub-advised by Avenue Europe Management, LLP (“Avenue Capital”) and ELQ Investors VIII Limited, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Holdings (UK) Limited (“GS Sponsor”). In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a comprehensive recovery plan. This included new funding from the Sponsor, Avenue Capital and GS Sponsor, as well as funding from other sources, and the implementation of the CVA, which provided temporary rent reductions through the end of 2021. The CVA completed on January 19, 2023. The Sponsor acquired all the equity interests held by Avenue Capital and GS Sponsor in December 2022 and March 2023, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that we attracted approximately 21 million customers over our portfolio of 595 hotels in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We operate multiple room formats across our hotels, namely our core standard rooms (43,442 in 595 hotels as of December 31, 2022), which include twin, family and accessible rooms, and our “premium economy” SuperRooms (2,319 in 64 hotels across the United Kingdom and Ireland as of December 31, 2022). In early 2022, we launched a new design, which includes a series of non-capital intensive enhancements to transform the look and feel of our hotels, rooms and bar cafés based on market feedback from extensive customer research. The new design seeks to drive higher demand and rate premiums by delivering a warmer and more welcoming environment with updated room features, including blackout curtains, USB charging points by the bed, a comfortable armchair in which to relax and an upgraded bathroom. Our new design also delivers a new style bar café in our bar café hotels, offering a more flexible environment in which to eat, relax or work. In 2022, we upgraded 64 hotels and over 6,000 rooms (approximately 14% of the room estate) with our new design, with positive commercial and customer feedback, and we plan to upgrade over 4,000 rooms (approximately 10% of the room estate) in 2023. We plan to refurbish our entire estate over an approximately seven-year refit cycle. In addition, we continue to optimize our operating model by introducing technology to simplify, standardize and automate, including our investments in robot vacuums across our estate, which has helped to reduce the physical demands of the job for our team members, lower our energy consumption and deliver cost efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

As of December 31, 2022, we operated 579 hotels with 43,914 rooms (or 96% of our total rooms) in the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland). Our hotels offer our customers standardized and comfortable en-suite guest rooms which provide a clean look and feel. Typically, our rooms are between 15 and 21 square meters in size and contain our king-size Travelodge “Dreamer” bed. Larger rooms provide guests with one or two additional pull-out beds, depending on the size of the room. Each room has our branded curtains, artwork and bed runner and offers open hanging and shelf storage space. Additionally, rooms contain a flat screen TV. Our rooms are furnished with one or two chairs, depending on the room size, a desk and a panel heater or ----- radiator. Each room is equipped with a shower, and many also have baths. Free shower gel and hand soap are provided. In 2017, we launched our “premium economy” room type, SuperRooms, which offers additional features, including a coffee machine, rain shower and choice of pillow, as well as inroom hairdryer, iron and ironing board. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 2,319 SuperRooms in 64 hotels across the United Kingdom and Ireland.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.69,Principal Business Activities,17.69.3,Hotel Clusters,"We categorize our hotels into five clusters: - London: hotels located in Central London and Greater London. - Provincial/regional: hotels in the United Kingdom outside of London. - Spain: hotels we operate in Spain. - Ireland: hotels operated under our franchise model in Ireland. - Management contracts: hotels owned by independent landlords but operated by us under management contracts. Below is a discussion of our hotel portfolio by cluster. _London_ As of December 31, 2022, we had 79 hotels with 9,888 rooms in London, representing 23% of our total hotel offering in the United Kingdom by number of rooms. Our London hotels are located throughout the city, with a high concentration in the city center and an even distribution throughout the suburbs. Generally, each London hotel has more than 100 rooms, with a bar café and limited or no parking facilities in central London and greater parking provision in greater London. Our London hotels generated £270.7 million of revenue (29.8% of our total revenue) and £98.0 million of EBITDA (adjusted) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The average occupancy rate in our London hotels over the same period was 84.5%, and the average rate charged per room was £84.96, giving a RevPAR of £71.77. _Regional_ As of December 31, 2022, we had 500 hotels with 34,026 rooms located outside of London and across the United Kingdom, representing 77% of our total UK hotel offering. Generally, each regional hotel has more than 65 rooms and a parking lot. As of December 31, 2022, 32% of our regional hotels had a bar café. Our regional hotels, excluding those operated under management contract, generated £622.2 million of revenue (68.3% of total revenue) and £176.3 million of EBITDA (adjusted) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The average occupancy rate in these hotels over the same period was 80.9%, and the average rate charged per room was £58.24, giving a RevPAR of £47.13. ----- Of the 500 hotels located in regional areas, we operate 10 under management contracts and own one, as of December 31, 2022. The remaining 489 hotels are operated under leases. See “—Management _Contracts.” Spain_ As of December 31, 2022, we operated five hotels with 621 rooms in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia, Spain. In early 2023, we opened a new hotel in Madrid, which was the first opening in Spain in over ten years. We also have an office in Madrid which provides local operational support and financial control. Our Spanish hotels generated £14.7 million of revenue and £3.2 million of EBITDA (adjusted) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The average occupancy rate in the hotels over the same period was 84.1%, and the average rate charged per room was €81.42, giving a RevPAR of €68.48. _Ireland_ As of December 31, 2022, we had 11 Travelodge hotels with 1,226 rooms in operation in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland pursuant to a franchise agreement with Smorgs ROI Management Limited, as franchisee (“Smorgs”), and guaranteed by a large hotel management company in Ireland. The franchise agreement was entered into in 2016 for a term to 2034. We receive income through monthly franchise fees from Smorgs, equal to £1.6 million of EBITDA (adjusted) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. An additional booking fee is payable for each customer. Five hotels with 802 rooms are located in Dublin, and the rest of the hotels are in Belfast, Cork, Derry, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. _Management Contracts_ As of December 31, 2022, we operated ten hotels in the United Kingdom under management contracts pursuant to which we operate the hotels but do not hold a leasehold interest in the properties. These management agreements arose because the ten sites in question were sites which we considered would not be commercially viable for us to operate with a full leasehold interest, but which could be successfully run using shorter-term, lower-cost management agreements. Eight of these hotels are roadside sites which are operated under management agreements with Moto Hospitality Limited, four of which are due to expire in 2027 and four of which are due to expire in 2031. The remaining two sites are operated under management agreements with various third parties, which will expire in 2023 and 2029, respectively. We are currently negotiating extensions for these management agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Most of our bar cafés also serve lunch and dinner. Our menu offering includes a range of popular meals, including freshlymade and authentic stone-baked pizza, salads, burgers and desserts. We also offer value-driven “meal deals” and a children’s dinner menu.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.69,Principal Business Activities,17.69.5,Operating Models,"Most of our Travelodge hotels are operated under two types of operating models. The vast majority of our hotels in the United Kingdom and Spain are operated by us under a leasehold model, while our Irish hotels are operated under a franchise agreement with Smorgs. In addition, we operate one hotel under a freehold model and ten hotels under management contracts. ----- _Leasehold Model_ As of December 31, 2022, we held leases for 568 hotels in the United Kingdom and five hotels in Spain. As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the LXI Re-gear, the average remaining term on our leases, excluding renewal rights, was 17.7 years in the United Kingdom and 9.9 years in Spain. Most of our leases are standard triple net leases with typical commercial terms and an average term of 25 years (although properties in city centers and London are occasionally operated on terms of 35 years or longer). Most of our leases are subject to standard, five-yearly and upwards-only rent reviews, indexed against the RPI, RPIX or CPI, while only a small number of our leases are subject to open market rent reviews. Some of these leases have caps and collars, usually at 1% and 4%, respectively. Three of our leases are subject to annual, upwards-only rent reviews indexed against the RPI. Under most of these leases, we have a contractual or statutory right to renew beyond the initial term, usually for a further 25 years. By leasing our properties, we avoid many of the high costs associated with the acquisition and development of the land on which our properties are situated, and we incur lower upfront capital expenditure costs. _LXI Re-gear_ In December 2022, we announced an agreement with LXI REIT plc (the “LXI Re-gear”), the Group’s largest landlord, for a lease re-gear on 122 hotels, which they acquired as part of their acquisition of Secure Income REIT in July 2022. In January 2023, we completed the LXI Re-gear for 97 of our hotels. We expect to re-gear leases for an additional 25 hotels, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, in the second quarter of 2023. As part of the LXI Re-gear, rent reviews moved to a CPI + 0.5% per annum basis with caps and collars (4% per annum and 1% per annum, respectively) replacing the previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews. The unexpired lease terms on 97 hotels were extended by a weighted average of nine years, and the parties agreed to a “rent-smoothing” of the hotels on a site-by-site basis to ensure that each hotel has a robust stand-alone Rent Cover. We also took the opportunity to agree “green lease” provisions, including sharing of energy, water, recycling and waste data and cooperation on the environmental, social and governance strategies of the landlord and tenant. _Franchise Model_ All of our Irish hotels are operated under a master franchise agreement with Smorgs, and guaranteed by a large hotel management company in Ireland. The agreement expires in 2034 and requires Smorgs to pay a franchise fee, as well as a booking fee per customer reservation, and to comply with certain operational requirements. Smorgs receives brand, revenue management and operational guidance from us, and has the benefit of certain guarantees which we provide to landlords. As part of our strategy to expand our hotel portfolio, we may consider adapting this master franchise agreement such that it can be used in new jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.69,Principal Business Activities,17.69.6,Price Management,"We set the prices for all our hotels centrally, using a dedicated pricing and revenue management team. This team determines our pricing strategy by hotel according to product quality, demand and competition. Our pricing strategy is supported by our revenue management system, which uses data analysis to forecast occupancy, optimize prices using information such as our rate of sale and our competitors’ rates. Our centralized revenue management team, consisting of approximately 30 people, processes the information provided by our revenue management system and adjusts the price points for each hotel individually to optimize RevPAR. We completed a major revenue management system upgrade in 2019, which in conjunction with investments in our data and analytics capability, has enhanced our strong performance after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our rates are updated up to 3 times ----- per day as internal and external factors change. We have a dedicated events team to monitor key events, such as large attendance concerts, sports events and cultural events, to set and adjust event specific pricing based on forecast demand. Our centralized team uses high-quality reporting, benchmarking and data analytics to monitor performance and adjust pricing in real time to further optimize the prices charged. Our RGI grew from 92 in January 2020 to 103 in December 2022, which indicates that our growth outpaced the growth of the market during this period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We use one of the following three strategies in developing new hotels: - We enter into partnerships with a range of landlords and developers including major institutions and property companies as well as local developers and high net worth individuals who are specialists in their local area. Travelodge determines the build specifications and we enter into an agreement for a lease with the landlord, which grants the lease once development works are completed. This is the most common type of acquisition that we carry out. Usually, the agreement for a lease is conditional upon factors such as site acquisition, financing, vacant possession, and the granting of planning permission. Under this type of development, the majority of the capital spend is for the account of the developer but internal costs, such as fees and stamp duty, are monitored and regularly reported by our finance team; - We enter into a forward-funded development whereby Travelodge carries out the development works, funded by a third party; or - We acquire hotels by purchasing going concerns. In these circumstances, the terms of the purchase vary greatly from deal to deal. However, in general, the transaction is structured so that we enter into an agreement with the estate owner and/or the landlord and any existing operator. In this scenario, we acquire certain elements of the business and assets of the existing operator and a leasehold interest in the hotel. We then subsequently re-brand and refurbish the hotel as a Travelodge hotel. - We from time-to-time close certain of our individual hotels. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we closed three, four and 19 hotels, respectively. The comparatively large amount of hotel closures in 2020 was the result of the implementation of the CVA during the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.71,New Properties,17.71.1,,"_Developed Properties_ When deciding on new sites, we review the demographics, business and employment data of proposed locations. We also review existing and proposed transportation links, the importance of the proposed site for national and international tourism and the proximity to universities, hospitals and military bases. Based on this approach, we have identified a significant number of viable sites for further consideration, some of which are in our current pipeline. _Pipeline Developments_ As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into agreements to operate upwards of 22 new hotels with more than 2,100 rooms (our “secured pipeline”), of which we expect to open eight hotels in 2023. We currently envisage spending approximately £5 million on development costs in 2023 in light of new ----- hotel openings. In the next few years, we plan to return to our normal hotel opening rate of 15 to 20 each year as market conditions improve. We develop our secured pipeline through a network of employed and freelance development managers who search for opportunities. Once an eligible project has been identified on the basis of our investment model, our development managers enter into initial discussions with the developers and begin to record and monitor the development project in our database. As the discussions advance, we enter into term sheets which set out the basic principles of a potential development, and relevant committee approvals and planning permissions are sought. When certain conditions are satisfied, we execute a formal lease agreement and the property becomes part of our “secured pipeline.” A few conditions remain until the project is classified unconditional. The developer then builds the property to our specification using its own funds. Our costs are typically limited to certain advisory and planning fees. _List of Newly-Opened UK Leased Hotels_ Below is a table showing the location, rooms and opening date of all hotels opened since January 1, 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We also have a Data Protection Officer to arbitrate on behalf of our customers and employees. We believe this is important, despite not being a legal requirement following a change of guidance in 2022, because it offers impartial protection to our customers and staff should data incidents arise. We only collect and maintain sensitive personal information data where it is strictly necessary for protection of life, such as for health and safety reasons, to maintain good employment practices or for other lawful reasons. Such usages are subject to mandatory privacy assessment. We originally selected the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Controls Framework to start benchmarking our cyber security and drive the cyber security maturity of the organization. This was done via self-assessment and has served the organization well in getting our maturity to the level it currently is, on a par with our industry peers. We have recently transitioned our Information Security audit framework from the CIS framework to the globally recognized National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) CyberSecurity Framework. From 2023, this NIST control framework will be externally audited by a specialist agency to provide wider assurance and consistency. This transition reflects the progress we have made in previous years and will enable our security and compliance programs to stay aligned with industry best practices moving forward.

The majority of employees are employed on hourly contracts, with flexible working hours. We offer the over 23 year old National Living Wage to staff of all ages. Since April 6, 2017, we are required to pay an apprenticeship levy of 0.5% on our wages bill to help fund training for apprenticeships in the United Kingdom. The majority of employees are employed within the hotels.

Following extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, we developed a comprehensive sustainability plan, “Better Future,” designed to mark a step-change in our sustainability agenda. The plan will help us to both improve focus and performance, and to share that progress transparently with our stakeholders. We firmly believe that sustainability has a critically important role to play in shaping the future of our business. For that reason, our sustainability plan “Better Future” is closely aligned with our goal of providing affordable travel for everyone and integrated with our wider business strategy. _Our “Better Future” sustainability plan_ Valuing our employees, customers and planet is the vision that underpins the three pillars of our sustainability plan. 1. _Inclusive: Ensuring Travelodge is accessible, inclusive, and affordable to its employees and customers. 2. _Caring: Creating a safe and healthy environment for our employees and customers, and ensuring their wellbeing. 3. _Conscious: Being conscious of the waste we produce, the energy and resources we consume, and our carbon emissions. ----- _Diversity_ We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace, one which provides opportunities to learn more and earn more and one where everyone can be their true self and belong. We attach great importance to our inclusion of a diverse range of people throughout all areas of our business We monitor the diversity of our existing workforce in order to uphold a culture of equality, diversity and inclusion. We have both an equality and diversity policy and a trans inclusion policy in place. We use our diversity data to understand the makeup of our workforce and whether it is representative of both the wider UK society and geographical areas. This helps us to focus our attention on the areas where improvement is needed and create action plans to address these. Our focus on equality and diversity has helped us to reach a position where around 63% of our hotel managers are women. We are ahead of the new target of 40% female representation for diversity in senior leadership roles, as set out by the Hampton-Alexander review for FTSE 350 companies. 48% of our Senior Leadership team are women, as are 57% of our operating board, however, we continue to have targets in place to remain focused on gender balance. We operate a number of equality and diversity groups covering topics such as gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability. Each group has an operating board sponsor as well as members from the senior leadership team. The groups were formed in 2022, recognizing that a successful ED&I agenda must be driven by the most senior people in the company. _Environmental_ Our goal is to become a net-zero business by 2050, including measuring and reducing our indirect scope 3 emissions. Having now agreed our plan for direct scope 1 and 2 emissions and the process to understand indirect scope 3 emissions, in the coming year we will set out to deliver this plan to target. This will include the continued installation of smart heating and cooling controls within our hotels, testing the ability to retrofit air source heat pump technology into a trial set of hotels and revising our new build and refurbishment specifications to reflect the strategic importance of sustainability. We also expect to conclude the initial measurement of our indirect scope 3 emissions. Through the implementation of this plan, we expect to meet our target to reduce our electricity consumption by 13% by the end of 2023, compared with a 2017 baseline. ----- The UK government has set in law that the UK will be net-zero by 2050, and we expect that legislation will evolve in the coming decades to require businesses and individuals/consumers to move away from gas consumption. For example, by 2025, all new homes will be banned from installing gas and oil boilers and will instead be heated by low-carbon alternatives. We intend to assess our indirect scope 3 emissions during 2023 and to submit or consolidate direct and indirect plans by the end of 2023. Our direct carbon footprint for 2022 was 41,270 tons (2021: 39,922 tons) of carbon dioxide and equivalent gases (CO2e), with an intensity of 45.4 tons (2021: 71.3 tons) of CO2e per million pound of turnover and 3.1 tons (2021: 4.0 tons) of CO2e per 1,000 nights sold. Although overall we used 10% more energy in 2022 versus 2021, our intensity metrics decreased because: - we have continued to roll out smart heating cooling controls during 2022 to 133 hotels and benefited from the annualization of a further 44 hotels completed in 2021; - generally, 2022 was a warmer year than 2021, requiring less energy to heat our hotels, particularly in quarter one and four; and - we were more occupied in our hotels and had more sleepers staying with us, which inherently keeps our hotels warmer and therefore requires less energy to maintain similar heating levels. We have reported on all of the emission sources which we deem ourselves to be responsible for, as required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors Report) Regulations 2013. These sources fall within our operations control and financial boundaries and include emissions from manufacturing, retail and distribution sites and the operation of our distribution fleet.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The methodology used to calculate our emissions is based on the UK Government’s Environmental Reporting Guidance (2013), the GHG Protocol (2004) and is in line with the methods used previously for reporting under ESOS and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. Emissions factors are taken from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (2022 & 2021).

In some cases hot water is also heated via electric boilers, although the majority uses gas. As part of our Better Future Plan, we intend to make Travelodge a net zero operator by 2050 for our direct emissions. We expect to achieve this through a general reduction of net energy consumption through to 2030 by leveraging technology such as: - efficient LED lighting in both common areas and guestrooms; - smart heating and cooling controls; - solar panels; and - replacing old, inefficient, electrically powered boilers for hot water, with new technology such as air to water heat pumps. By 2030, we expect that we will be able to achieve a reduction in annual energy usage of around 65 GWh (32% of our 2017 energy use) across all of our existing hotels. This is an average across all of our existing hotels and will vary by hotel depending on age and condition. To date, we have already generated an estimated annual reduction of 24 GWh through the installation of LED lighting at most of our hotels and smart heating and cooling controls at 260 of our hotels by the end of 2022. By 2050, we aspire to also transition away from the use of gas to heat hot water and transition to new technology, with a current option being air to water heat pumps. As a leaseholder, we recognize the challenge of achieving this across approximately 500 sites where gas is used, given the significant estimated cost of doing so (estimated approximately £70 million). We will work closely with our landlords to ensure we deliver an optimal outcome to all parties. The above plan, implemented in accordance with the full decarbonization of the UK grid by 2050 as set out in law by the Climate Change Act, would achieve a balanced outcome for our direct emissions by reducing our existing electricity consumption, benefiting from a decarbonized national grid and seeking to transition our gas consumption to more efficient technology. We also aim to reduce our indirect scope 3 emissions and we will work with our supplier to drive their own decarbonization. We recognize that the transition to net zero is fraught with economic, political, technological, and social complexities. We will continually review our plan as we progress towards a low carbon economy and we will support wider climate action as we do so, such as carbon offsetting where appropriate. In addition to developing our plan, we continued to deliver other energy reduction projects through the year. We installed smart heating and cooling controls at 133 of our hotels in 2022, bringing the total to 260 hotels. Reviews during the year continued to validate that installing these controls reduces our heating electricity consumption by around 45%. Given new technology is also important to delivering our wider business plan, we now have air to water heat pump based hot water systems installed at five new hotels and plan to replace existing electric immersion hot water systems with air to water heat pump based systems in two of our existing hotels in Carlisle and Ilford in 2023. This will enable us to test and understand the challenges of retrofitting these at existing hotels and be ready for a wider rolling plan of replacements of other electric immersion hot water systems within our existing estate from 2024. _Adapting to Climate Change_ We set a target to understand how climate change will affect our business, customers and supply chain. In 2022, we partnered with a climate risk consultant and started a project to identify the climate related risks and opportunities which may impact us under different future states. To future-proof our business ----- against the impacts of climate change, we are identifying and assessing a range of climate-related risks relevant to our business. These are categorized as either physical risks; resulting from weather and climate factors such as rainfall and temperature rise, or transition risks; arising from a failure to meet key expectations of businesses in a low-carbon economy. Due to the uncertainty of what the future holds, we are examining these risks under two distinct scenarios; one following the assumption that businesses continue as usual and global warming continues to increase unchecked, and a second scenario where businesses effectively transition toward a low-carbon economy on a global scale, thus limiting global temperature increase. We expect to complete this project in 2023. This will also ensure Travelodge adheres to the requirements of the Task Force for Climate Related Disclosures. _Responsible sourcing & supply chain management_ Procurement plays a crucial role in executing sustainability strategies as it orchestrates where and how a company spends and can therefore ensure that business with suppliers is conducted in a manner that aligns to certain environmental, social and ethical standards. Procurement can leverage responsible sourcing activities to identify and correct supply chain risks and encourage suppliers to limit environmental impacts. Sourcing risks include labor exploitation, environmental pollution and unsafe working conditions. Responsible sourcing will be a key element of development within our procurement processes and allow Travelodge to incorporate ethical, sustainable and socially conscious principles into sourcing, procurement and its overall supply chain management practices. Last year we targeted 15 business critical suppliers and conducted a sustainability assessment of their businesses using a bespoke questionnaire; developed jointly with Simply Sustainable. This included questions such as the current position and any targets covering carbon footprints across all three scopes, inclusivity and diversity as well as health and safety and information security. _Inclusion_ As part of developing our Better Future plan, we recruited a wellbeing and inclusion manager in 2022 to focus specifically on delivering our inclusion calendar of events. Listening groups were held with employees such as our LGBTQ+ community to understand what else we could do in order for them to feel they belong. Suggestions from the group helped to inform activities throughout the year such as the creation of pride packs. In 2022, we created seven senior leadership groups who will work together to sponsor and champion our inclusion agenda in the coming years for categories such as gender and ethnic diversity, emotional and physical health, and disability. In our 2022 annual employee satisfaction survey, Your Voice, for the first time we included a question asking whether our employees feel Travelodge is a place where everyone can belong. For our 2022 survey results, the company score was 8.0 out of 10, which we believe is a positive reflection of the work we are doing to educate and celebrate the diversity and inclusion of employees in our business. We aim to maintain this score while increasing participation in our survey. _Customer accessibility_ We recognize the wide range of customers that use our premises and aim to make our hotels accessible and welcoming to everyone. There are currently 2,367 accessible rooms (5% of all rooms) within our portfolio, and we plan to continue this ratio in our new hotels. In 2022, we partnered with Disability Positive, who have helped us review policies and procedures, the equipment used at our hotels and the way we train our employees. In consultation with Disability Positive we revised our Disability Awareness training which was rolled out to all staff in 2022, we updated our online booking process to allow guests booking accessible rooms to state whether they wanted the room set up as a twin or double room, guests booking accessible rooms can now also provide details of any assistance they might require to evacuate a building, search on the Travelodge website ----- for hotels with accessible wet rooms, revised the internal signage to be more pictorial and user friendly and developed a new headboard design for accessible rooms the accommodates both the twin room and double room setup without compromising the customer experience. We hold research groups as required to hear first-hand from our customers what their needs are, so these can be incorporated into both our service offering and our policies. We aim to make our website accessible to all users, including people with disabilities. To achieve this, our UK website has been developed in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 where possible. These guidelines have been published by the World Wide Web Consortium to promote accessibility. _Wellbeing_ The physical, emotional, financial and work wellbeing of our employees is important to us. Our specially curated platform Better Me, provides resources to all employees to support four key pillars of wellbeing: In 2022, we launched “Better Me Moments” — creating a moment in time where as an individual or as a team, you do something to focus on one of the four pillars. Examples of Better Me Moments include team step challenges and mindfulness sessions. Our Employee Assistance Program provides an online and twenty-four hour telephone helpline for any employee and members of their family needing support. Their service covers three of our core areas of wellbeing: financial, emotional and physical. Legal professionals can provide support on a range of financial issues. Employees and their family members can benefit from up to six free face-to-face counseling sessions to support mental health issues from depression to relationship problems, and registered nurses can assist with physical wellbeing. In 2022, we ran a number of internal campaigns focusing on different aspects of wellbeing including Mental Health Awareness month, Men’s Health Awareness month, World Menopause day, Travelodge Health MOT and National Pensions Awareness week. All our campaigns involve employees within our business and our aim is to educate, encourage conversations about topics which have historically been taboo, and provide self-serve resources for those that need them. We will continue to build and evolve Better Me in 2023 and in future years. Our annual “Your Voice” survey monitors whether employees feel that there are resources available to them at Travelodge to support their wellbeing. For our 2022 survey we achieved an overall company score of 7.7, a 0.3 percentage point improvement from 2021. Our head office employees scored 8.2 and we intend to improve our score. ----- _Charity partnerships_ Travelodge has partnered with the British Heart Foundation since 2017 and plans to continue the relationship during 2023. In November 2022, at the BHF Heart Heroes Awards, Travelodge was recognized, as one of three companies, for their extraordinary work in the development and promotion of the BHF’s new CPR training tool, RevivR. RevivR is accessible on your smartphone and teaches you how to administer CPR using only your phone and a pillow, removing the need for a traditional CPR dummy. In 2022, through our partnership we helped train over a 1,000 people, both our customers and employees, to complete this life-saving skill, through RevivR. We have placed a QR code sticker in every one of our approximately 45,000 rooms which will link you directly to the RevivR training. We also continued to work with Pennies during 2022, giving customers the opportunity to add a few pennies to their hotel room bookings, for charity. Customers have raised over £1 million pounds so far by using this digital charity box.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We regularly train our employees on our comprehensive range of safety and security policies and procedures. Refresher training is provided on a quarterly, six-monthly or annual basis depending upon the topic. Health and safety related training is provided through a combination of formats including elearning, face to face, workshops and one to one sessions. Training is regularly reviewed by the Health and Safety Team, and where appropriate external advisors, to ensure it remains fresh and up to date with changes in legislation and industry best practice. In addition, we have a nominated _“Safety Champion” in every operational district to support hotel teams. Our Safety Champions are operational employees, usually a member of the management team or an experienced senior employee from within the operational district they represent, who can provide support and coaching on health and safety matters to others within the district. Our hotels are audited twice a year by a global independent expert public health organization, to ensure they are following Travelodge’s comprehensive safety procedures and complying with all relevant health and safety, food safety and fire safety regulations. In 2022, the hotel health and safety audit pass rate was 98%, this was the third successive year achieving a pass rate above 96%. Our hotels are also subject to routine inspections from local authority Environmental Health Officers, Fire Safety Officers and officers from other various enforcement agencies. Our internal team actively monitors our audit, enforcement and accident and incident data, ensuring that all information is analyzed, and improvements are made where possible. This helps us to prevent recurrence and reduces risk to our customers and employees. One or more Board Directors who are also operating board members as well as at least one additional operating board member attend the monthly Safety, Security & Risk committee. The committee ensures the risks we face are understood, managed and monitored into the future and while this covers all risks, it will focus on those which are more likely or more severe should they happen, such as the risk of fire or a cyber-attack. It will also review new and emerging risks, such as the potential for energy blackouts at the end of 2022. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Anchor Holdings is controlled by a general partner, which is in turn controlled by entities managed and/or advised by GoldenTree Asset Management. The general partner is entitled to direct the ordinary course and strategic affairs of Anchor Holdings; however, certain matters are reserved by Luxembourg law for approval by holders of the ordinary voting shares of Anchor Holdings, such as approval of distributions and liquidation, subject to certain approval thresholds pursuant to the securityholders’ deed relating to Anchor Holdings and its general partner. As the management’s equity interests received pursuant to the management equity incentive plan are ordinary voting shares of Anchor Holdings, management has the same voting rights as all other holders of ordinary voting shares of Anchor Holdings. See “Principal Shareholders.” Management’s equity interests under this plan entitle them to receive distributions upon a sale in which they participate or other disposition of the assets of Anchor Holdings that results in distributions to the equityholders. Any such entitlements are subject to the achievement of certain thresholds based on total returns received by equity holders. As a result, the amounts which our management will realize in respect of their equity interests under the plan largely depend on our results in the future and our ability to effect a strategic transaction at an attractive value.

The Euro Notes Interest Amount will be calculated_ by applying the Euro Notes Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Euro Notes outstanding on the Determination Date, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of Euro Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Euro Notes Applicable Rate and the Euro Notes Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Euro Notes: “Determination Date” means, with respect to the Euro Notes, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period (as defined below) in respect of the relevant Interest ----- Period, except (x) in respect of the first Interest Period, for which the Determination Date will be the Issue Date and (y) in the event that EURIBOR is not available for any Interest Period (or portion thereof) as may be required to calculate the interest payable in order to redeem any or all Euro Notes in respect of any notice of redemption delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to use the Determination Date for the prior Interest Period (as notified by the Issuer to the Trustee, Paying Agent, Calculation Agent and the Holders in such redemption notice); _provided that if the redemption date is delayed requiring the Issuer to update the notice of redemption, the Issuer will also reset the Determination Date in accordance with this definition; “EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR1 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR1 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Euro Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with the Calculation Agent, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Euro Notes; _provided, further, that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases_ never be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of such alternative basis. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture will be deemed to refer to such alternative basis; “euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro; “Interest Period” means, with respect to the Euro Notes, the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude     , 2023; “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time; “Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF” or such ----- other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor); and “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein. Each of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. As of December 31, 2022, the Guarantors held 98.3% of our total consolidated assets (excluding brand intangible assets, deferred tax assets and net consolidation adjustments due to the adoption of IFRS 16). For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors generated 98.4% and 98.5% of our revenues and EBITDA (adjusted), respectively. In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case of the ----- Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Notes _Guarantees—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Notes Guarantees— Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult, and insolvency laws of England and Wales may not be as favorable to you as U.S. and other insolvency laws with which you may be more familiar and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or under the Security Documents.”_ All or substantially all of the operations of the Company will be conducted through its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) and, therefore, the Company depends on the cash flow from its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under its Notes Guarantee. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new GBP Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof and each such new Euro Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured ----- Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to these “Change of Control” provisions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Notes Guarantees—The Issuer may not be able to _repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_ In addition, if an event that constitutes a Change of Control occurs, the definitions of “Change of _Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a_ transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; (10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; (11) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or ----- Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (12) Solely with respect to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if 100% of LTM EBITDA of the Company (the “grower permission”) exceeds £213.0 million (the “numerical _permission”) at any time, the numerical permission of clause (1) of the second paragraph of this_ covenant shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness,” (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, and, if applicable, the Proceeds Loan, on substantially identical terms; _provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

If the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Company, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitments (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Senior Secured Notes or other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such other Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Company or Restricted Subsidiary shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes) pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes); (2) purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase; (3) invest in any Replacement Assets; (4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (5) make a capital expenditure; ----- (6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar Business; (7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or (8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary that is within the Asset Disposition ----- Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer _Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period_ (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to GBP Notes, and €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to Euro Notes. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new GBP Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of £100,000 and each such new Euro Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after any Officer becoming aware thereof, written notice of any events of which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. ----- The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or the common depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.” Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

However, where the interest is paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax, the interest will not be assessed to United Kingdom tax in the hands of a holder of the Notes (other than certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except where the holder of the Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom, in connection with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the United Kingdom branch or agency, or permanent establishment. Holders of the Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the ----- person entitled to the relevant interest and premium to UK tax. However, exemption from, or reduction of, such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty. _Provision of Information_ Persons in the United Kingdom (i) paying interest to or receiving interest on behalf of another person who is an individual or (ii) paying amounts due on redemption of the Notes which constitute deeply discounted securities as defined in Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (“ITTOIA”) to or receiving such amounts on behalf of another person who is an individual may be required to provide certain information to HMRC regarding the identity of the payee or person entitled to the interest (including in certain cases, the name and address of the beneficial owner of interest or the amount payable on redemption of Notes, as applicable), and in certain circumstances, such information may be exchanged with tax authorities in other countries. _UK Corporation Tax Payers_ In general, holders of Notes which are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax (including non-resident holders whose Notes are used, held or acquired for the purpose of a trade carried on in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment) will be charged to tax as income on all returns, profits or gains on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment. _Other Holders of the Notes Taxation of Interest_ Holders of Notes who are either individuals or trustees and are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable will generally be liable to United Kingdom income tax on the amount of any interest received in respect of the Notes. _Taxation of Chargeable Gains_ The Notes should constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” within the meaning of Section 117 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, with the result that on a disposal of the Notes neither chargeable gains nor allowable losses should arise for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. If the Notes fall outside the definition of “qualifying corporate bond,” any disposal of a Note by an individual holder who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Note is attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of United Kingdom tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances. _Accrued Income Profits_ On a disposal of Notes by a holder of the Notes, any interest that has accrued since the last interest payment date may be chargeable to tax as income under the rules relating to accrued income profits as set out in Part 12 of the ITA if that holder of the Notes is resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. These provisions will not apply if the Notes are deemed to be “deeply discounted securities” (as to which, please see “Taxation of Discount” below). _Taxation of Discount_ Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued, or, in certain cases, the premium (if any) payable on redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the ITTOIA. If Notes are deemed to ----- constitute deeply discounted securities, individual holders of the Notes who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable generally will be liable to United Kingdom income tax on any gain realized on the sale or other disposal (including redemption) of the Notes, however such holders will not be able to claim relief from United Kingdom income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption of, or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption of, the Notes. Holders of Notes are advised to consult their own professional advisers if they require any advice or further information relating to “deeply discounted securities.” _Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_ No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue of or on a transfer of, or on an agreement to transfer, the Notes provided that (i) the interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the Notes and (ii) any right on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the Notes is reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. The Issuer's expectation is that these conditions should be satisfied in respect of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

They are based on the Issuer’s understanding of current United Kingdom tax law as applied in England and Wales and HMRC published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC) relating only to certain aspects of United Kingdom taxation, both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. The comments do not address the consequences of any substitution of the Issuer or further issues of securities that will form a single series with the Notes (notwithstanding that such substitution or further issue may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the Notes). The comments below do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any person other than holders of the Notes. The references to “interest”, “premium” and “discount” below are to “interest”, “premium” and “discount” as understood for the purposes of United Kingdom tax law. They do not take into account any different definitions of “interest”, “premium” and “discount” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related document. ----- The comments below relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and any interest payable on their Notes and who hold Notes as a capital investment. Certain classes of persons (such as brokers, dealers in securities, market makers, depositaries, clearance services, certain professional investors, persons connected with the Issuer or persons who acquire (or are deemed to acquire) Notes by reason of an office or employment) may be subject to special rules and the comments below do not apply to such holders of Notes. The UK tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. The comments below do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice and any prospective holders of the Notes who are subject to tax in any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, or who are in any doubt as to their tax position, should consult an appropriate professional adviser.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.2,Characterization of the Notes,"Under certain circumstances (for example, “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the Notes provide for payments in excess of stated interest and principal and/or redemption prior to their stated maturity. The Issuer intends to take the position that these provisions will not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules of applicable Treasury Regulations (the “CPDI Rules”). This position is based in part on assumptions that, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a “remote” or “incidental” contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. The Issuer’s determination that this contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s position is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged the Issuer’s position, the tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes could be materially different than those described herein, including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes are not subject to the CPDI Rules, but there can be no assurances in this regard. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the CPDI Rules and the consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.3,Payments of Stated Interest,"Payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the pound interest payment (determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of such stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the pounds received. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in pounds that has accrued with respect to the Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such pound denominated accrued stated interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate such accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the relevant taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt of the stated interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pound payment received (determined based on the spot rate ----- on the date such stated interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and will be treated for foreign tax credit purposes as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.4,Original Issue Discount,"If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than the stated principal amount, such Notes will be considered to have been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis threshold (generally equal to 1/4 of 1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their issue date). If a Note is issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on the Note, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion of OID is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period generally will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determining on the base of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the aggregate of all stated interest allocable to the accrual period. In general, the “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual period is its issue price and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any U.S. Holder, reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of stated interest) previously made on the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals on the Euro Notes only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Euro Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to such Euro Notes as of the issue date. To the extent that stated interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the stated interest to be accrued or paid during the accrual period based on such fixed rate on the date of issue, such difference will be accounted for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an adjustment to stated interest and will have no effect on the computation of OID. OID will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by a holder on an accrual basis, as described above. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of principal. The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their application. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.49.6,"Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes","Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest or accrued OID, which will be taxable as such to the extent not previously included in income as described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue Discount”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes this election, the election must be applied consistently by such holder from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If the Notes are not traded on an established securities market (or, if the Notes are so traded, but an accrual basis U.S. Holder has not made the settlement date election), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss (as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate on the date of settlement) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized (based on the spot rate on the date of disposition). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its cost for the Note (increased by previously accrued OID and reduced by payments on the Notes other than payments of stated interest). The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price determined based on the spot rate on the date of purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue Discount.” Any such exchange gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued and unpaid state interest and accrued OID) will be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable disposition by a U.S. Holder, and generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss. Gain or loss in excess of exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year. For ----- non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for preferential rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently 24 per cent) with respect to payments on the Notes and the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides its taxpayer identification number to the Paying Agent and certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that it is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding withheld from a payment to a U.S. Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain thresholds generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.

However, proposed Treasury Regulations have been issued that provide for the extensions of the date on which withholding applies to foreign passthru payments to the date that is two years after the publication date of final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. In the preamble to these proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department indicated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until the issuance of final regulations. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” from FATCA unless “materially modified” (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after expiration of the grandfather period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules ----- described herein.

The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except to the extent discussed in “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance _Act,” and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, or_ any state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations (including Proposed Treasury Regulations) promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules; ----- - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; - real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers and traders in securities or currencies; - individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts; - S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value); - tax-exempt organizations and governmental organizations; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (within the meaning of Section 451 of the Code); and - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.

Full Moon Holdco 6 Limited will use the proceeds so received, or equivalent funds received from its subsidiaries, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay its obligations to the Issuer under certain existing proceeds loans and indirectly fund the Existing Notes Redemption, (ii) indirectly repay a portion of our capitalized interest on the Subordinated Shareholder Loans and (iii) pay related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing. Upon the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes will be the obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Company, Full Moon Holdco 4 Limited, Full Moon Holdco 5 Limited, Full Moon Holdco 6 Limited, Full Moon Holdco 7 Limited and Travelodge Hotels Limited (together, the “Guarantors”). The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which £550.0 million (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional GBP Notes having identical terms and conditions as the GBP Notes (the “Additional GBP Notes”) and additional Euro Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Euro Notes (the “Additional Euro Notes” and together with the Additional GBP Notes, the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”), provided that any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code from the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” The Senior Secured_ Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior Secured Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver, redemption, offer to purchase or other modification of the Indenture or any other action by the holders of any series of Senior Secured Notes hereunder which are not specifically distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in ----- respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor _Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents.

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of the Issuer, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and “creditors” winding up”. The “désastre” procedure in respect of a Jersey company may be instigated by the Commission, an eligible creditor or the company making an application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “désastre”, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of the declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor in respect of the debt, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any action or legal proceedings to recover the debt. A secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012, as amended (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor in respect of the balance of the debt, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any action or legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt. There are two forms of “creditors' winding up” available in respect of a Jersey company pursuant to the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”): (a) a court ordered procedure (a “court ordered creditors' winding up”) which is instigated by an eligible creditor of the company making an application for an order of the Royal Court to commence a creditors' winding up; and (b) a voluntary procedure (a “non-court ordered creditors' winding up”) which is instigated by a special resolution of the shareholders of the company. On a creditors' winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the applying creditor (in the case of a court ordered creditors' winding up) or the shareholders (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up). The court (in the case of a court ordered creditors' winding up) or the creditors (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up) may approve such a liquidator or appoint a different liquidator. In the case of a court ordered creditors' winding up, the Royal Court may also appoint a provisional liquidator in the intervening period between the initial application and the order to commence the creditors' winding up. In the case of a court ordered creditors' winding up, the liquidator (including any liquidator appointed provisionally) must, within seven days of their appointment, give known creditors notice calling a creditors' meeting to be held 21 days' after the date of the relevant order of the Royal Court and, in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up, the shareholders must give creditors 14 days' notice of the meeting to commence the creditors' winding up, with a meeting of creditors' to be held immediately following such commencement meeting. Any liquidator appointed provisionally will carry out such functions as ----- conferred by, and may have their powers limited by, the Royal Court. Once the creditors' winding up has commenced, the liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a liquidator provisionally or the commencement of the creditors' winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. A secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the company, and may not, without leave of the Royal Court, take or proceed with any other action to recover the balance of the debt. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its creditors' winding up if (among other things) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The Royal Court may, on application of the company (or a creditor or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator) order a meeting to be called at which the proposed scheme of arrangement must be agreed to by a majority in number representing: - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders), as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers the sanction of the scheme of arrangement. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of them) agree to the scheme of arrangement and, following such agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the scheme of arrangement, the scheme of arrangement is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being wound up).",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate. Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract. A disclaimer operates to determine, as from the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor, debtor's property and the Viscount from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court thinks fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to a Jersey company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of center of main interests does not apply. Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey (as detailed above). Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The shares held by Full Moon Holdco 5 Limited in the Issuer are secured pursuant to a Jersey law governed security interest agreement. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on ----- which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (being the grantor, any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the Royal Court on application by a person entitled to the surplus. In the case of the bankruptcy of the grantor of a security interest under the 2012 Law, such security interest is void against the Viscount (or liquidator of such grantor) and such grantor's creditors unless such security interest is perfected in accordance with the 2012 Law before such grantor becomes bankrupt.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge may (i) dispose of or take action relating to assets subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge, (ii) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder. Only with prior approval of the court (or the relevant secured creditor) can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator will apply the gross proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder; (b) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may rank prior to the floating charge over the same assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge is granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security of which the fixed charge holder was aware); (c) provided that the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders) properly incurred in a winding-up or administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) to the extent the assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims (the same does not apply to fixed charge assets); (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a thirdparty good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges and clawback risks under English insolvency law (see “—Voidable Floating Charges”); and ----- (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims, certain unpaid pension contributions and certain tax obligations)) and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds (see “—Administration and Floating Charges”). Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also “— _Administrative Receivership.”_",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively to determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless (s)he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. ----- An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). If a company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the administrators. Accordingly, if any of the Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of_ an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “Transactions _at an Undervalue”, “Preference” and “Voidable Floating Charge” below, respectively).

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration” above). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). ----- To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act which, in the context of a non-English company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors (but a creditor-led scheme nonetheless requires the company’s consent). If a simple majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium” above) to provide protection pending the sanction of the scheme if the relevant company is eligible.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured; it includes the following provisions. _Moratorium_ Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a ‘monitor’. As a condition to commencement of the moratorium, the company requires confirmation from the monitor that the company is eligible for the moratorium and that, in the monitor’s view, it is likely that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. ----- The moratorium is available to companies that are, or are likely to become, unable to pay their debts. A company is excluded from being eligible for the moratorium if (among other matters): - at any time in the previous 12 months, the company has been subject to a formal insolvency proceeding; or - the company is party to a ‘capital market arrangement’ (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under which a party has incurred a debt of at least £10 million, where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, among other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. The moratorium lasts for an initial period of 20 business days, subject to possible extension. A company subject to a moratorium effectively receives a payment holiday in respect of its premoratorium debts, subject to broad exceptions (including debts or liabilities arising under a contract involving financial services). The company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force (‘moratorium debts’) including those which arise during the moratorium under an obligation incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as ‘priority pre-moratorium debts’), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts. The monitor must terminate the moratorium if certain circumstances arise, including if the monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of a company as a going concern. If a company enters liquidation within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, any unpaid moratorium debts, and certain pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium, will have priority over other claims in the liquidation. Pre-existing financial debts accelerated during the moratorium will not receive such priority, other than in respect of amounts which already fell due during the moratorium. If a company enters administration within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, the administrator must make a distribution in respect of any unpaid moratorium debts, and those pre moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium and which are payable in priority over other claims in administration. Any person affected by the moratorium may challenge it on certain grounds, including that of unfair harm, at any time during the moratorium. _Restructuring Plan Procedure_ CIGA also introduced a new restructuring procedure, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility of cross-class cram-down to bind classes of dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators); the consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholders) is required if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company need only have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a restructuring plan where the plan company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act which, in the context of a non-English company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. ----- The process closely resembles that of schemes of arrangement. At the first hearing, the court will examine the constitution of classes as proposed by the plan proponent. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant stakeholder meetings, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic interest in the company. Subject to the requisite voting thresholds being met, at a second hearing, the court will consider if the necessary requirements have been met (including the requirements for binding a dissenting class, if applicable) and will consider whether to sanction the restructuring plan. For a class of stakeholders to approve the plan, at least 75% in value, of those voting, must vote in favor. The plan may still be confirmed by the court even where certain classes do not vote in favor, provided that: - the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the plan were not sanctioned); and - at least one class who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan. The court retains discretion as to whether to sanction the plan. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium” above) to provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of a standalone moratorium (see “Moratorium” above), any creditors in respect of ‘moratorium debts’ and ‘priority pre-moratorium debts’ may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan without their consent. Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months, whereas the primary ground for a creditors’ voluntary liquidation is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United Kingdom in addition ----- to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant counterparty. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A CVA cannot affect the right of a secured or preferential creditor, except with its consent. A CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors. A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area but has its “center of main interests” in a member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) or in the United Kingdom. ----- In order for the CVA proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Shareholders of the company are also asked to vote on the CVA but, whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a CVA except to the extent that it is under-secured. A secured creditor who proves in the CVA for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. A CVA does not trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property are applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (see “—Prescribed Part” below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest (less the costs of realization); - Second ranking claims: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver (if applicable); - Third ranking claims: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following the end of any (new, stand-alone) moratorium (see further above), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid priority pre-moratorium debts; - Fourth ranking claims: expenses incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings, including the remuneration of the insolvency practitioner (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fifth ranking claims: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of ----- employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee National Insurance contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer National Insurance contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers as well as bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent such claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Sixth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “— _Prescribed Part”);_ - Seventh ranking claims: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any remaining debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors in full; - secondly, interest on the company's debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however does not include ""currency conversion"" claims following the UK Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and - Eighth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Under current law, this applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations, and (b) 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English chargor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The “official exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle exchange rate in the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the court finds that the rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate. Accordingly, in the event that a company which has granted a guarantee or security or the Issuer goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such English company went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual, or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the transaction must have occurred within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will not generally make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third-party which benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended and as set out in detail above), in which case there is a presumption the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts in such proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1828,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1828.2,England and Wales,1828.2.17,Preference,"Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or give such other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) on the grounds such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third-party which benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts ----- as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not (s)he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant chargor) the Account Bank will no longer be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights in relation to the account, except where the Account Banks have expressly reserved set-off rights. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The floating charge will, however, be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a “connected person” the charge can be challenged if given within two years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. A liquidator or administrator can inform the relevant floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid (or only partly valid as regards new consideration). This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek to enforce the charge (which would then likely trigger an application from the office holder for a court declaration that the charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as to its validity. _Recharacterization of Fixed Charges_ As referred to above (see “Fixed Versus Floating Charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized as a floating charge. If such recharacterization falls within the suspect period referred to above (see “Voidable Floating Charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the consideration.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

More specifically, such transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the Note Guarantee and the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each obligor that is incorporated in England and Wales by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally acknowledges that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Supreme Court has held that the shift takes place when a company is “insolvent or bordering on insolvency,” or an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. ----- Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor or security provider incorporated in England and Wales are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. _Security Registration_ Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where not governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor. Further, failure to register also means that the debt which was intended to be secured is deemed to have become immediately payable. In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England and Wales may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of its creation. Alternatively it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security. Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although may still need to be registered with the applicable asset registry). The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “Liquidation/Winding-up” above) and pursuant to the moratorium procedure under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act (see “Moratorium” above). _Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_ CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the Insolvency Act. The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or services which permits the supplier to terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g. impose amended terms), on the grounds that the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency procedure, will be void. A relevant insolvency procedure for this purpose includes winding-up proceedings, administration, the standalone moratorium and the new restructuring plan procedure, but not a scheme of arrangement. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after ----- commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Guarantors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws. It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to a Guarantor could be opened in a different jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In particular, on December 31, 2020, the end of the transition period occurred under the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European Member State, including for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “EU Judgments Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (together, the “Insolvency Brexit Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019). Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of a European Member State opening insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Guarantor may vary between Member States; the implications of any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of recognition in the United Kingdom, would need to be carefully considered in each case. Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., nonEnglish) court may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings where any English company has its center of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible ----- to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States or other insolvency laws. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) commencing administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy a judgment debt (or similar court order). The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by English law governed security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and of the security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.1,Jersey,854.1.1,,"The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognized); - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine; ----- - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533
261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.2,England and Wales,854.2.1,,"The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it (even if the judgment is subject to subsequent appeal) and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a nonEnglish penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; ----- - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of England and Wales. The documents relating to the Collateral for the Notes will be governed by the laws of England and Wales and Jersey. The Indenture (including the Notes Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors are nonresidents of the United States. Since all of the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any monies owed under a judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, while such appointments are effective. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any of their directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant defendant has assets.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £2,099,000 and £4,550,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to £3,410,000 (2021: £2,060,000) for the group financial statements and £1,574,000 (2021: £1,300,000) for the parent company financial statements. In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £227,000 (group audit) (2021: £137,000) and £227,000 (parent company audit) (2021: £93,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. ###### Conclusions relating to going concern Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: Critically assessing the assumptions within the models including; assessing the historical accuracy of management's forecasts and obtained corroborating evidence for the assumptions used including forecast RevPAR; Evaluating the directors’ assessment of the continuous demand for hotel accommodation, the potential impact of inflation, rising costs of living, energy costs and the ability of the Group to manage costs, agreeing to evidence where available and ensuring they align to our understanding of the business; Obtaining and reviewed the Group’s financing agreements; Performing independent sensitivity analyses to the severe but plausible case to assess the impact on liquidity headroom; and |Financial statements - group Financial statements - parent company|Col2|Col3| |---|---|---| |Overall £4,550,000 (2021: £2,750,000). £2,099,000 (2021: £1,800,000). materiality||| |How we 0.5% (2021: 0.5%) of Consolidated revenue (2021: 1% (2021: 1%) of Total Liabilities determined it Consolidated revenue) (2021: Total Liabilities)||| |Rationale for benchmark applied|Due to the impact of the pandemic, profits/losses are fluctuating year-on-year.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. ###### Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.17,Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements,1829.17.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to Health and safety regulations and Data Protection legislation, and we considered the extent to which noncompliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as Taxation legislation, the Companies Act 2006, VAT legislation and Employment legislation. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate reported results and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included: Evaluating management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities; Making enquiries with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in significant accounting estimates; Reviewing Board meeting and other minutes to identify any non-compliance; and Identifying and testing unusual journals posted to revenue. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

Rent expense is adjusted so that the rent reductions agreed during the CVA (for 2020 and 2021) are recognised in the year in which the benefit occurred (in order to more closely reflect cash payments), and the benefit of rent free periods agreed in the ordinary course of rent negotiation are spread on a straight line basis until the next rent review.

Our base case forecast RevPAR is broadly in line with the latest available external forecasts, with LfL RevPAR across 2023 marginally ahead of 2022 levels, with total revenue benefiting from new openings since 2022. Our most significant cost is rent, with each lease reviewed on a five-yearly cycle in line with the relevant inflationary uplift, typically RPI or CPI. We have subsequently completed a lease regear with LXI on 27 January, inserting caps and collars of 4% pa and 1% pa into 97 of the 122 leases that were previously uncapped and uncollared RPI rent reviews, giving increased certainty over rent costs. The remaining leases, subject to obtaining superior landlord consent, are expected to complete in quarter two. Other costs include wages, impacted by the National Living Wage, and are assumed to increase in line with the forecasts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, with supply costs increased in line with inflation or specific supply chain increases. Our energy costs are fixed at pre-crisis levels until March 2023 and since preparing our base case we have hedged a significant proportion of 2023 forecast energy volumes at favourable prices compared to the base case scenario. We consider the base case to be reflective of the range of outcomes we face and there are also a number of potential upsides and mitigations that have not been included, such as the potential for additional demand as a result of customers trading down to the budget segment, staycation demand, events, changes in working patterns and inbound demand.

Revenue for 2023 is modelled to grow by a further 5%.

The Board has therefore considered various other severe but plausible downside scenarios, including the possibility that inflation is significantly higher than the base case and that corporate demand is slower to recover. These downsides scenarios have the following impacts: Higher inflation – in the event that RPI and CPI were 8% and 7% respectively for 2022, then reducing to 5% and 4% in 2023, the Group would still maintain significant headroom. Our base forecast includes contractually agreed costs for the key cost of sales categories, laundry and food, it also includes the impact of the current available forecasts for National Living Wage increases. Our energy costs are fully hedged to March 2023 and rent increases are driven predominantly by inflation linked reviews. Each lease reviewed on a five-yearly cycle and this review cycle for the estate is broadly spread evenly over a five-year period, the impact against the base case to the end of 2023 is therefore limited. Slower corporate recovery – in the event that the assumed recovery in ‘white collar’ demand, serviced predominantly through our corporate sales channels, is slower than our base forecast the Group would still maintain significant headroom. This scenario assumes revenue from the corporate sales channels are c. 18% further below 2019 levels compared to the base scenario, resulting in total RevPAR back c. 2% on 2019 levels in 2022. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 2** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** In these severe but plausible downside scenarios, either individually or in combination, and before potential mitigation which could reasonably be expected to be available, the group retains sufficient liquidity and does not breach covenants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

261,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1834,FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1834.12,2.8** **Leasing,1834.12.1,,"_The Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for_ The Group leases various properties, all but a few being hotel properties. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 25 years or 35 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any financial covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, and - any initial direct costs ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 2** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** _Variable lease payments_ Variable lease payments that depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs. _Extension and termination options_ a) Lessee options Due to a property lease term typically being for 25 years or 35 years lessee lease extension and termination options are not considered until 3 years prior to the termination date (in line with our 3 year planning process) unless commercial negotiations have commenced sooner. b) Lessor options Lessor only extension rights apply to a number of our properties and as required by IFRS 16 the period of the option to extend the lease is included as part of the overall lease term. _As a lessee_ The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentives received. End of lease restoration costs are excluded from the initial cost as lease properties are continuously maintained and refurbished. The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset and the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of use assets are determined by the contractual terms of the leases, taking into account break clauses and lease extension options as set out above. In addition, the right-of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, the incremental borrowing rate specific to that lease. Generally, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or when there is a lease modification. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right- of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group has elected to recognise all its property right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. It has elected not to recognise short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. _As a lessor_ When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.

The tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired (see also 'Brand' policy above). The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the asset. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.

Derivatives are not basic financial instruments. They are initially recognised at fair value, changes in which are recognised in profit or loss unless they are included in a hedging arrangement. The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures and they are designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is shown as non-current if the maturity date of the hedged item is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Board has taken into account the unprecedented circumstances and economic uncertainty caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to the hotel sector in which the Group operates, a range of potential trading outcomes, availability of government support and mitigating actions which could be taken. Whilst the current government timeline to ease restrictions, the reduced infection rates, vaccination programme and market expectations suggest the potential for recovery, the Board considers the Group‟s future performance to be sensitive to the ability of hotels to re-open and remain open, the speed at which demand recovers and the ability of the business to obtain covenant waivers or receive additional funding should these be required. Availability of funding The Group entered into a CVA in June 2020, as part of which it negotiated a significant rent reduction of £140m from Q2 2020 through to the end of 2021. The Group also fully drew down its £40m revolving credit facility (“RCF”), agreed revised covenants on the RCF through to September 2021, entered into a new £60m super senior secured term loan, received additional shareholder contributions of £40m and issued £65m of fixed rate notes in addition to the £440m floating rate bond already in issue. The group used and continues to use the Government Furlough Scheme to partially reimburse the cost of employees unable to work their full contracted hours during the hotel closures and periods of low demand. Covenants The Group agreed a covenant waiver on the RCF financial covenant. Under the revised terms, the Group‟s existing springing quarterly net leverage covenant requirements, which apply if drawings under the RCF are £32m or more, are not tested until 30 September 2021 and for this period have been replaced with a minimum liquidity covenant of £10m. The new super senior term loan also introduced a £10m minimum liquidity covenant over the term of the loan and a new minimum Last Twelve Months EBITDA covenant, effective from June 2022. The Group‟s currently available facilities, indebtedness and details of covenants are set out in note 19. ----- **THAME AND LONDON LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTINUED) 2** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** Base case scenario The base case assumes that the majority of our hotels are reopened for trading during May 2021, in line with the current roadmap out of lockdown for England and separate guidance for Wales and Scotland, and gradually build back towards pre-Covid-19 levels of trade. Across 2021, the assumption is that RevPAR is on average c. 33% lower than 2019 levels, ending the year with RevPAR down c. 11% vs 2019 in December 2021 (aligning for like for like weeks) and recovering to pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of Q1 2022. The base case scenario includes the benefits of actions already taken by management to enable the business to successfully trade through the impact of Covid-19, to the extent they are currently available. These involve a number of key components including: continued action by the company to preserve cash flow with reduced discretionary spend; making use of government measures where possible, including furloughing team members under the Job Retention Scheme where appropriate and benefiting from the Hospitality Business Rates Relief programme; and temporary rent reductions under the terms of the Company Voluntary Arrangement (“CVA”). We consider the base case to be a conservative assessment assuming the current roadmap of hotel reopening and there are a number of potential upsides and mitigations that have not been included such as potential additional demand from our predominantly domestic customer base with ongoing restrictions to foreign travel. Under this base case scenario, the Group is expected to continue to have liquidity headroom and to comply with its banking covenants.  We have modelled repayment of £8m under the RCF prior to the end of September 2021 to reduce the draw down to under £32m, which would avoid the net leverage covenant being tested. The model shows headroom over the liquidity covenant throughout, including in December 2021 and March 2022, after the revised rent agreements under the CVA expire, with a seasonal low point in January 2022. Severe but plausible downside scenarios Given the current uncertainty around the ongoing potential impact of Covid-19 and the challenges around forecasting the impact on the hotel sector, the Board has considered the following severe but plausible downside scenarios to stress test the Group‟s financial forecasts. Our performance will be closely linked to factors outside of our control and most significantly the timing of restrictions being lifted and the pace of recovery thereafter which will be impacted by a number of things including the vaccination roll-out and any Covid-19 driven longer-term changes in customer behaviour. The Board has considered various severe but plausible downside scenarios, including the possibility that the lifting of restrictions is delayed beyond the dates currently in the roadmap; the recovery profile is slower than that assumed in the base case; and there is a further 1 month lockdown period in the next 12 months. These downside scenarios, which continue to model that the £8m repayment is made under the RCF agreement, have the following impacts: - Lockdown extension - If hotel opening was delayed to the end of June 2021, the Group would be close to breaching the minimum liquidity covenant from the end of June 2021 and would breach covenants in December 2021 and potentially also need additional funding in January 2022. - Slower recovery - In the event that the recovery is slower than our base forecast, but no extension to support schemes, with sales only having recovered to c.75% of 2019 levels in Q4 2021, with Q1 2022 then c.3% below 2019 levels, and sales recovering to 2019 levels thereafter, the Group would breach covenants in December 2021 and potentially also need additional funding in January 2022. This scenario reflects 2021 RevPAR being on average c.38% lower than 2019 levels compared to c.33% lower in the base case. ----- **THAME AND LONDON LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTINUED) 2** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** - Additional lockdown - In the event there was a need for another national lockdown in the latter part of 2021, the Group would breach covenants in December 2021 and potentially also need additional funding in December 2021, depending on the level of government support available under such a scenario. Each of these downside scenarios are individually plausible and some combination of all factors could also apply. If the lockdown extension scenario is combined with the slower recovery scenario, or the return to trading is even slower than these scenarios, liquidity issues could arise earlier. In all scenarios there are mitigating actions that the Group could take to improve the cash flow position, especially in particular months where liquidity is lower, including delaying planned discretionary spending on capital expenditure or working capital management measures. The Group has already proactively approached lenders to start discussions about covenants, however, given the current level of uncertainty and wide range of potential outcomes, both better and worse than our base case, we are not yet in a position to conclude these discussions. The liquidity challenges and pressure on the covenants under the individual downside scenarios arise from December 2021 as the revised rent agreements under the CVA expire but liquidity increases from Q2 2022. There were also new support measures announced in the March budget including property grants and the Recovery Loan Scheme which could potentially be used to increase available cash. If needed the Group could also seek to obtain additional funding, either through third parties or potentially with the shareholders, however, the Board cannot predict with any certainty how these parties would respond. Based on the above scenarios, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. However, we are likely to continue to be subject to the impact of Covid-19 and at this stage, we are unable to predict with any certainty the extent or duration of this impact on the Group.  There are severe but plausible downside scenarios in which the Group and Company would not have adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future. This indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Group‟s and Company‟s ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements, as drafted, do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group or Company were unable to continue as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 25 years or 35 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, and - any initial direct costs _Variable lease payments_ Variable lease payments that depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs. _Extension and termination options_ a) Lessee options Due to a property lease term typically being for 25 years or 35 years lessee lease extension and termination options are not considered until 3 years prior to the termination date (in line with our 3 year planning process) unless commercial negotiations have commenced sooner. b) Lessor options Lessor only extension rights apply to a number of our properties and as required by IFRS 16 the period of the option to extend the lease is included as part of the overall lease term. ----- **THAME AND LONDON LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTINUED) 2** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)** _As a lessee_ The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentives received. End of lease restoration costs are excluded from the initial cost as lease properties are continuously maintained and refurbished. The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset and the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of use assets are determined on the same basis as those of plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, the incremental borrowing rate specific to that lease. Generally, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or when there is a lease modification. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right- of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group has elected to recognise all its property right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. It does not separately identify short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. _As a lessor_ When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. The lease classification of a sub-lease is also based on an assessment of the risks and rewards of ownership of the right-of-use-asset arising from the head lease, in particular whether or not the risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessor. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight line basis over the lease term as part of „net rent expenses‟ (note 6). -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  that sufficient taxable profits will be available to all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired (see also 'Brand' policy above). The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the asset. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.

Derivatives are not basic financial instruments. They are initially recognised at fair value, changes in which are recognised in profit or loss unless they are included in a hedging arrangement. The Group‟s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures and they are designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group‟s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is shown as non-current if the maturity date of the hedged item is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same year in which the hedge item affects net profit or loss. Interest hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.

Our base forecasts already includes higher inflationary increases across the supply chain and contractually agreed costs for a number of significant supplies. Under our severe but plausible scenario, we consider the impact in the event that RPI and CPI were 2 % points higher than our base forecast 2023. The most significant cost impacted by higher inflation, in addition to the base forecast, is rent. Each lease is reviewed on a five-yearly cycle and this review cycle for the estate is broadly spread evenly over a five-year period, the impact against the base case to the end of 2024 as a result of higher inflation is therefore limited.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 25 years or 35 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any financial covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentives received. End of lease restoration costs are excluded from the initial cost as lease properties are continuously maintained and refurbished. The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset and the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of use assets are determined by the contractual terms of the leases, taking into account break clauses and lease extension options as set out above. In addition, the right-of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, the incremental borrowing rate specific to that lease. Generally, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or when there is a lease modification. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right- of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group has elected to recognise all its property right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

The tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all, or part of, the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired (see also 'Brand' policy above). The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the asset. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Derivatives are not basic financial instruments. They are initially recognised at fair value, changes in which are recognised in profit or loss unless they are included in a hedging arrangement. The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures and they are designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is shown as non-current if the maturity date of the hedged item is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same year in which the hedge item affects net profit or loss. Interest hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.

The arrangement represents an equity-settled share-based payment. If an exit event occurs and the sale proceeds are insufficient to cover management’s entitlement on the exit event, the company is obligated to settle the arrangement. This arrangement represents a cashsettled share-based payment. The company has issued warrants to a small group of employees for the option to acquire share capital in Anchor on an exit event. The employees will only receive value from their shareholdings if there is an exit event and they remain in employment by the company or another group company at the date of exit. The arrangement constitutes an equity-settled share-based payment. If an exit event occurs and the sale proceeds are insufficient to cover the employee’s entitlement on the exit event, the company is obligated to settle the arrangement. This arrangement represents a cash-settled share-based payment. _Equity-settled_ Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted using a Binomial Lattice model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest. A corresponding adjustment is made to equity. The expense in relation to options over Anchor’s shares granted to employees of the company is recognised by the company as a capital contribution. _Modifications and cancellations_ When the terms and conditions of equity-settled share-based payments at the time they were granted are subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions (the “original fair value”) and under the modified terms and conditions (the “modified fair value”) are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The sharebased payment expense is not adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value.

Travelodge considers it reasonably certain that Landlords will exercise the options granted to them under the 2012 and 2020 CVA agreements to extend leases, e.g., for a further 3, 5 or 7 years. For affected leases the extension period has been added to the non-cancellable period of the lease term in calculating the Lease liability and Right of use asset. In leases where Travelodge, as Tenant, has the option to renew for a further 25 or 35 years upon expiry of the lease, management do not believe a such a determination can be made at this time with reasonable certainty, and for such leases this extension period has not been added to the non-cancellable period of the lease term in calculating the Lease liability and Right of use asset.

This is not subject to annual amortisation but is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. (2) Assets under construction predominantly consists of costs in relation to the construction of new hotels which have not opened yet and investment in IT. Once complete the costs are transferred to the appropriate asset category. (3) IT software is measured initially at purchase cost and is amortised on a straight line basis over three years. (4) Movement on capital creditors represents the year on year movement in accrued capital expenditure at year end. (5) Transfers between categories include £3.3m (2020: £1.6m) of leasehold premiums reclassified to right of use assets. The brand name acquired through the acquisition of the Travelodge business was assigned a fair market value at the date of acquisition. The value of the brand name is reviewed annually for impairment. This is derived by estimating the amount of royalty income that could be generated from the brand name if it was owned by an independent third party using a royalty of 4.0% on forecast future revenues, which is considered to be the market value that could be achieved. The sales forecast is based on a sales forecast for the period 2022 - 26 and an estimated long term growth rate of 2.0% (2020: 2.0%). The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. This is discounted at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.1% (2020: 10.6%) which is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and referencing inputs from a portfolio of similar hotel businesses. The Group considers the value of the brand name, which was first introduced into the UK in 1985, will be maintained indefinitely and is therefore not amortised. A sensitivity was performed and confirmed that the royalty rate could be reduced to 0.7% (2020: 1.6%) or the discount factor rate would need to increase to 26.0% (2020: 23.1%) before an impairment is triggered. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 15** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT** An analysis of property, plant and equipment for 2021 is given below: At 31 December 2021 2.2 1.6 98.7 102.5 At 31 December 2020 1.5 1.6 117.6 120.7 ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 15** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)** An analysis of property, plant and equipment for 2020 is given below: At 31 December 2020 1.5 1.6 117.6 120.7 At 31 December 2019 2.9 1.6 128.4 132.9 (1) Assets under construction predominantly consists of on-going maintenance and refit projects. Once complete the costs are transferred to the appropriate asset category. (2) Freehold, freehold and long leasehold buildings includes freehold land stated at cost of £20,100 (2020: £20,100) which is not depreciated. Freehold land and long leasehold properties are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. (3) Fixtures and fittings are initially measured at cost and are depreciated over three to 5 years. (4) Movement on capital creditors represents the year on year movement in accrued capital expenditure at year end. In line with its accounting policy, the Group assesses the carrying value of all cash generating units, which would include individual hotels, where there are indications of potential impairment. Impairment reviews are performed annually at the Group's year end of 31 December. In order to form an estimate of the value in use, the Company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and financial plans approved by the Directors and extrapolates cash flows beyond this time based on an estimated long term growth rate of 2.0% (2020: 2.0%). The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. Reviews are performed on a site by site basis over the length of the lease. The Directors have considered the Company's financial projections and the assumptions which underpin those projections including future growth of the budget hotel sector, brand demand and occupancy. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 15** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)** The long term growth rate assumption has been considered with reference to the compound annual growth rate collated by Smith Travel Research for the hotel sector over an 18-year period. In general, the midscale & economy sector, of which Travelodge is part, outperforms the rest of the hotel sector, nevertheless, a significant element of prudence was applied by the Company in selecting a rate below the long term average. The discount rate assumption has been calculated with reference to the market-weighted average pre-tax cost of capital based on a portfolio of similar hotel businesses using the Capital Asset Pricing Model as a starting point. As permitted by the IAS 36, this is then adjusted to reflect the estimated incremental borrowing cost of leasing for each asset based on market rates at the date of the review, in line with the methodology for assessing the variation in the discount rate by asset used to calculate the discount rate which has been used to derive the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet as a result of IFRS 16. This resulted in a weighted average pre-tax discount rate of 7.1% (2020: 10.6%). The availability of comparable market data has improved over time since the introduction of IFRS16 and this has allowed the Group to refine the inputs for each source of capital based on market participant data compared to flexed Travelodge weighted average cost of capital previously used as a basis, resulting in the decrease in pre-tax discount rate year on year. As a result of this review, an impairment charge of £0.1m (2020: £0.5m) has been made in the year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

These assets with a finite life are reviewed for impairment when an impairment trigger is identified. Calculating any subsequent impairment, principally in the estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units and the discount rate applied to each cash generating unit involves judgement. In order to form an estimate of the value in use, the Company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and financial plans approved by the Directors and extrapolates cash flows beyond this time based on an estimated long term growth rate of 2.0% (2019: 2.5%). The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. Reviews are performed on a site by site basis over the length of the lease. The Directors have considered the Company's financial projections and the assumptions which underpin those projections including future growth of the budget hotel sector, brand demand and occupancy. The long term growth rate assumption has been considered with reference to the compound annual growth rate collated by Smith Travel Research for the hotel sector over an 18-year period. In general, the midscale & economy sector, of which Travelodge is part, outperforms the rest of the hotel sector, nevertheless, a significant element of prudence was applied by the Company in selecting a rate below the long term average. The discount rate assumption has been calculated with reference to the market-weighted average pre-tax cost of capital based on a portfolio of similar hotel businesses using the Capital Asset Pricing Model as a starting point. As permitted by the IAS 36, this is then adjusted to reflect the estimated incremental borrowing cost of leasing for each asset based on market rates at the date of the review, in line with the methodology for assessing the variation in the discount rate by asset used to calculate the discount rate which has been used to derive the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet as a result of IFRS 16. This resulted in a weighted average pre-tax discount rate of 10.6% (2019: 8.3%), compared to a range of 7.6% to 11.5% (2019: 6.8% to 9.3%) for the Company's portfolio of leases. Following this review, a charge of £8.7m was made in the year for those assets where the carrying value exceeded the discounted estimated future cash flows. This charge is in respect of Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Right of Use assets. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis in respect of the discount rate applied, short term growth rate as well as the long term growth rates. The increase in the pre-tax discount in the year of 2.3% to 10.6% in 2020 was driven largely as a result of the pandemic, and a further deterioration of this magnitude is, in the Company's view, unlikely in the absence of any future catastrophic event. Nevertheless, for context, a further increase of 1% to 11.6% in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional charge of £17m. This sensitivity is driven largely by an increase in impairment across a small number of sites, already impaired as a result of the initial assessment. The majority of these sites were not affected by the CVA lease modifications and as a result, the corresponding right of use assets were established at a historic discount rate which is significantly below that used to discount the future cash flows for the value in use calculations. If future cash flows varied by 5% from management assumptions, this would result in an additional impairment charge of £9m. The long term growth rate of 2% used in the value in use calculations is prudent in the Company's view as it is significantly below the long term compound annual growth rate for the midscale and economy sector of 2.8%. Nevertheless, for context, a further deterioration of 0.5 percentage points in the long term growth rate from 2.0% to 1.5% would have resulted in an additional charge of £5.1m, again largely due to an increase in impairment across a small number of sites, already impaired as a result of the initial assessment, and which were not affected by the CVA lease modifications. The Company is therefore comfortable with the rates selected given the inherent prudence in selecting the long term growth rate, and the fact that the discount rate has, as described above, been calculated with reference to the estimated incremental borrowing cost of leasing for each of its assets, based on market rates at the date of the review. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The Group’s policy in respect of non-underlying items is described in Note 2. Within revenue, there is a £0.9m credit from the release of the balance of expired vouchers issued in relation to cancelled stays during periods of lockdown (note these are no longer in circulation). Within operating expenses, a non-underlying charge of £8.4m (£7.1m of which relates to employee costs) includes £3.4m for share based payments and £1.3m of professional fees in connection with implementation of a management incentive plan. The incentive plan and associated charge is considered to be non-underlying given it is a one-off issuance and the timing and value of the vesting are linked to an exit event, the timing of which is uncertain. Also included is a £3.6m charge (of which £2.3m is for share based payments) for costs in respect of compensation for loss of office for the CEO who left during the year due to ill health (therefore one off and not in the normal course of business and non-recurring in nature). Under the terms of the CVA, the business is required to make an additional cash rental payment to Eligible Compromised Landlords based on the cumulative performance of the Group during its 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years (the “Recovery Period”). If the EBITDA (adjusted)[(1)] generated across the Recovery Period is greater than £200m, the business must distribute 66 2/3% (sixty six and two thirds per cent) of the excess amount (the “excess cumulative EBITDA”) to the Eligible Compromised Landlords. Subsequent agreements with individual landlords will be taken into account for their individual payment calculations, which could reduce the overall value paid out. The cumulative EBITDA (adjusted)[(1)] across the three years is £220m, creating an excess cumulative EBITDA of £20m, therefore £13.4m has been accrued in the accounts to pay the Eligible Compromised Landlords in 2023, subject to finalisation of the calculations.￼ This is non-underlying, given it is a non-recurring, one off event linked to the 2020 CVA and not representative of the normal course of business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The early repayment of the loan is a one off event that the business was able to facilitate, but would not be a normal course of action and is therefore nonunderlying in nature. In addition, there was a non-underlying tax credit of £0.1m in the year ended 31 December 2022 relating to the release of the unutilised portion of a provision set up for the estimated liability arising from settlement of the HMRC enquiry into the tax impact of a historical corporate restructure. When the provision was originally created the charge was presented as a non-underlying item. This enquiry was settled in August 2022. Non-underlying items (before taxation) were a net credit of £30.2m for the year ended 31 December 2021, being a £20.3m profit on disposal of assets where break clauses were instigated as a direct result of the CVA, a £6.9m revenue credit from the release of expired vouchers issued in relation to cancelled stays during periods of lockdown and a £3.3m credit from other provision reassessments (including legal provisions no longer required and a potential regulatory provision no longer required), partially offset by a £0.3m charge for the impairment of fixed assets. In addition, there was a non-underlying tax charge of £(4.0)m in the year ended 31 December 2021 in respect of a provision set up for the estimated liability arising from settlement of the HMRC enquiry into the tax impact of a historical corporate restructure.

(4) Movement on capital creditors represents the year on year movement in accrued capital expenditure at year end. (5) Transfers between categories include £2.9m (2021: £3.3m) of leasehold premiums reclassified to right of use assets. The brand name acquired through the acquisition of the Travelodge Hotels Limited business was assigned a fair market value at the date of acquisition. The value of the brand name is reviewed annually for impairment. This is derived by estimating the amount of royalty income that could be generated from the brand name if it was owned by an independent third party using a royalty of 4.0% on forecast future revenues, which is considered to be the market value that could be achieved. The sales forecast is based on a sales forecast for the period 2023 - 27 and an estimated long term growth rate of 2.0% (2021: 2.0%). The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. This is discounted at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.9% (2021: 7.1%) which is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and referencing inputs from a portfolio of similar hotel businesses. The Group considers the value of the brand name, which was first introduced into the UK in 1985, will be maintained indefinitely and is therefore not amortised. A sensitivity was performed and confirmed that the royalty rate could be reduced to 0.9% (2021: 0.7%) or the discount factor rate would need to increase to 30.4% (2021: 26.0%) before an impairment is triggered.

(2) Freehold, freehold and long leasehold buildings includes freehold land stated at cost of £20,100 (2021: £20,100) which is not depreciated. Freehold land and long leasehold properties are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. (3) Fixtures and fittings are initially measured at cost and are depreciated over three to 5 years. (4) Movement on capital creditors represents the year on year movement in accrued capital expenditure at year end. In line with its accounting policy, the Group assesses the carrying value of all cash generating units, which would include individual hotels, where there are indications of potential impairment. Impairment reviews are performed annually at the Group's year end of 31 December. In order to form an estimate of the fair value, the Company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and financial plans approved by the Directors and extrapolates cash flows beyond this time based on an estimated long term growth rate of 2.0% (2021: 2.0%). The key assumptions are consistent with past experience and with external sources of information. Reviews are performed on a site by site basis over the length of the lease. The Directors have considered the Company's financial projections and the assumptions which underpin those projections including future growth of the budget hotel sector, brand demand and occupancy. The financial projections include the expected estimated cash outflows in order to meet the Group’s net zero commitment by 2050. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022 (CONTINUED) 15** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)** The discount rate assumption has been calculated with reference to the market-weighted average pre-tax cost of capital based on a portfolio of similar hotel businesses using the Capital Asset Pricing Model as a starting point. As permitted by IAS 36, this is then adjusted to reflect the estimated incremental borrowing cost of leasing for each asset based on market rates at the date of the review, in line with the methodology for assessing the variation in the discount rate by asset used to calculate the discount rate which has been used to derive the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet as a result of IFRS 16. This resulted in a weighted average pre-tax discount rate of 8.9% (2021: 7.1%). As a result of this review, an impairment charge of £nil (2021: £0.1m) has been made in the year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

On 1 December 2020, the Group repaid both the initial drawdown on the super senior revolving credit facility of £30m and the related ‘take and hold’ fee of £0.6m, as well as accrued interest of £1.3m. On the same date, the new super senior term loan of £60m was drawn in full. An OID fee of £1.9m was incurred in respect to the drawdown of £60m. This was paid in January 2022. This fee has been capitalised and deemed to form a new loan under the facility and is being amortised over the life of the facility in accordance with IFRS. Further loan issue costs of approximately £2.0m will be amortised over the life of the facility accordance with IFRS. In May 2020, the RCF/LOC facility was amended with the net leverage financial covenant for the relevant quarter end testing periods from 30 June 2020 until and including 30 June 2021 being replaced by a minimum liquidity covenant. This was extended on 29 September 2021 to provide a financial covenant holiday until 31 December 2021 and extend the liquidity testing period until 30 June 2022. The minimum liquidity covenant requires that available liquidity is not lower than £10m for any period of five (5) consecutive business days. In March 2022 the Group repaid £8m to reduce drawings under the Group’s existing £40m revolving credit facility (“RCF”) to £32m and revised covenant terms have been agreed with its banking partners. Under the revised covenant terms, the Group’s existing springing covenant requirements, which apply if drawings under the RCF are £32m or more, are not tested and have been replaced with maintenance covenants from 31 March 2022 to 30 June 2023, comprising stepped quarterly net leverage tests and minimum liquidity covenants, after which the business returns back to the previous quarterly net leverage covenant tests, the first of which would be on 30 September 2023.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed above, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through borrowings. The Group borrows at floating rates and uses an interest rate cap to limit the interest paid. £300m of floating rate bonds of £440m are covered by the interest rate cap. As a result of the Bank of England’s discontinuation of LIBOR, certain amendments have been agreed with all relevant counterparties to effectuate a reference rate transition from LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) including margin adjustments in respect of the period from the commencement date of the first interest period commencing on or after 31 December 2021 to the maturity date. Given the Group’s debt facilities position at 31 December 2021 a small movement in SONIA will affect the Group’s interest profile. The Group’s net profit and cash interest payment would increase or decrease by £1.3m (2020: £1.3m) if SONIA rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points. Liquidity risks: The Group has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Credit risk: The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. No collateral is held against liquid funds. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. Currency exposures: At 31 December 2021, the Group had no material currency exposures that would give rise to net currency gains or losses being recognised in the income statement. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021 (CONTINUED) 21** **DEFERRED TAX** The following are the major deferred tax assets and (liabilities) recognised by the Group which are expected to be recovered or settled more than twelve months after the reporting year and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting year.

As per the terms of the cap, if LIBOR exceeded 1.5% after 15 October 2019 (subsequently if SONIA exceeded 1.3807% after 17 January 2022), Travelodge Hotels Limited would receive a cash settlement on the difference between the floating rate and the cap to cover a portion of the scheduled quarterly payments on a notional amount of £300m, up to 15 October 2022. ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022 (CONTINUED) 20** **FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)** The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed above, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through borrowings. The Group borrows at floating rates and has previously used an interest rate cap to limit the interest paid with £300m of floating rate bonds of £440m being covered by the interest rate cap. The cap expired in October 2022 and the Group continues to keep interest rate risk under review but has not purchased a new cap given the current market volatility. Liquidity risks: The Group has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Credit risk: The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. No collateral is held against liquid funds. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.

The subscription of Class L, L1, K and K1 Shares represent an equity-settled share-based payment. The warrants granted for the subscription of Class L and Class L1 Shares also represent an equity-settled share-based payment. _Equity-settled share-based payments_ The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was determined using the Binomial Lattice pricing model. The Binomial Lattice model is considered to apply the most appropriate valuation method due to the relatively short contractual lives of the options and the requirement to exercise within a short period after the employee becomes entitled to the shares (the “vesting date”). Service conditions, which includes continued employment, are taken into account by adjusting the number of options expected to vest at each reporting date. Estimation has been applied in determining the accounting charge, within the valuation model itself, such as revenue growth and the discount rate on a pre-IFRS 16 basis (10.9% June subscription, 11.4% November warrants issue), and the vesting date, which is assumed to be 3 years from the date of the first issue. The resulting charge is £3.4m in respect of costs for employees, and a further £2.3m within the settlement arrangements of the CEO who left during 2022 for health reasons. _Cash-settled share-based payments_ In addition to the MIP and warrant arrangements, the company and employees of the MIP and warrants have entered into an arrangement whereby the company is obligated to settle the arrangement in cash should the proceeds be insufficient to cover the Class L, L1, K and K1 shareholders entitlement on an exit event. This arrangement represents a cash-settled share-based payment. There is only a remote probability that the trigger for the cash settled arrangement would arise, and therefore the value of the liability has been measured at nil and has not been recognised. As a result there is no liability for a future cash settlement recognised in the accounts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The original investor loan note of £95.0m has a termination date of January 2026 with two subsequent tranches drawn in 2020, for £10.0m and £30.0m respectively, having a termination date of 2033. None of the accrued interest relating to these loans was repaid during 2022 (2021: £nil). The loan accrues interest at 15.0% (2021: 15.0%) per annum. Interest accrued in the year is £20.3m (2021: £20.2m) and the total balance including accrued interest was £206.9m (2021: £186.6m).

On 1 September 2021 the super senior term loan was transferred at arm’s length to an unconnected third party. The OID fee of £1.9m incurred in respect of the drawdown of the £60m super senior term loan was repaid in full in January 2022. The full principal amount of £60m was then repaid in October 2022.

According to the straight lining of leases principle under previous IFRS, the benefit of this rent free period is recognised in our income statement as a deduction to the actual rent expense in each year, on a straight line basis, over the full life of each lease, with the unrecognised balance being held as an accrual on our balance sheet. Similarly, any credit relating to the rent reductions (for the financial years 2020 and 2021) resulting from the CVA is also recognised on a straight line basis over the remaining life of each lease. As a result, our total before IFRS 16 rent expense does not reflect our cash payments of rent in any year. EBITDA (adjusted) in each year recognises the portion of the rent free credit attributable to such year as if such credit were applied on a straight line basis until the next rent review, normally five years, and recognises the reductions resulting from the CVA in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each year, which more closely aligns to cash payments.| |VI|Like-for-like RevPAR Like-for-like occupancy Like-for-like average room rates|Revenue per available room, occupancy and average room rate (net of VAT) for UK hotels that have been open for at least two years at the end of the current year on a management reporting period basis.

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Recoverability of the debtors is a new key audit matter this year. The impact of Covid-19 and the impairment of ROU assets and property, plant and equipment, which were key audit matters last year, are no longer included because of the significant reduction in the forecasted impact of Covid-19 going forward and the assumptions in the ROU asset and property, plant and equipment impairment models are not sensitive to change.. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year. |Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter| |---|---| |Changes in right of use assets and lease liability judgements and estimates, and accuracy of lease calculations (group) Refer to the accounting policy and the critical accounting estimates notes, 2.8 and 3.1 of the Group financial statements for management’s disclosures. The Group has £2.1 billion of Right of Use (ROU) assets and £2.4 billion of Lease Liabilities as at 31 December 2021. During the year, there were a high number of lease adjustments due to the rent reviews as well as adjustments arising due to the time lag involved in agreeing the updated lease terms with the landlords. The audit risk in this area relates mainly to the validity of the judgements and estimates used in the valuation of the assets and liabilities relating to new leases, which may be incorrectly accounted for. The key estimate is considered to be the discount rate (incremental borrowing rate) that is applied to new leases. There is also an additional judgement over the length of the leases due to the nature of the renewal clauses included within the lease contracts, over the date of adjustments due to rent reviews and the date at which the adjustment is confirmed. The discount rate, lease extension or termination options and the lease terms, including the likelihood to renew, are therefore the key areas requiring management’s estimate and judgement.

Non-underlying items were removed as they related to non-recurring, one-off items. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £100,000 and £2,610,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2020: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to £2,060,000 (2020: £2,000,000) for the group financial statements and £1,300,000 (2020: £1,200,000) for the company financial statements. In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £137,000 (group audit) (2020: £135,000) and £93,000 (company audit) (2020: £83,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. ###### Conclusions relating to going concern Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: - obtaining the directors' paper and supporting models that support the assessment and conclusions with respect to the going concern status of the Group and Company; - reviewing the letter of support from the Parent Company to confirm that this financial support applies for a period of at least a year from the date of signing these financial statements; and - evaluating the directors’ assessment of the recovery of demand for hotel accommodation, the potential impact of further government restrictions and the ability of the Group to manage costs, agreeing to evidence where available and ensuring they align to our understanding of the business. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. ----- ## Independent auditors report to the members of Thame and London Limited #### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to Health and Safety regulations, Anti Money Laundering and Data Protection regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as UK Income and Value Added Tax legislation, the Companies Act, Employment Law and the implementation of government support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme). We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate reported results and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included: - valuating management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities; - aking enquiries with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; - eviewing Board meeting and other minutes to identify any non-compliance; - hallenging assumptions and judgements made by management in significant accounting estimates; - esting unusual or unexpected journal entries, particularly those impacting revenue. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

As we have exceeded this threshold we are obliged to pay an estimated £13.4m to these landlords in 2023 and have accrued that within these financial statements. Subsequent agreements with landlords will be taken into account for their individual payment calculations, which could reduce the overall value paid out. The payment is expected to be settled in full by the end of April 2023. During January 2023, the Group repurchased £15.8m (nominal) of the floating rate loan notes in issue under a managed buy back programme at a discount of £0.8m to par, which have subsequently been cancelled. On 27 January 2023 Travelodge Hotels Limited completed a lease regear transaction on 97 of the 122 Travelodge hotels leased by LXI REIT with the remainder subject to agreement by superior landlords. As part of the regear new caps and collars on rent reviews were agreed to limit rental increases, and lease extensions averaging nine years across the 122 hotels were secured. The approximate impact on lease liabilities as a result of this regear, had it been complete at 31 December 2022, would have been an increase of £10.3m due to the lease extensions and the updated discount rates as a result of the modification. The methodology used to determine the discount rates is consistent with modifications in the 2022 accounts and with prior years, and the rates are appropriate to the individual properties within the agreement. A 16bps movement in discount rate impacts the lease liability by £3m. ----- **GLOSSARY FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURE (APM)** The Group uses the non-statutory alternative performance measures ‘EBITDA (adjusted)’ and 'Free Cash Flow' to monitor the financial performance of the Group internally. This measure is not a statutory measure in accordance with IFRS. We report these measures because we believe it provides both management and other stakeholders with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Group’s businesses. APMs are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. We believe the non-IFRS measures are useful metrics for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt and because they permit investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures internally to track our business performance, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) facilitates operating performance comparisons between periods and among other companies in industries similar to ours because it removes the effect of variation in capital structures, taxation, and non-cash depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, which may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or nonrecurring items and more closely aligns the recognition of rent free periods and rent reductions in profitability with the corresponding cash impact. In line with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority, we have provided additional information on the APMs used by the Group below, including full reconciliations back to the closest equivalent statutory measure. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

Thame and London Limited is the parent undertaking of the largest and smallest Group of undertakings to consolidate these financial statements at 31 December 2021. The consolidated financial statements of Thame and London Limited are available from Sleepy Hollow, Aylesbury Road, Thame, Oxfordshire, OX9 3AT. Anchor Holdings SCA has provided the Company with investor loans totalling £135.0m (2020: £135.0m). The original investor loan note of £95.0m has a termination date of January 2026. On 24 August 2020 and 2 December 2020, the Group entered into additional investor loan note agreements of £10.0m and £30.0m respectively, with a termination date of 2033. None of the accrued interest relating to these loans was repaid during 2021 (2020: £nil). The loan accrues interest at 15.0% (2020: 15.0%) per annum. Interest accrued in the year is £20.2m (2020: £15.1m) and the total balance including accrued interest was £186.6m (2020: £166.4m). Travelodge Hotels Limited has agreed to make loan facilities available to Anchor Holdings SCA and Anchor Holdings G.P.S.A up to a maximum of £2.2m (2020: £1.5m) and £0.6m (2020: £0.5m) respectively. At the balance sheet date, Anchor Holdings SCA and Anchor Holdings G.P.S.A had utilised £1.4m (2020: £1.3m) and £0.5m (2020: £0.4m) respectively. The loans accrue interest at 8.0% (2020: 8.0%) per annum. Interest accrued in the year was £0.2m (2020: £0.1m), all of which was unpaid. The total interest accrued at the balance sheet date was £0.6m (2020: £0.4m). The interest rate decreases to 5.1% from January 2022. Of the total fees paid as part of the Group's refinancing (see note 20), an amount of £nil (2020: £0.6m) was paid to a financial institution which is related to one of the parent undertakings. The Group entered into a new super senior £60m revolving credit facility agreement on 20 April 2020, with certain financial institutions that are indirect shareholders (or affiliates thereof) of Thame and London Limited. The facility was to fund general corporate and working capital requirements and £30m of this facility was initially drawn, on which ‘take and hold’ fee of £0.6m was incurred. In November 2020, the Group entered into a new super senior term loan agreement which refinanced and replaced the £60m super senior revolving credit facility entered into on 20 April 2020. The super senior facility agreement was between, among others, the Group, the issuer, certain funds managed or advised by GoldenTree Asset Management LP and certain funds managed or advised by Avenue Europe International Management, L.P. (or affiliates thereof) and the agent, Global Loan Agency Services Limited. On 1 December 2020, the Group repaid both the initial drawdown on the super senior revolving credit facility of £30m and the related ‘take and hold’ fee of £0.6m, as well as accrued interest of £1.3m. On the same date, the new super senior term loan of £60m was drawn in full. On 1 September 2021 the super senior term loan was transferred at arm’s length to an unconnected third party. An OID fee of £1.9m was incurred in respect to the drawdown of £60m, payable in January 2022. There will be no scheduled repayment of the principal under the term loan before 5 July 2024. The initial fees payable in connection with the term loan are deferred until after 31 December 2021, and a proportion of the interest is also payable in kind at the borrower’s election. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

The rent phasing adjustment reflects the timing difference between the rent charge for the year in our internal management reporting measure EBITDA (adjusted) and the rent charge for the year under previous IFRS. In many of our leases we receive a rent free period at the beginning of the lease term. According to the straight lining of leases principle under previous IFRS, the benefit of this rent free period is recognised in our income statement as a deduction to the actual rent expense in each year, on a straight line basis, over the full life of each lease, with the unrecognised balance being held as an accrual on our balance sheet. Similarly, any credit relating to the rent reductions resulting from the CVA is also recognised on a straight line basis over the remaining life of each lease. As a result, our total before IFRS 16 rent expense does not reflect our cash payments of rent in any year. EBITDA (adjusted) in each year recognises the portion of the rent free credit attributable to such year as if such credit were applied on a straight line basis until the next rent review, normally five years, and recognises the reductions resulting from the CVA in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each year, which more closely aligns to cash payments.| |VI|Like-for-like RevPAR Like-for-like occupancy Like-for-like average room rates|Revenue per available room, occupancy and average room rate (net of VAT) for UK hotels that have been open for at least two years at the end of the current year on a management reporting period basis.

The global pandemic has had a significant impact on the hotel sector, with the Group‟s hotels being closed for a significant period during 2020 and 2021 to date. The Group entered into a CVA in June 2020, as part of which it negotiated a significant rent reduction of £140m to the end of 2021, fully drew down on its existing facilities other than the £30m letter of credit facility, obtained additional funding and took advantage of government support schemes as outlined in note 2. The Group agreed covenant waivers on pre-existing financial covenants until September 2021 and agreed revised covenant terms with its lenders. The revised revolving credit facility introduces a £10m minimum liquidity covenant for the period of the net leverage covenant waiver and the new super senior facility also has the £10m minimum liquidity covenant and a new minimum EBITDA covenant, tested from June 2022.In light of the ongoing global pandemic, there remain significant uncertainties over the short term in respect of the impact that this will continue to have on the group and the wider industry in which it operates. ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) Management‟s basis of preparation in note 2 to the financial statements sets out the key assumptions in respect of both the base case and severe but plausible downside forecasts. In respect of the base case, this currently forecasts sufficient liquidity for the going concern period, however it is sensitive to the timing of the easing of government restrictions and the speed of recovery of demand for hotel accommodation as well as any further increases in government restrictions as a result of Covid-19, including further lockdowns in the going concern period. In the event of any of these downsides transpiring then changes to the minimum liquidity or leverage covenants and further liquidity may be required in December 2021, or earlier if there is a combination of factors or a longer lockdown as detailed in the severe but plausible downside scenarios outlined in note 2. These conditions, along with other matters explained in note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group‟s and company‟s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the group and company were unable to continue as a going concern. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors‟ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. _Audit procedures performed_ Our evaluation of the directors‟ assessment of the group‟s and company‟s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: - obtaining the Directors' paper and supporting models that support the assessment and conclusions with respect to the going concern status of the group and company; and - evaluating the Directors‟ assessment of the estimated speed of recovery of demand for hotel accommodation and the potential impact of further government restrictions as a result of Covid-19 including further lockdowns, changes to the timing of contractual cash flows, and the ability of the group to manage costs, agreeing to evidence where available and ensuring they align to our understanding of the business. In assessing the impact of the scenarios referred to in note 2 of the financial statements we performed the following procedures on the Directors‟ assessment that the group and company will continue as a going concern: - agreed the underlying cash flow projections to management approved forecasts, and assessed how these forecasts are compiled; - checked the mathematical accuracy of the spreadsheet used to model future financial performance; - assessed the accuracy of management‟s forecasts by reviewing historical performance against budget, current year to date performance and bookings and in the context of third-party industry and analysts‟ reports where available; - applied appropriate sensitivities to the growth projections where required; - assessed the impact of the mitigating factors available to management in respect of reducing cash flows over the going concern period; - reviewed loan agreements and terms and ensured covenant calculations were in line with the agreements and determined in what circumstances there was a risk that the covenants may be breached; and - assessed whether the disclosures in the financial statements reflect the going concern assessment and adequately explain the material uncertainty. ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. ###### Our audit approach",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors‟ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to UK tax legislation, Health and Safety Executive legislation, Employment Law, Data Protection Regulation, VAT laws and implementation of government support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management‟s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate reported results and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures we performed included: ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) - Evaluating management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities; - Making enquiries with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; - Reviewing Board meeting and other minutes to identify any non-compliance; - Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in significant accounting estimates; - Specific work around the use of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as outlined in the key audit matter below; - Considering the application of the changes in VAT rates throughout the year and discussing the tax position with the Group‟s tax advisors, specifically in relation to the recoverability of deferred tax assets; and - Testing unusual or unexpected journal entries, particularly those impacting revenue. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to going concern, described in the Material uncertainty related to going concern section above, we determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. The Covid 19 pandemic is a new key audit matter this year. Key judgements and estimates relating to the first-time adoption of IFRS 16, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because this is the second year since the adoption of IFRS 16 and instead the focus is on the subsequent measurement and valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities on new leases and modification of the leases. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year. ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) |Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter| |---|---| |Valuation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on new leases and modification of the leases (group) Refer to pages 12, 18, 66, 67, 69, 72, 86, 87, 90 and 91 for management‟s disclosure. The adoption of IFRS 16 in the prior year introduced a heightened risk that the valuation of lease assets and liabilities may be incorrectly accounted for or valued at inception or when modified. The Group has £2.1 billion of Right of Use (ROU) assets as at 31 December 2020. During the year the Group entered a CVA arrangement which meant that there were a number of lease modifications to account for. Whilst management implemented a lease accounting and management system in the prior year on adoption of the new standard the rent amendments agreed as part of the CVA were extensive and management had to manually calculate the impact on the carrying value of assets and associated liabilities. The discount rate and lease extension or termination options are the key subjective areas requiring management‟s judgement.|In assessing this risk we performed the following procedures: ● Considered the findings from our testing of the IFRS 16 first time adoption carried out in 2019, including the use of management‟s lease accounting system and the accuracy and completeness of the data used. The rent amendments agreed as part of the CVA were calculated outside of the system using a complex manual spreadsheet. ● Reviewed all new leases, agreeing data points into the calculations; ● Tested the formulae and reperformed calculations within the spreadsheets used; ● Tested a sample of terminated and modified leases and agreed data points to lease documents; ● Reperformed the ROU asset and lease liability calculation and compared our result to the IFRS 16 workings and investigated any material differences; ● Recalculated the related depreciation and finance costs. ● Used valuations specialists to assess the discount rate used to calculate the lease liabilities arising on new leases and from changes due to lease modifications; ● Assessed the judgements made by management in determining the lease term and rental payment profiles and agreed these back to lease agreements; ● Tested manual journals in relation to leases; and ● Evaluated the appropriateness of management‟s disclosures. Based on the evidence obtained, we are satisfied that the accounting for new and modified leases under IFRS 16 and the associated disclosure is appropriate.| ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) |Impairment of fixed and right-of-use assets (group) Refer to pages 71 and 72 for management‟s disclosure. The Group has £2.1 billion of Right of Use (ROU) assets as at 31 December 2020. As a result of the CVA arrangement entered into during the year the Group benefited from rent reductions, which resulted in a lease modification adjustment using a higher discount rate, which led to the right-of-use (ROU) assets and associated lease liabilities being reduced by £394.5m. The Group has treated each of its 586 hotels as individual CGUs in the current year. Historically 123 hotels which were subject to historic sale and leaseback transactions were treated as one CGU based on the fair value assessment at acquisition. Management have undertaken an exercise in the current year to reallocate the valuation of lease premiums across the portfolio, which has enabled them to assess each hotel as a separate CGU. Management have performed a full fixed asset impairment review at the year end date. In 2020, given the recent economic impact of Covid-19, especially on the hospitality sector, a heightened risk exists over the recoverability of the Group‟s fixed assets, including the right-of-use assets. Management performed a value in use assessment by discounting the estimated future trading cash flows from each hotel at a post-IFRS 16 Weighted Average Cost of Capital. As several of the hotels had a value in use below the value of the ROU asset in that review, an impairment charge of £8.8m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. This is in addition to the £394.5m reduction to the ROU asset value and associated lease liability in the year as a result of the CVA as well as other changes to the values such as depreciation, new leases, other modifications and disposals. The cash flow projections and the long term growth and discount rate are the key subjective areas. The underlying cash flow projections carry a high level of uncertainty relating to the estimated speed of recovery of demand for hotel accommodation and the potential impact of further government restrictions as a result of Covid-19.|In assessing this risk we performed the following procedures to test the impairment model prepared by management at the year end date: ● Assessed and challenged management‟s assessment of cash-generating units. We tested management‟s exercise to allocate the lease premiums to individual hotels across the 123 asset portfolio previously treated as one CGU; ● Verified the completeness and accuracy of the data and model, comparing the data to lease agreements and the fixed asset listing for completeness and using digital tools to assess the model mechanics; ● Evaluated the reasonableness of management‟s future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board- approved budgets and 5 year plan as well as to market expectations; ● Challenged management on any market expectations that appeared contrary to their forecasts to understand and validate the reasons for this; ● Assessed the historic forecasting ability demonstrated by management; ● Used PwC Valuations specialists to assess the long term growth rate and discount rate applied in the model; ● Challenged management‟s key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts and challenged in the context of current external market data; ● Performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the value in use; and ● Evaluated the appropriateness of management‟s disclosures. From the above procedures, we confirm that the impairment charge booked in the year is appropriate.| |---|---| ----- # Independent auditors’ report to the members of Thame and London Limited ### Report on the audit of the financial statements (continued) Covid-19 (Group)_ In response to the key areas identified as being The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the significantly impacted by Covid-19, we performed the performance of the Group during FY20.

These measures are not statutory measures in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Group’s debt facilities contain ‘frozen GAAP’ clauses, so additional measures have also been provided on a ‘Before IFRS 16’ basis. We report these measures because we believe it provides both management and other stakeholders with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Group’s businesses. APMs are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. We believe the non-IFRS measures are useful metrics for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt and because they permit investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures internally to track our business performance, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) facilitates operating performance comparisons between years and among other companies in industries similar to ours because it removes the effect of variation in capital structures, taxation, and non- cash depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, which may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items and more closely aligns the recognition of rent free periods and rent reductions in profitability with the corresponding cash impact. Management have used the same key performance measure for many years which deducts an annual rental charge from profit, accounting for rent free periods by spreading these over the period to the next rent review. Management believe this is a useful performance measure as it more accurately reflects the cash impact of the hotel operating leases. In line with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority, we have provided additional information on the APMs used by the Group below, including full reconciliations back to the closest equivalent statutory measure. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,533

(3) Disposals relate to the disposal of assets and the disposal of leases where break clauses were instigated as a direct result of the CVA. Lease adjustments of £305.3m include CVA modifications at 20 June 2020 of £394.4m, since offset by subsequent revisions as a result of landlords exercising their options under the CVA to extend leases, together with other lease adjustments in the normal course of business, mainly rent reviews. Under the terms of the company voluntary arrangement, which was approved on 19 June 2020, the Group benefits from a temporary period of rent reductions for certain assets in the portfolio to the end of 2021 and the landlords of these assets were entitled to enter into extension options in relation to those leases. As the reductions extend beyond 30 June 2021, they do not qualify for the practical expedient as set out by the International Accounting Standards Board and have, therefore, been assessed as modifications. As a result of this treatment as a modification, leases were reassessed based on future projected rent cash flows, together with the impact of any lease extension options entered into, and the discount rates used were also reassessed as at June 2020, when the CVA took effect. This resulted in a total reduction in both the lease liability and right of use asset totalling £394.4m, which comprises the effect of the temporary period of rent reductions of approximately £142.4m, together with the reduction due to the increase in the weighted average discount rate for the affected leases from 7.1% to 9.4%. ----- **THAME AND LONDON LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTINUED) 18** **LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)** Lease liabilities have been discounted at a weighted average discount rate of 8.89% (2019: 7.1%) with a range between 5.0% and 11.0% (2019: 5.5% to 9.1%).

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed above, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through borrowings. The Group borrows at floating rates and uses an interest rate cap to limit the interest paid. £300m of floating rate bonds of £440m are covered by the interest rate cap. Given the Group‟s debt facilities position at 31 December 2020 a small movement in LIBOR will affect the Group‟s interest profile. The Group‟s net profit and cash interest payment would increase or decrease by £1.3m (2019: £1.1m) if LIBOR rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points. Liquidity risks: The Group has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Credit risk: The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. No collateral is held against liquid funds. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.

These measures are not statutory measures in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Group‟s debt facilities contain „frozen GAAP‟ clauses, so additional measures have also been provided on a „Before IFRS 16‟ basis. We report these measures because we believe it provides both management and other stakeholders with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Group‟s businesses. APMs are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. We believe the non-IFRS measures are useful metrics for investors to understand our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt and because they permit investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures internally to track our business performance, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) facilitates operating performance comparisons between periods and among other companies in industries similar to ours because it removes the effect of variation in capital structures, taxation, and non- cash depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, which may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe EBITDA (adjusted) is a useful measure of our underlying operating performance because it excludes the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items and more closely aligns the recognition of rent free periods in profitability with the corresponding cash impact. Management used the same key performance measure for many years which deducts an annual rental charge from profit and accounting for rent free periods by spreading these over the period to the next rent review. Management believe this is a useful performance measure as it more accurately reflects the cash impact of the hotel operating leases.

These adjustments have been reversed to calculate EBITDA (adjusted)[(3)]. The rent payable has reduced due to CVA rent reductions. (2) In many of our leases we receive a rent free period at the beginning of the lease term. Under previous IFRS (IAS 17), the benefit of this rent free period is recognised gradually over the life of the lease in our income statement as a deduction to the actual rent expense in each period, on a straight line basis, over the full life of each lease, with the unrecognised balance being held as an accrual on our balance sheet. Similarly, any credit relating to the rent reductions resulting from the CVA is also recognised on a straight line basis over the remaining life of each lease. As a result, our total IFRS rent expense does not reflect our cash payments of rent in any period. EBITDA (adjusted) in each period recognises the portion of the rent free credit attributable to such period as if such credit were applied on a straight line basis until the next rent review, normally five years, which is the measure used for internal management reporting and recognises the credit attributable to reductions resulting from the CVA in line with the actual rent paid in respect of each period. The rent phasing adjustment reflects the timing difference between the rent charge for the period in our internal management reporting measure EBITDA (adjusted) and the rent charge for the period under IAS 17.
