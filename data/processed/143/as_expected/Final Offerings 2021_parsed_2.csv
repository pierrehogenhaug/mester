In addition to the design and assembly of machinery, we also provide After-Sales products and services throughout the lifecycle of the machinery that we sell. We attribute our success, in part, to our unique asset-light business model, which relies on our strong core labor-intensive capabilities in research, design, development, engineering and testing, while outsourcing lower valueadded aspects of the assembly process to a group of select local suppliers. We have made significant investments in research and development to enable us to remain at the forefront of machine customization and product innovation. At the same time, we have fostered a diverse network of local suppliers, many of whom we own minority stakes in, and have tightly integrated these suppliers with our operations, thereby enabling us to maintain low capital expenditure levels and a highly variable cost base. Founded in 1961 and headquartered in Bologna, Italy, an area known for the presence of wellestablished manufacturing companies and a talented engineering labor force, we have 45 manufacturing facilities and approximately 6,000 employees, out of whom approximately 70.0% are engineers and highly specialized technicians, in nine countries, including Italy, the United States, China, Argentina, Germany and Switzerland. We sell our products worldwide to a loyal blue-chip customer base, both directly through our on-the-ground salesforce and, in selected markets, third party agents. We have historically been able to build long-lasting customer relationships by creating highly customized and specialized products with shorter lead times due to our flexible supply chain. Our loyal blue-chip customer base allows us to achieve stable and highly visible revenue, and we generated the majority of our revenue in the last five fiscal years from our existing customers, mainly through new machine orders and After-Sales products and services. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated revenue from contracts with customers of €1.6 billion, EBITDA of €291.8 million (representing an EBITDA Margin of 18.2%) and net profit of €119.3 million, and in 2019, we generated revenue from contracts with customers of €1.6 billion, EBITDA of €273.4 million (representing an EBITDA Margin of 17.1%) and net profit of €169.6 million. We also have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects, with a Backlog as of September 30, 2020 of €919.4 million. Within the global packaging machinery industry, we primarily serve the consumer (including food and beverage), pharmaceutical and tobacco packaging machinery reference markets. We generally 1 ----- operate in niches within these reference markets that we believe are highly resilient and fast growing, and we maintain a leadership position in many of them.

These trends have led to the niches in which we operate in our two largest reference markets, the consumer (including food and beverage) and pharmaceuticals packaging machinery markets, to grow, in terms of revenue, at a compound annual growth rate of 4.0% and 5.4% respectively, from 2014 to 2019. During the same period, our revenue from our corresponding Tea, Coffee, & Other and Pharmaceutical business segments has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.0% and 7.7%, respectively. The niches in which we operate within the consumer and pharmaceuticals packaging machinery markets are projected to continue to grow, in terms of revenue, at a compound annual growth rate of 3.9% and 5.7%, respectively, between 2020 and 2024, in line with recent trends. In addition, revenue from the next-generation products niche in the tobacco packaging machinery market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% from 2019 to 2024. The resiliency of our reference markets has been demonstrated by the historical evolution of capital expenditures in the respective end markets despite past economic downturns. Capital expenditures in the pharmaceutical end market have steadily increased since 2001, rising from less than €100.0 billion globally in 2001 to over €200.0 billion in 2019. During the financial crisis of 2008, capital expenditures in the pharmaceutical end market declined by approximately 7.0%, and then, in 2009, quickly bounced back with growth of 17.0% globally. Capital expenditures in the consumer end market have been even more resilient, steadily increasing since 2001 from about €150.0 billion globally in 2001 to more than €500.0 billion in 2019. During the aforementioned financial crisis, capital expenditures in the consumer end market declined by only approximately 1.0% before returning to 4.0% growth in 2009. This resilient growth is driven, in part, by the fact that packaging machinery plays a key role in both driving customers’ revenue growth and keeping their costs down. This is illustrated by a recent survey indicating that customers are usually driven by one or more of a limited number of considerations: 48.0% of customers seek to replace equipment and increase productivity, 43.0% seek to increase capacity, 34.0% seek to use the machinery for new product introductions and 28.0% seek to introduce new package formats. In addition, since most customers operate their machinery around the clock, minimizing downtimes is critical to their business as evidenced by a recent market survey, according to which, quality and reliability are the most important purchasing criteria for customers of packaging machinery. The ability to drive revenue growth, keep costs down and the overriding need for quality and reliability, support the view that packaging machinery and the related After-Sales products and services are non-discretionary expenditures for customers and lead to demand resiliency for such products and services in any market cycle. While it is difficult to predict the consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that it may accelerate many of the trends that have historically benefitted our business segments and driven sales of our products and services. In particular, we expect to benefit from (i) a higher focus on health care and well-being due to increased consumption of pharmaceuticals, which in turn increases demand for products, (ii) the acceleration of the trend related to product safety concerns due to further increases in private and governmental interest in labelling and traceability of products and (iii) the acceleration of the trend related to factory automation in order to reduce personnel costs and human interaction which can contribute to the spread of disease, including Covid-19. We believe that our presence in non-cyclical end markets with long-term secular growth trends can help us enjoy continued consistent growth in revenue and profits.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Although the overall global packaging machinery industry is highly fragmented, with over 1,000 participants, we claim 3 ----- market leadership in multiple niches in each of our reference markets. Within the pharmaceuticals packaging machinery market, we are a leader in seven niches (blister, capsule filling, tableting, coating, filling, counters and freeze dryers), while our closest competitor is a leader in only three niches. Similarly, in the consumer packaging machinery market, we are the market leader and we estimate our market share to be approximately 76.0%, 40.0% and 15.0% by revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, in the tea, dairy and coffee capsule niches, respectively. In the tobacco packaging machinery market, we are the leader in the “heat not burn” niche, which relates to electronic devices that contain tobacco leaves rather than liquids. Furthermore, we have a strong market leadership and know-how in designing, assembling and testing highly automated machines across all niches we address (i.e. medical devices, vision care, caps & closures, e-motors, e-cigarette, watch making, electro-mechanic, printing and industrial). Our key reference markets, tea, food and other and pharmaceutical packaging machinery markets, are characterized by three main barriers to entry—reputation and quality, technological capabilities and service as illustrated in the chart below. Within these reference markets and the niches in which we compete, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily through (i) the scale and breadth of our product and service offerings, (ii) our large, high-quality, and loyal existing customer base, which includes leading pharmaceutical and consumer products companies, (iii) our wide geographic coverage, (iv) our long history and experience in the business, (v) our best-in-class technology, and (vi) our unique, flexible supply chain that drives superior delivery times. We maintain our technological excellence by investing in research and development. We’ve invested over €80.0 million per year on research and development from 2017 to 2019. Our R&D team has a long track record for innovation and has developed over 1,700 patents. This engineering excellence also enables us to deliver highly-customized products which can command higher profit margins. We have also fostered a diverse and collaborative network of suppliers, many of whom we own minority stakes in. The tight integration of these suppliers with our operations has enabled us to centralize procurement and enterprise resource planning systems, and provides us with higher operational flexibility, lower delivery time, and a more variable cost base, each of which is a significant competitive advantage.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Our After-Sales business is characterized by recurring and stable revenue, and higher margins. It has historically grown in line with our installed base of original equipment, which presents us with regular opportunities to supply our customers with replacement parts and services. From 2016 to 2019, our 4 ----- After-Sales business has consistently represented between 29.0% and 31.0% of our revenue, growing in line with our expanding installed base of machinery. Furthermore, thanks to its higher profitability, compared to our Original Equipment business, the After-Sales business has represented, on average, 43.0% of the total gross profit over the same period. The resilience in the After-Sales business is due to the overriding need of customers to avoid downtime, leading to predictable expenditure on spare parts and maintenance (including predictive maintenance) and our ability to deliver After-Sales services remotely. We believe this was evident in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, where revenue from the After-Sales business were seemingly unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and represented 34.0% of our revenue. We also have high visibility of revenue from our Original Equipment business due to our fast-growing Backlog and repeat business from our loyal, diverse and highly-recurring blue-chip customers. Our Backlog has grown from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%, with our Backlog as of December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 equaling €649.9 million, €766.2 million, €806.8 million, €941.5 million, and €909.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2020 our Backlog was €919.4 million. This substantial and increasing Backlog provides several key benefits, including: (i) future visibility of revenue (e.g., we estimate that our backlog as of September 30, 2020 provided approximately nine months of visibility of revenue); (ii) increasing revenue coverage for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, our Backlog as of the end of the year represented between 70.0% and 84.0% of the next year’s revenue (i.e., from 2016 to 2019) from contracts with customers; (iii) upfront non-refundable cash payments (up to 30.0% of our order value is paid upfront by customers, thus locking in future revenue and strongly disincentivizing customers from cancelling their orders); and (iv) an optimally budgeted cost base, tailored in advance on expected future production, thus allowing flexibility in economic or business downturns. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes several blue-chip customers, including AstraZeneca plc, Novartis International AG, Pfizer Inc., Nestlé S.A., Unilever, Alcon, ThermoFischer, GSK, Porsche, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, Rolex, Tetra Pak and Merck, many of whom have been our customers for more than 20 years. Our customers are also spread out geographically, with Italy, the Rest of Europe, Asia & Middle East, North America and the Rest of the World accounting for 12.1%, 35.1%, 22.2%, 19.7% and 10.9% respectively, of the revenue in 2019. These repeat customers provide us with highly recurring revenue from both After-Sales and the Original Equipment sales. For example, within our pharmaceutical segment, while new customers are acquired each year, a large and increasing volume of our sales are derived from existing customers. As a result, our financial results demonstrate solid resiliency to economic cycles on the back of strong repeating business.

We are well positioned to offer such a solution thanks to our scale and breadth of offerings supported by a unique supply chain ecosystem and route density for sales and After-Sales products and services. Collaborating with our integrated supplier network gives us higher operational flexibility, lower delivery time, and a more variable cost base, as well as centralized scale procurement, and share enterprise resource planning systems. Once our highly customized machinery is installed, our longstanding customer base depends on the quality, scale, and breadth of our After-Sales business to maintain and upgrade the machinery.

We intend to further strengthen these offerings by selling to markets that display multiple attractive competitive dynamics. Our product filling/production machinery are used by companies in the pharmaceutical (across solid forms / pills, and liquid forms /injectables, etc.), tobacco (e.g., e-cigarette parts), and automation/ e-motor production industries. To those companies, we address key purchaser criteria by offering a large number of possible processes and niche machines, customization, an attractive cost per unit, and reliability. This market is attractive to us because it offers high margins, values innovation, has very loyal customers, features many niches and has a highly fragmented competitive landscape. Our primary packaging machinery are used by companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods (e.g., coffee capsules, tea bags, vacuum sealed bags, flex wrapping for food, etc.), and tobacco (e.g., traditional and e-cigarettes) end markets. To those companies, we address key purchaser criteria by offering reliability (particularly in sterile pharmaceutical lines); flexibility for changes to shapes, sizes, and quick changeovers; customization; production speed; and working with limited production space. This market is attractive to us because it (i) offers high margins, (ii) has limited competition, (iii) has repeat customers, (iv) is at the heart of packaging operations, and (v) has relatively complex machinery. We intend to maintain our focus on our two core offerings and leadership in niche markets that we believe will lead to continued high margins and increased revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

We have successfully completed several strategic acquisitions since 2003. These acquisitions were made at attractive multiples that fueled historical growth, on top of strong organic growth. The acquisitions helped us acquire expertise that would be more difficult or require a longer time to develop in-house and allowed us to diversify our product portfolio, offer more integrated solutions, and expand geographically. We intend to maintain our efforts on acquisitions that directly or indirectly expand our presence and sales. By increasing our presence, we would be able to further serve our long-standing customers in those regions.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Our Strategies,9.9.4,Focus R&D investments on automation and materials handling,"R&D and innovation are at the core of our value proposition to customers. We intend to focus on maintaining our leading position at the forefront of technological advancement in our market. To do so, we plan to continue investing in our R&D activity and maintain around 5.0% of our revenue investment in R&D each year. We believe these investments will pay off as we can exploit market demand that is less price-sensitive, but rather is focused on improvements in technology and time-to-market. We will continue focusing a substantial part of our R&D resources on automation, which we believe will be driven by both changing working habits and new working regimes following the Covid-19 pandemic, which include, but are not limited to, increased remote working. Automation and digitalization are driving machine complexity across all end markets, through increased inclusion of sensors and software as a means to increase machine productivity. In addition, health and safety measures on production lines have led to changes in machinery requirements as businesses adapt to new workspace regulations. We believe our leading position in producing fully automated production lines across a range of end markets, our reputation for quality and innovation, as well as our longstanding relationships with blue-chip customers, positions us to take advantage of these developments. We also intend to dedicate R&D resources to the fast-growing materials handling niche market. Materials handling is the short-distance movement of items within a facility. It is driven largely by 7 ----- e-commerce, which, in many cases, requires fast and efficient movement of items from inventory to distribution vehicles. We believe that dedicating R&D resources to this niche market can provide substantial returns as the need for such machinery continues to grow, especially during and following the Covid-19 pandemic. We will also continue dedicating R&D resources to meet the growing demand for sustainable products stemming from changes in consumer preferences and government regulation. Sustainable products generally feature new packaging materials and formats (e.g., bottle caps that remain attached to bottles, or thinner plastics that require more intricate machinery). Customers typically need new machinery to use these sustainable materials or produce the products. We believe the trend towards sustainable products will continue and we intend to position ourselves to take advantage of this trend by investing in the relevant R&D resources. We also intend to invest internally by employing more engineers and highly specialized technicians and increasing our innovation efforts, for example generating new ideas about packaging that we can propose to customers and enhancing the performance of our machines to make them more competitive on the market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

As part of this strategy, our management intends to continue its focus on profitability, disciplined working capital management, and targeted capital spending. Consistent with our historical performance, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to growth by exploiting the favorable trends in our industry and adopting a selective acquisition strategy.

From 1963, we steadily expanded our product and service offerings through a combination of in-house development and acquisitions. In 1967, we began the production of automatic tea bagging machines, a product for which we are now the market leader. Nearly a decade later, in 1976, we began the production of automatic machines for the packaging of pharmaceutical products by launching our blister packaging machine, thereby expanding our operations to another business segment. During the 1980s, we expanded our geographical presence to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States and Austria with the aim of strengthening our distribution networks. In addition, we continued our growth strategy by completing several bolt-on acquisitions in the Pharmaceutical segment, including CMS, Zanasi, Farmatic, Farmomac, PM System, Cestind and WinPack. After an additional two decades of sustained growth, in 1995 we listed our shares on the Milan Stock Exchange. Since 2001, we have been listed on the STAR (prime quality stocks) segment of the Milan Stock Exchange. The Vacchi family continues to own a controlling equity interest. The listing helped us fund our expansion plan and reinforce our position as a global player through acquisitions in Italy, Germany and India, along with establishing a presence in China and Japan. In addition, the transformation into a public company prompted management to modernize our internal organization, with a view to ensuring sustainable growth. Since the late 2000s, we continued to acquire companies with the goal of acquiring technological capabilities and organize the company to become a leader in its key business segments. In 2008, we acquired the freeze-drying machinery business of the BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems Group, a leader in that market with operations in the Netherlands, the United States, and China. In 2010, we acquired GIMA S.p.A., based near Bologna, Italy, which operated in the automation, coffee, confectionary, personal care, and tobacco markets. In 2011, we acquired Sympak Corazza Group, a 8 ----- dairy and convenience food packaging company, to give us greater exposure to those growing markets. In 2012, we implemented a new organizational structure with two main brands: IMA Industries (machines for the packaging of tea, coffee, food and cosmetic products) and IMA Pharma (machines for the processing and packaging of pharmaceutical products). In 2013, we acquired ILAPAK Group, based in Switzerland, to gain exposure to the flexible packaging business. In 2016, we enhanced our product line and our global presence through the acquisition of the Medtech business of Komax Group, which has plants in Switzerland, the United States, and Malaysia. In 2017, we listed GIMA TT S.p.A. (“GIMA TT”), our subsidiary specialized in packaging for next generation tobacco products, on the Milan Stock Exchange, but, in 2019, we merged with GIMA TT, delisted it and made it the foundation of our Tobacco segment. In 2018, we acquired Tissue Machinery Company (“TMC”), a manufacturer of tissue and personal care products. In 2019, we acquired ATOP, a leading company in industrial automation for the production of electric motors for E-traction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

In 2020, our results were unusually strong in the third quarter, likely due to the extraordinary circumstances related to the Covid-19 emergency and our continued work throughout August, and we completed several projects in our Backlog at that time rather than at the end of the year. This additional summary activity will therefore result in our fourth quarter revenues being lower than what we have realized in prior years.

As a result of such over-thecounter purchases, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer indirectly owns approximately 66.82% of the Outstanding Company Shares, which represents voting power sufficient to approve the Delisting Merger at a shareholder meeting. In addition to our above holdings, certain related parties own an additional 381,069 shares, representing approximately 0.88% of the Outstanding Company Shares, which we would expect to purchase. Furthermore, on November 18, 2020, Hydra S.p.A.

The MTO offering document is currently under review by CONSOB and it is currently expected that CONSOB will approve the MTO offering document by mid-December 2020, and that the MTO offering period should commence on or about mid-December 2020 and, should this be the case, we expect that the MTO offering period would end on or about mid-January 2021. The MTO is mandatory in nature and to the extent we acquire more than 90.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares, a Delisting by law will occur following the completion of the MTO. The purchase price of the MTO will be €68.00 per share (the “MTO Price”), which represents a premium of 26.3% and 20.8% over the average trading price of the Company’s shares over the past month and six months, respectively, in each case of the announcement of the transaction on July 28, 2020. The public price per share of the Company’s shares was €67.85 as of December 3, 2020 according to Borsa Italiana.

If, as a result of the MTO and/or the Sell-Out, IMA Bidco comes to own at least 95.0% of the share capital of the Company, IMA Bidco will be granted a right, pursuant to Article 111, paragraph 1 of the Italian Finance Law, to purchase from minority shareholders all of their residual shares in the Company and, simultaneously, it will have an obligation, pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1 of the Italian Finance Law, to purchase, by any minority shareholders making a request to such effect, their residual shares in the Company (“Squeeze-Out”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Following the Completion Date: - should the Issuer acquire 100.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares in the context of the MTO (including the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out), the Issuer intends to consummate the Company Merger. “Company Merger” means the merger of the Issuer, IMA Bidco and the Company on terms complying with Articles 2501-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code (the surviving entity of the Company Merger being “Company MergerCo”) following the acquisition of 100.0% of the shares in the Company pursuant to the MTO (including the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out). - should the Issuer not acquire 100.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares, in the context of the MTO (including the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out) and regardless of the number of Outstanding Company Shares that the Issuer will acquire, the Company intends to complete the Delisting Merger. “Delisting Merger” means the merger of IMA Bidco and the Company (the surviving entity of the Delisting Merger being “Delisting MergerCo”). Following completion of the Delisting Merger, the Issuer may complete the Debt Push Company Merger. “Debt Push Company Merger” means the merger of the Delisting MergerCo and the Issuer (the surviving entity of the Merger being the “Debt Push MergerCo”) on terms complying with Articles 2501-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code as soon as reasonably practicable, following completion of the Delisting Merger in the event we own 100.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares. To the extent that the Debt Push Company Merger does not occur because we do not own 100.0% of Outstanding Company Shares, the Issuer will have access only to its proportionate share of any dividends or distributions from the Company for purposes of making payments under the Notes, there may be limits to the degree of control the Issuer can exercise over the Company due to the continued presence of minority shareholders and the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any future third party debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. However, the Issuer intends to lend a portion of the proceeds of the Notes to the Company to repay the existing financial indebtedness of the Company (excluding finance 11 ----- leases), and the Issuer will provide security interests in such proceeds loans in favor of the Notes. See below, “—The Refinancing”.

In this case, the liquidation value of the shares subject to withdrawal would be determined pursuant to Italian law, with exclusive reference to the average of the closing prices in the six months preceding the publication of the notice of the shareholders meeting at which the resolutions approving the Delisting Merger were adopted. _Delisting and Delisting Merger_ Based on market reaction to date and the strong interest in sales of further Outstanding Company Shares to IMA Bidco outside of the MTO, the Issuer expects a strong uptake in the MTO. Further, IMA Bidco may continue to purchase shares over-the-counter outside of the MTO. While the Issuer expects a strong uptake in the MTO, other than under the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out, the ability to tender is purely voluntary for existing shareholders and the Issuer cannot provide any assurances on the uptake of the MTO. For illustrative purposes, even in the event that the Issuer was to acquire no further Outstanding Company Shares and therefore continue to own only 66.82% of the Outstanding Company Shares, the Issuer would intend to proceed in the following manner: - to pursue the Delisting via the Delisting Merger, for which the Issuer has sufficient voting power at its current shareholding under Italian law, but which is subject to certain other conditions; and - in any event, IMA Bidco will utilize no less than €930.0 million of proceeds of the Notes to (i) refinance amounts already drawn under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement, (ii) lend money to the Company to repay the existing financial indebtedness of the Company (excluding finance leases), and (iii) pay certain transactions fees and expenses and provide cash available for working capital and balance sheet purposes to the Company. See “Use of _Proceeds.”_ Purchases of Company shares, which utilize proceeds of the Notes held in escrow, will be funded via a combination of such proceeds of the Notes held in escrow and equity contributed to IMA Bidco such that following the proportion of equity contribution to the amount of proceeds released from escrow for such purpose will be at least 76.4%. Each of the Company Merger, the Delisting Merger and the Debt Push Company Merger are subject to certain conditions and may not be completed or may take several months to finalize given the required legal processes.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in these markets are service quality, technical and industry expertise, established relationships with key customers (often on a local level), knowledge of the regulatory framework, and fast customer service. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our market share in the face of competition. We anticipate that we will continue to face threats from our existing competitors, which could decide to consolidate their positions through mergers, joint ventures or other forms of commercial agreements. As a result, we may face competition from groups who benefit from greater economies of scale or have greater financial, marketing, technological or other resources, know-how, size and assembly capacity, larger customer bases and better-established reputations and customer relationships in our markets than we do, as well as a worldwide presence that is more extended and diversified than our own. Such groups may be able to, among other things, more efficiently or more rapidly develop superior services or solutions, gain greater market acceptance and expand their service offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and devote greater resources to the research and development of their services and solutions. Established or new competitors may further develop their current products and technologies or create alternative ones that are more appealing, due to price, quality or other factors, than our products. As a 37 ----- result, we may not be able to supply customers with services that they deem superior at competitive prices and we may lose market share to our competitors.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"We could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property, technological know-how and trademarks and there is a risk that we might infringe or be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others.","Our products are highly dependent upon our technological know-how. As of December 31, 2019, we held over 1,700 patents and we continue to invest significantly in research and development activities. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. In principle, we monitor and seek to protect to the fullest extent our ownership of inventions that result from our research and development department, but we may not always be successful in claiming and defending the ownership of our intellectual property. Furthermore, patents may not be granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. For example, certain items cannot be protected at all which are integral to our breakthroughs, such as trade secrets. Trade secrets and know-how that cannot effectively be safeguarded through patent registration, as well as other unpatented proprietary know-how, might be disclosed to third parties. Additionally, our proprietary software constitutes significant intellectual property which is not disclosed and typically not secured by patents. As a result, a part of our know-how is not patented and is not protected through intellectual property rights. While there is a presumption that patents that are granted are valid, the granting of a patent does not necessarily imply that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired. In particular, intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in Asia and other regions, since the application and enforcement of laws governing such rights in these regions may adhere to different standards than in Italy. And even when they are protective, enforcing our rights under patents in the courts can be time consuming and costly, or we may be unable to detect the misappropriation immediately. If a patent does not provide meaningful protection or we are unable to detect misuse of our know-how, either because it is invalid or ineffective, there is the risk that competitors may copy our know-how without incurring any expenses of their own through the misappropriation by employees, contractors or third parties. In addition, some of our patented innovations might be subject to claims against their registration. Public disclosure may be required as part of these claims, which may enable competitors to apply for corresponding patents in jurisdictions abroad and/or use our know-how to develop competing machinery. Furthermore, we rely to a limited extent on trademarks in order to protect our brands. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to protect our trademarks in the future. If our trademarks cannot be adequately protected, this could hinder or completely eradicate our market reputation, significantly impairing our competitiveness. In the future, we may rely on licenses granted by third parties, which may expire, be declared invalid or be terminated for reasons beyond our control and then be granted to competitors. If we are unable to substitute such licenses, we might have to either terminate the operations affected by the licenses or invest significant financial resources in other business areas to off-set these losses. The markets in which we operate are characterized by regular claims and related litigation regarding patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Since our competitors, suppliers and customers also submit a large number of inventions for intellectual property protection, we cannot rule out that other parties may have effective and enforceable intellectual property rights with respect to some of our processes, methods or applications. Thus, there is a potential risk that we could infringe the intellectual property rights of other parties. Accordingly, other parties could assert infringements of intellectual property rights, including illegitimate ones, against us. Successful claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation by another party against us, could prevent us from manufacturing, using or marketing certain technologies or products in certain countries or require us to pay licensing costs, 38 ----- make changes to manufacturing processes and/or products, or litigate the scope or validity of patents in order to be permitted to sell our products. In addition, we could be liable to pay fines or compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of technology from other parties. Any such outcomes, or the expenditure of time and resources to defend against such outcomes, could impair our ability to innovate, develop, distribute and sell our current and planned products and services, which could materially impact our operations. In addition, even claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation that ultimately are unsuccessful could cause reputational harm, result in litigation costs and divert management’s time and other resources. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred research and development expenses of €54.0 million, €55.3 million, €53.9 million and €58.7 million, respectively. As a result, future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to incorporate this research and development into the products and services we offer. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of such research and development for any reason, including increased competition, technology becoming obsolete or lack of acceptance of new products in our target markets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Although we believe we have appropriate insurance coverage in relation to material damage to property and the interruption of manufacturing resulting from natural or accidental events, amongst others, there is no guarantee that such coverage will be sufficient to compensate for damage and costs incurred by us. Additionally, we occasionally relocate manufacturing production and close down facilities or move parts of those facilities to other sites for production efficiency and other reasons. If we are unable to manage such closures and relocations efficiently or effectively, it could lead to disruption in our production capacities and hinder our ability to meet customer needs.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization confirmed that its spread and severity had escalated to the point that it was deemed a pandemic. The outbreak of Covid-19 has resulted in authorities, including those in the countries in which we operate, implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, curfews, lockdowns, quarantines and shutdowns of businesses and workplaces. This has resulted in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and significant worsening of the global macroeconomic outlook. See “—Current economic and financial conditions could negatively impact the _demand for our products and services.”_ 39 ----- The spread of Covid-19 has resulted in a slowdown in manufacturing activity globally in the markets in which we operate due to severe disruptions to supply chain operations and a decline in overall customer demand. This has led us to modify our operational practices required by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and other stakeholders. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of such measures (or their insufficiency) could harm our ability to perform some of our critical functions and serve our customers. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics or adverse public health developments, our operations and those of our subcontractors, customers and suppliers, may experience delays, disruptions and other adverse effects, such as difficulties obtaining components, suspension or reduction of operations, declines in sales activities and orders, difficulties in travel and communications, and regulatory restrictions. The pandemic and related countermeasures have affected and continue to affect some of our customers adversely. In some cases, this may be material which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on us (for example, through deteriorations in credit quality and higher impairments). Moreover, the ability of our customers to serve their contractual obligations may also be materially affected due to liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, schemes have been initiated by national governments to provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak. The actual impact on our customers and, therefore, the impact on us remain uncertain at this stage. The full economic impact of Covid-19 is outside of our control and will depend on the spread of the virus and the response of the local authorities and the global community. The degree to which Covid-19 impacts our results of operations, liquidity, access to funding and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of Covid-19, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, the extent and effectiveness of economic stimulus taken to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly, to what extent normal economic and business activity can resume and the possibility of an additional or extended lockdown. Moreover, even after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to face material adverse effects on our business as a result of its global economic impact, including the depth and duration of any recession or increases in unemployment levels that have occurred or may occur in the future. Any future pandemics or health crises may also have similar, or even more severe, effects on global economic activity and on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. See “—Current _economic and financial conditions could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.”_ Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770
143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.6,Current economic and financial conditions could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.,"Our presence and operations in various international markets exposes us to risks connected, among other things, with both international geo-political and macroeconomic conditions. We are further exposed to the geo-political and macroeconomic conditions of the individual countries in which we operate, as well as any potential variations and changes in their regulatory, monetary, fiscal, and tax regimes. In part, our financial results depend on global economic conditions, specifically in the European Union, the United States, South America, and Asia. A prolonged global recession or a recession in any of these regions, in which we operate, could materially and negatively influence the demand for our products. In addition, slower than expected economic growth in the countries in which we operate may negatively influence our ability to meet our business forecasts. In addition to the global macroeconomic risks highlighted above, we are exposed to the macroeconomic risks in each of the countries in which we produce and sell our products and services. Given the international nature of our activities, we face risks stemming from potential changes in legislation as well as the political and social situations in each of the countries in which we carry out our activities. The possibility of restrictions on the distribution of products or the introduction of customs 40 ----- and general duties may affect, perhaps significantly, our ability to offer our products at economically competitive levels in the countries in which we currently operate or may decide to operate in the future. This risk has increased in recent years as nations in which we operate have disagreed on trade policy, engaging in threats, adverse actions, and retaliatory measures that destabilize business and trade. In some instances, tariffs have been placed on our products. In 2020, following the global spread of Covid-19, the governmental authorities of many countries, including the Italian government, adopted restrictive measures to contain the further spread of the pandemic. Although governmental authorities in most of the countries in which we operate have loosened restrictions in recent months, many restrictions have remained in place and a significant number of these governmental authorities have reimposed restrictions in response to an increasing number of Covid-19 cases. It is not possible to predict the end of the pandemic or how long the restrictions may remain in place as a precaution even once the pandemic has ended. Therefore, it is not possible to predict the further negative effects that the continuation of the pandemic, or the spread of any similar disease, will have on financial markets and economic activities at a domestic and global level.

The overall economic climate in the markets, in which we plan to expand, is subject to periods of volatility and the markets could develop slower than we expect. In addition, some Asian markets are characterized by lower levels of political, legal and economic stability compared to countries in Western Europe, where we have historically concentrated our activities. Furthermore, we may be less familiar than our major competitors with the non-European markets where we intend to expand our operations, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be familiar with the cultural traditions and customs of some of the markets in which we are investing, and our relative lack of experience with the legal framework along with the lack of political or economic influence in those countries could mean that our further expansion cannot be pursued on our desired terms or at all. Additionally, we are subject to further risks resulting from unforeseeable developments in a variety of jurisdictions. These risks include, among other things: - political instability; - armed conflicts in the regions in which we operate or serve our customers; - acts of terrorism and military actions in response to such acts; - unexpected changes in regulatory environments and government interference in the economy; - foreign currency exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds; - inability to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws; - differing permitting and licensing regimes, which may make it difficult to ensure we maintain all appropriate permits and licenses in every country where we operate; - insufficient protection against product piracy and other violations of our intellectual property rights; - the effect of a data breach or significant disruption in our operations as a result of unauthorized access to our information technology networks, such as cyber-attacks; and - difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees, or further rationalizing our workforce. 41 ----- Should our further expansion into international growth markets not be successful or not as successful as planned, or should we not be able to manage our growth effectively, any related investments might not result in the desired growth in revenue and profits.

Moreover, the costs of these components and services are subject to price fluctuations and other factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers. Our assembling process depends on the availability and timely supply of components and semifinished goods that we normally purchase through our purchasing network. The purchasing network consists of a limited number of suppliers with which we have established relationships. There is a risk that we may experience production downtime if one or more suppliers are unable to fulfil delivery obligations. This is especially true if the supplier supplies specialized parts for a custom-built product. The costs and the delivery time of components vary depending on capacity utilization rates of our suppliers, quantities demanded from our suppliers, product technology, and product specification. As a result, the costs of our components can vary materially in the short-term and increase significantly, due to supply shortages or variations in the costs of the raw materials required to make such parts. As raw material costs and freight costs comprise a portion of our costs, the cyclical nature of commodity pricing and freight costs presents a potential risk to our margins. Although we will attempt to pass on cost increases to our customers with higher sales prices, we may not be able to do so in the future. Any price increases we cannot fully pass on to our customers may materially reduce our profitability. Although we seek to maintain relationships with a deep and diverse group of suppliers, we may need to rely on a single supplier for customized components for our products and we might not be able to find an alternative supplier on the market. Any failure to obtain components or other materials or any delay affecting our supply chain could compromise our ability to meet our customers’ needs or to operate at our current production levels. See “—Loss of, limited use of, or relocation of one or more of _our key manufacturing facilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ Should our supply chain management not be successful or not as successful as planned, or should we not be able to manage our supply chain effectively, any related investments might not result in the desired growth in revenue and profits.

Although we can attribute part our total revenue growth to organic growth, we have benefitted from several successful acquisitions that have allowed us to capture synergies and diversify and complete our portfolio of products and services and the regions in which we offer them. We may face challenges in identifying and acquiring businesses and assets that will similarly improve our business. See “—We _may not be able to realize anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with past and future acquisitions and it may be difficult to manage and integrate a continually growing group.”_ Additionally, we may face increased competition if our competitors decide to enter the niche markets in which we operate, which could reduce our competitive and technological advantage.

In particular, we are primarily exposed to exchange risk for exports from the Euro area to regions that use the U.S. dollar. Although a majority of our activities are conducted in Euros, we have significant non-Euro denominated assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 14.4% of our trade receivables were in U.S. dollars and we had trade receivables in Swiss francs, Indian rupees, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, and other currencies. In recent years, these currencies have experienced considerable volatility against the Euro. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into Euro at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period, as applicable. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the Euro against these other currencies will affect the amounts attributed to these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. Given our presence and increasing focus in non-Eurozone markets, this risk may increase over time. In addition, to the extent that we incur expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations could cause our expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability. We attempt to limit exchange risk by engaging in currency hedging. Such attempts to limit risk to exchange rate fluctuations and involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. Moreover, foreign governments may restrict or impose withholding tax on transfers of cash out of the applicable country and may also control exchange rates.

The current management team, led by our CEO, Alberto Vacchi, has overseen the rapid growth of our business, successfully implemented our business plan, and helped make us a market leader. While we seek to retain employees, particularly top management and key personnel, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to retain our management team or our current personnel. Loss of one or more of our managers or of a significant number of specialized and highly trained personnel could have a material adverse effect could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. The competition for highly trained managers and specialized labor force, including engineers and highly specialized technicians, is intense and demand is often hard to meet. Also, the growth of our business may require us to seek additional managers and highly trained personnel, who may be difficult to identify and hire on terms favorable to us.

Changes in customer and consumer preferences, which vary region by region, including the relative demand for environmental sustainability, technological advancements, quality, variety, price point, and lifestyle promoted by our customers’ product offerings, affect both the demand for new products and the volume of product sales therefrom. For example, consumer demand patterns are affected by an increasing sensitivity to environmental sustainability, including preferences against single-use disposable features, which may require us to make changes to our existing products. Furthermore, consumers may not necessarily have the same expectations and preferences across the markets where we currently operate, and adjustments for regional differences present additional challenges. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on the part of our customers to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products. The risks associated with changes in the markets we serve have increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced consumers to change their lifestyles. It is unknown whether these changes in lifestyle as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic will be short-term or permanent. This uncertainty about the trends in consumer preferences may affect our customers’ decisions with respect to acquiring our products and services. See “—The Covid-19 pandemic could have a material adverse _effect on the global economy and our customers, and, in turn, our business results.”_ Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

We have made notable acquisitions since the 1970s, and, in the last decade, we have completed several notable acquisitions, including the acquisitions of GIMA S.p.A. in 2010, Sympak Corazza Group in 2011, Tissue Machinery Company in 2018 and ATOP in 2019. Once we complete an acquisition, we may seek to harness certain operational synergies and cost savings premised upon, among other things, economies of scale, rationalization of headquarters functions, consolidation of manufacturing sites and rationalization of supply chains. However, we may not be able to realize any of the foregoing synergies either in the amount or within the timeframe that we may anticipate, and the costs of achieving any such synergies may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost saving measures may be affected by a number of factors, including increases in expenses related to the relevant acquisition(s), which may offset the cost savings therefrom. Moreover, successful integration and the realization of synergies require, among other things, proper coordination of business development and marketing efforts, retention of key members of management, policies for effective recruitment and training as well as the ability to adapt information and computer systems. Any future acquisition, especially any future material acquisition, could require us to make significant investments or increase our debt. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer base of the businesses that we acquire, generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth and expected synergies. Although we analyze acquisition targets, such assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. There can be no assurance that our assessments of, and assumptions regarding, acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. In most cases, acquisitions involve the integration of a separate business which was previously operated independently, and under different systems and protocols. It is possible that we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our business or that such integration may require more investments than we had expected, or that we may incur unknown or unanticipated liabilities with respect to customers, employees, suppliers or other parties relating to the acquisition. The process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses, or a decrease in our operating results as a result of difficulties or risks, including: - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues; - the loss of key customers or employees; 44 ----- - difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure; - difficulty in realizing operating synergies; - failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that we have historically provided; - failure to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; - added costs of dealing with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; - unforeseen challenges arising from operating in new geographic areas; and - diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties. Furthermore, we operate and acquire businesses in different countries, with different regulatory and operating cultures, which may exacerbate the risks described above, and if we decide to acquire a business in a geographical area where we do not yet operate, such risks could be even more significant in respect of such an acquisition. Any difficulties encountered in combining operations could result in higher integration costs and lower savings or revenues than expected. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired business successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations or our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness could be materially adversely affected. See “—We may not be able to _implement our business strategies or expand into international growth markets and manage future growth effectively.”_ We may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions. We have typically required the sellers in past acquisitions to indemnify us against certain undisclosed liabilities; however, we cannot guarantee that the indemnification rights we have obtained, or will in the future obtain, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions that require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract. Although the agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control” provisions prior to closing of the acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition to closing. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be unable to secure replacements. While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks through contractual protections in our acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. In addition, if we enter into an acquisition agreement but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. From time to time, we may dispose of businesses or assets that we determined were not core to our operations or otherwise decided to sell. Sellers in such transactions are generally required to indemnify the purchasers of businesses for various liabilities, and these indemnification obligations may be significant. Any such obligations to the purchasers of the businesses we sell, and any litigation regarding these obligations, may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business.

As of September 30, 2020, we had intangible assets of 45 ----- €861.5 million, including goodwill of €483.4 million. Intangible assets are initially measured at purchase or production cost. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over our share of the net fair value of those purchased assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that can be identified individually and recognized separately. Goodwill is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Intangible assets other than goodwill, or with a finite useful life, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. At the end of each financial year, and every interim accounting period, where there is any indication that an intangible asset may be impaired, its recoverable amount is calculated pursuant to impairment tests. Since the Covid-19 pandemic constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of impairment (i.e. an impairment indicator), the sustainability of the impairment tests is being assessed also at interim dates. We recognize the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount as impairment loss in the income statement. The amount of impairment losses that we are required to recognize in the future may be significant, particularly in the event of material acquisitions or products that perform below our expectations. There is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The future development of the macroeconomic environment, of the COVID-19 pandemic, unsuccessful acquisitions or other factors could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our customers pay up to 30.0% of the total invoice in the early stages of the relationship by paying the first tranche of the agreed price. New Orders Intake represents the value of orders that are added to our Backlog during a given period and also includes cancellations of work or changes to existing contracts already in our Backlog, and thus helps to illustrate the annual turnover of our Backlog. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had a total Backlog of €919.4 million, €909.0 million, €941.5 million, and €806.8 million, respectively.

With the increasing focus by regulators, the press and our commercial partners on anti-money laundering, bribery and other compliance issues, our internal controls and procedures have even become more important to our business. If our internal controls and procedures are not adequately designed to meet the needs of our business, we may need to incur further costs to re-design and implement new controls or may encounter instances of embezzlement and fraud or to remedy the consequences of system failures. The process by which our internal controls and procedures are implemented may be inadequate to ensure full compliance with such controls and procedures, leaving us vulnerable to inconsistencies and failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. This risk may be increased as a result of our frequent acquisitions. If we fail to maintain or fail to cause the companies we acquire to adopt and maintain adequate internal controls our financial statements may not accurately reflect our financial condition. We may suffer damage resulting from our employees’ or agents’ misconduct, operational errors or negligence, including damage relating to acts or omissions of employees or agents that we engage to provide services and manage client and supplier relationships in certain markets. Such misconduct, errors or negligence may include, for example, inadvertent or careless mistakes or intentional acts or misrepresentations by our employees or agents, breaches of applicable laws or regulations in the course of their duties, breaches of operational guidelines or other improper acts. Our systems designed to prevent and mitigate these risks may fail, and if we fail to train and manage our employees properly, these internal controls and procedures may be ineffective. Any misconduct, operational errors or negligence resulting from our employees or agents could lead to reputational damage, regulatory action, loss of regulatory licenses and financial costs, or penalties that may not be covered by insurance or by another party.

See “Business—IT Systems.” We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security. Information technology system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellations of customer orders, inability to carry out certain After-Sales service activities remotely, loss of customers, impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products, other business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. See “—We could be unsuccessful in _adequately protecting our intellectual property, technological know-how and trademarks and prevent others from making unauthorized use of such rights.” Our information systems could also be_ 49 ----- penetrated by outside parties who intend to extract information, corrupt information, disrupt business processes, or misappropriate our customer information. Such breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among others, our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other business partners, as well as personal data stored on our products or through our services by our customers, which may result in damage to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our customers. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. The risk of such attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, we, our customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.

We strive to set high standards of personal integrity for our employees and maintain high security system for services that we provide to our clients. Our reputation in this regard is an important factor in our business dealings with governmental agencies, our business partners and our customers. Accordingly, a finding of improper conduct on our part, or on the part of one or more of our current or former executives, directors, employees or another related party, or a system security defect or failure, or an allegation of such conduct that impairs our reputation, could result in civil or criminal liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. See “—We may in the future be _involved in legal proceedings, including with regard to our key customers”._ Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 (“Decree 231”) allows Italian corporate entities, such as IMA, to implement compliance procedures to defend themselves against the administrative liability that may attach to them under Decree 231 for crimes committed in their interest or to their advantage by individuals who have a functional relationship with such corporate entities, such as employees, directors and representatives. Organizational, management and control models provide a defense from administrative liability to corporate entities that have implemented a 231 Model in compliance with 50 ----- Decree 231 and have appointed an independent officer or body, such as a supervisory body (Organismo di Vigilanza), to supervise such 231 Model. We have adopted a 231 Model on November 14, 2018. While we are not currently involved in any proceedings pursuant to Decree 231, the adoption of a 231 Model does not in itself exclude the application of sanctions and/or any form of liability under Decree 231, and any failure to update this model increases the risk that administrative liability under Decree 231 may arise. While maintaining, implementing and updating the internal control systems, we may not be able to prevent or detect the commission of the offences covered in Decree 231, especially given the nature and size of our Group. Any proceeding relating to alleged crimes falling within the scope of Decree 231, even if ultimately the proceeding discharges the relevant entity, could be costly and divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business. Any such proceedings may also cause adverse publicity and reputational harm which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Specifically, under Decree 231, we can be held liable for certain offenses committed in our interest or for our benefit in Italy or abroad (e.g., corruption, fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain environmental and workplace safety violations) by persons that have a relationship with us at the time of committing the offense in question, including third-party agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we can demonstrate that such persons intentionally violated our internal control model and that it would have been impossible for us to prevent such breach. If an offense falling within the scope of Decree 231 is committed, we may be subject to administrative or criminal penalties (e.g., fines, confiscations of profits), including the loss or revocation of authorizations, permits and licenses, a prohibition on contracting with public authorities, exclusion from subsidies and loan contributions, a prohibition on publicizing goods or services, the imposition of restrictions on our activities or damage to our reputation, and a consequent decrease in market confidence in our Group.

Furthermore, implementing changes in laws may require us to incur special or additional expenses. In particular, costs to comply with any changes to current regulatory provisions, both initially and on an ongoing basis, may be especially high, and such changes may take a substantial amount of time to implement. In this respect, we have certain sales into Iran and Syria, which are undertaken in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations, which, in the last three years, have in each case accounted for less than 1.0% of total revenue.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”. We anticipate that the Issuer’s high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future and could have material consequences for the holders of the Notes, including: - making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its debt obligations, including under the Notes; - increasing the Issuer’s vulnerability and reducing its flexibility to respond to a downturn in its business or economic and industry conditions; - limiting the Issuer’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings; - placing the Issuer at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow; - requiring the Issuer to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund its operations acquisitions, product research and development, or other general corporate purposes; - limiting the Issuer’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business, the competitive environment and the industry in which it operates; and - restricting the Issuer from investing in customer acquisitions, growing its business, pursuing strategic acquisitions and exploiting certain business opportunities.

Many of these factors are beyond the Issuer’s control. If the Issuer cannot service its indebtedness and meet its other obligations and commitments, it might be required to refinance its debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. The Issuer cannot assure you that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of the Issuer’s debt instruments.

The Issuer’s failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of events beyond its control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect the Issuer’s financial condition and results of operations. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Guarantee Facility and the Indenture contain negative covenants restricting, among other things, the Issuer’s ability to: - make certain loans or investments; - incur indebtedness or issue guarantees; - sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock; - merge or consolidate with other companies; - transfer all or substantially all of its assets; - pay dividends and make other restricted payments; - create or incur liens; - agree to limitations on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions; and - enter into transactions with affiliates. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. The Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to meet these covenants, can be affected by events beyond its control and a breach could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which, subject to applicable cure periods or other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could declare amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. The restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Guarantee Facility, the Indenture and certain other of the Company and its subsidiaries’ indebtedness, could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.

This, in turn, depends on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If the Issuer cannot generate sufficient cash to meet its debt service requirements, the Issuer may, among other things, need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments, or sell material assets. If the Issuer is not able to refinance any of its debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its debt obligations, including the Notes. If the Issuer is also unable to satisfy its obligations on other financing arrangements, the Issuer could be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Guarantee Facility, the Indenture and other relevant financing agreements which the Issuer may enter into in the future. In the event of a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Guarantee Facility or certain other defaults under any other agreement, the lenders under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including terminating their commitments and declaring all amounts that the Issuer has borrowed under its credit facilities and other indebtedness to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Such a default, or a failure to make interest payments on the Notes, could mean that borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. If the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility or the Notes or any other material financing arrangement that the Issuer has entered into or will subsequently enter into were to be accelerated, its assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in full. Any such actions could force the Issuer into bankruptcy or liquidation, and the Issuer might not be able to repay its obligations under the Notes in such an event. Also, any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of the Issuer’s credit rating, which could also harm the Issuer’s ability to incur additional indebtedness. Any refinancing of the Issuer’s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Issuer to comply with more onerous covenants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

A further deduction of interest expenses in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30 percent of fiscal EBITDA (i.e. _risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”) determined according to the tax rules for_ the calculation of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL and of interest income exceeding the interest expenses not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward, respectively for the following five fiscal years and without time limits. Interest expenses not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expenses that exceeds interest income is lower than 30 percent of ROL (utilized on the basis of the FIFO method). The carried forward ROL determined according to accounting rules under the previously applicable limitation provision could be offset only with interest expenses incurred on loans granted before 17 June 2016, to the extent that their maturity and their total amount committed have not been changed as of that date. In the case of a tax group, interest expenses not deducted by an entity within the tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies within the tax group. 59 ----- Based on the above rules, the Issuer (or the Group) may not be able to deduct for Italian tax purposes all interest expenses borne in each relevant fiscal year. Furthermore, any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application, including any possible further limitation to the use of the ROL of the Issuer and/or of the Group may result in the Issuer’s inability to fully deduct its interest expenses or further reduce the amount which it can deduct. In the past, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leveraged buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on an acquisition bank loan in leveraged buyout (“LBO”) transactions are generally deductible for the Italian corporate income tax (“IRES”) purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency confirmed as a general principle that LBO transactions are generally based on sound economic reasons considering that the financing from third party lenders is usually conditional on acquisition of control over the target company by a special purpose vehicle and the following merger with debt push down. As a result of such guidance, LBO transactions are generally not considered irregular for tax purposes absent specific circumstances in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g., re-leveraged transactions without a change of control).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

We raise funds using debt and investing excess liquidity in money market and other financial instruments. The fluctuation of market interest rates influences the cost and returns of the debt and investment instruments, therefore affecting our net financial income. We manage a significant portion of our interest rate risk on floating rate indebtedness by means of derivative financial instruments (for example interest rate swaps). While we believe that our hedging policy limits our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, there can be no guarantee that our hedging policy, which is designed to minimize any losses connected to fluctuations in interest rates, in the case of floating rate indebtedness, by transforming them into fixed rate indebtedness, will actually have the effect of reducing any such losses. To the extent it does not, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Notes, as certain of the Issuer’s borrowings (including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility) bear, and the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing the Issuer’s interest cost and reducing cash flow. A substantial part of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, bears or will bear interest at per annum rates equal to EURIBOR (subject to a 0.0% floor), in each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing the Issuer’s interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent the Issuer from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when the Issuer is required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

As a result, the Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, intercompany loans, or otherwise to make payments on the Notes. IMA Bidco owns 66.82% of the Outstanding Company Shares, and the Issuer will have a right to receive only such proportion of dividends declared equal to its shareholdings. The Issuer’s operating subsidiaries may not generate cash flow sufficient to enable the Issuer to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to the Issuer under some circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under Italian corporate law which require a company to retain at least 5.0% of its annual unconsolidated net income until such reserve reaches at least 20.0% of the value of the company’s share capital (equal to €22.5 million as of September 30, 2020), and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer.

Such reorganizations may change the security over the Notes. Each of these possible mergers is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to complete any of the Mergers in any particular time frame or at all. In case the Issuer pursues the Delisting Merger, it will be undertaken pursuant to the provisions of Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code. In order to complete the Delisting Merger, if any, there are various steps that the Issuer must take including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the Delisting Merger, approval by the Company’s committee with responsibility for considering and approving certain related party transactions, and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the methods used for determining the exchange ratio and the fairness of the ratio as well as stating the reasonableness of the assumptions of the merger plan. As the incorporating company or the company resulting from the Delisting Merger, if any, will be an Italian joint stock company (società per azioni), the independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Delisting Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the 61 ----- independent expert will release its report in a timely manner and/or that the report will approve the reasonableness of the assumptions of the merger plan or that the other steps required for the Delisting Merger will be taken in a timely manner, or at all.

Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the Delisting Merger, if any, are entitled to challenge the Delisting Merger. Additionally, we do not intend to undertake the Company Merger or the Debt Push Company Merger, and are not required to do so, unless we acquire 100% of the Outstanding Company Shares. As a result, among other things, the Notes would remain structurally subordinated to any indebtedness incurred at the Company, and the Issuer will have access only to its proportionate share of any dividends or distributions from the Company for purposes of making payments under the Notes. Any such dividends and distributions received by the Issuer may be further reduced by applicable taxes. Furthermore, in such case, there would continue to be minority shareholders in the Company. The presence of minority interests in the Company could impose significant limitations and restrictions on the influence that the Issuer and IMA Bidco may exercise as the indirect and direct shareholders of the Company. See “—Risks Related to the Transactions—The results of the MTO is subject to significant _uncertainties and risks.

Therefore the Issuer would have, on the one hand, a greater portion of any dividends or distributions from the Company, but a greater debt burden. Conversely, larger minority interests in the Company would mean a lesser portion of any dividends or distributions from the Company but also a lower amount of Notes outstanding that the Issuer would have to service and ultimately repay. The Issuer intends to lend a portion of the proceeds of the Notes to the Company to repay the existing financial indebtedness of the Company (excluding finance leases) and will therefore have a loan claim into the Company in the amount of such loan, and the holders of the Notes will be given security interests over such claim.

It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Company Merger or Delisting Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by Company MergerCo as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax _Considerations”) would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange and_ would have a new holding period and new tax basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of one or more series of the Notes at the time of the Company Merger or Delisting Merger, if any, is less than the principal amount of such series of Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such series of Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are incorporated as societa` per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded that a court may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code in respect of any of the funds made available by the Issuer to any of its subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any obligations of any Italian subsidiary vis-à-vis the Issuer under any intercompany lean be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan granted to the relevant Italian subsidiary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. 64 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including the laws of Italy). In addition, any proceeds of the Notes which are used to fund certain net working capital and cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and to repay 65 ----- Target Existing Debt (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) are required to be contributed in the form of loans (the “Proceeds Loans”) from the Issuer to the Company (or to IMA Bidco and to the Company), whose receivables, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be assigned to the Security Agent and form part of the Notes Collateral, providing holders of the Notes with payment claims against IMA Bidco and the Company, as applicable, upon enforcement. Any repayment, reduction, cancellation or equitization of such Proceeds Loans (which actions are not prohibited by the Indenture) would in turn reduce the value of the potential payment claims available to holders of the Notes against IMA Bidco and the Company upon enforcement. If the proceeds of any sale or enforcement of the Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors in the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale or enforcement of the Notes Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Notes Collateral or any intercreditor arrangement governing the Issuer’s creditor’s rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Notes Collateral. See “—The proceeds from the _enforcement of the Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”. In_ addition, the Notes Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to the Issuer. The Notes Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease.

The enforcement of the Notes Collateral will be limited to the extent of the amount which can be secured by a particular security grantor without rendering the security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to, applicable law and to avoid certain significant costs associated with taking certain security interests. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees or the Notes Collateral against any Guarantor and any grantor of Notes Collateral will also be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors and grantors of security interests generally. These laws and defenses include, primarily with respect to Guarantors, those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under applicable fraudulent conveyance and similar laws, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security interest provided by such guarantor or security grantor if it found that: - the guarantee was issued or the security interest was granted with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or shareholders of the respective guarantor or security grantor; - the relevant guarantor or security grantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee or the security interest granted, and: O the relevant guarantor or security grantor was insolvent, became insolvent within a certain time frame or was rendered insolvent because of the guarantee or security interest granted; O the relevant guarantor or security grantor was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the guarantee or security interest granted; O the relevant guarantor or security grantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debt beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or O the guarantee or security interest granted was not in the best interests or for the benefit of the relevant guarantor or security grantor. The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a guarantor or security grantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they became due. In such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee or Notes Collateral, or held it unenforceable, the holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Notes Collateral, would be creditors solely of the Issuer and any remaining Guarantors and would benefit only from any remaining Notes Collateral. The holders of the Notes may also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such Guarantee or such Notes Collateral. Further, the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral may be subject to claims that they should be limited or subordinated under United States, Italian or other applicable law.

The liens in the Notes Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Security Agent or the Trustee, acting through the Security Agent, is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the Issue Date. The Issuer and the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the Security Agent or the Trustee, acting through the Security Agent, in perfecting the holders of the Notes’ security interest in specified Notes Collateral. The Trustee of the Notes and the Security Agent will not monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform such Trustee or the Security Agent of the future acquisition of property and rights that should constitute Notes Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly create and perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property and rights. Such failure may result in such security interest being created in such property or rights or in the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties being adversely affected. Furthermore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on certain of the Notes Collateral may be limited by mandatory provisions of Italian law and may be subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the security documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. Under Italian law, the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of the Trustee, since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as agent for holders of the Notes under security interests granted over Italian assets is debatable under Italian law. In particular, even though trusts governed by foreign jurisdictions are recognized under Italian law, there are still doubts as to the validity of a trust when it does not comply with Italian law provisions governing rights in rem (diritti reali), security interests or when the trust is deemed to pursue a scope that does not deserve protection in light of the general principles of Italian law; to the Issuer’s knowledge, similar trust arrangements have never been tested in Italian courts and therefore there might be risks regarding the enforceability of the Notes Collateral insofar as it relates to such trust arrangements in the event that they are not upheld. 69 ----- Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes may not be direct parties to the Security Documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes who are not identified in the relevant security documents are not secured by the security interests created under the Security Documents and/or may not be able to validly enforce such security interests. To address the above potential issue, the Notes Collateral will be created in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as agent with representative powers (mandatario con rappresentanza) of the secured creditors and as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414_bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law Decree No. 133/2014, as converted by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be created in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Notes. However, there is no case law on how such Italian Civil Code provision may be applied to security interests created in accordance therewith in connection with a bond issuance by an Italian entity and furthermore there is not even any guidance or available interpretation on how such a new provision may be applied to security interests created to secure bond issuances made by a non-Italian entity. In addition, notwithstanding the position under Italian law that the transfer of an underlying debt obligation implies the automatic transfer of the relevant security interest, the abovementioned risk of unenforceability of the Notes Collateral located in Italy applies, inter alia, to any person acquiring a Note in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging its status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of the enforcement. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors. Furthermore, in the absence of precedent case law, it is also untested and debated whether after a merger pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian civil code any security interests granted on the target’s assets could be considered as falling within the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”. Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, among other things, the “majority senior_ secured creditors” (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Notes and any pari passu secured indebtedness) will constitute an instructing group and will have the right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the 70 ----- Collateral, provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, if neither the majority senior secured creditors nor the Majority Super Senior Creditors provide instructions or have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce, in limited circumstances, Majority Second Lien Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or Majority Topco Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) may have certain enforcement rights. The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging obligations (if any) or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Notes Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders of Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Notes Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale.

The security interests on the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Issuer, or the Security Agent, fails or is unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these security interests. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these security interests. In addition, certain applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest be perfected. For example, under Italian law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and thus retain its priority if certain actions are undertaken by the secured party and/ or the grantor of the security interest. The security interests in the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Issuer or the Security Agent fails or are unable to take the actions required to perfect the security interest. Such failure may result in the invalidity and/ or ineffectiveness of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Notes Collateral. The Trustee and Security Agent will not monitor, and the Issuer may not comply with its obligations to inform the Trustee or the Security Agent of any future acquisition of property and rights by the Issuer, and therefore the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain 73 ----- circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due. The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an event of default under the Notes. If a change of control event were to occur, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Issuer or any successor entity would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Guarantee Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Issuer’s other then-existing contractual obligations would allow the Issuer to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility, the Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer’s subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuer expects that it would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Issuer would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, respectively, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.” The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution to bind all holders of the Notes, including noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely your 74 ----- rights as a holder of the Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely.

In addition to the design and assembly of machinery, we also provide After-Sales products and services throughout the lifecycle of the machinery that we sell. We attribute our success, in part, to our unique asset-light business model, which relies on our strong core labor-intensive capabilities in research, design, development, engineering and testing, while outsourcing lower valueadded aspects of the assembly process to a group of select local suppliers. We have made significant investments in research and development to enable us to remain at the forefront of machine customization and product innovation. At the same time, we have fostered a diverse network of local suppliers, many of whom we own minority stakes in, and have tightly integrated these suppliers with our operations, thereby enabling us to maintain low capital expenditure levels and a highly variable cost base. Founded in 1961 and headquartered in Bologna, Italy, an area known for the presence of wellestablished manufacturing companies and a talented engineering labor force, we have 45 manufacturing facilities and approximately 6,000 employees, out of whom approximately 70.0% are engineers and highly specialized technicians, in nine countries, including Italy, the United States, China, Argentina, Germany and Switzerland. We sell our products worldwide to a loyal blue-chip customer base, both directly through our on-the-ground salesforce and, in selected markets, third party agents. We have historically been able to build long-lasting customer relationships by creating highly customized and specialized products with shorter lead times due to our flexible supply chain. Our loyal blue-chip customer base allows us to achieve stable and highly visible revenue, and we generated the majority of our revenue in the last five fiscal years from our existing customers, mainly through new machine orders and After-Sales products and services. 88 ----- For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated revenue of €1.6 billion, EBITDA of €291.8 million (representing an EBITDA Margin of 18.2%) and net profit of €119.3 million, and in 2019, we generated revenue of €1.6 billion, EBITDA of €273.4 million (representing an EBITDA Margin of 17.1%) and net profit of €169.6 million. We also have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects, with a Backlog as of September 30, 2020 of €919.4 million. Within the global packaging machinery industry, we primarily serve the consumer (including food and beverage), pharmaceutical and tobacco packaging machinery reference markets. We generally operate in niches within these reference markets that we believe are highly resilient and fast growing, and we maintain a leadership position in many of them. Our three business segments (i) Tea, Food, & Other, (ii) Pharmaceutical, and (iii) Tobacco, are geared towards competing in these niches.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Meanwhile, revenue from contracts with customers from our Tobacco packaging segment went from €151.7 million in 2017 to €91.3 million in 2019, equal to a compound annual negative growth rate of (22.4%), over the three year period primarily due to elevated capital expenditures by key customers in 2017 and 2018, followed by a drop in capital expenditures in 2019. _Revenue from contracts with customers by_ segment_ **For the years ended December 31,",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Our After-Sales business is closely connected to our Original Equipment business, given that an increase in our installed base directly drives an increase in the demand for our After-Sales products and services. Our After-Sales business is characterized by higher margins, on average, with After-Sales representing, on average, approximately 30.0% of our revenue and, on average, approximately 43.0% of our gross profit. Accordingly, our After-Sales business represents an attractive growth opportunity and the high margins of our After-Sales business make it an increasingly important driver of our overall business. The strength of our After-Sales business was particularly significant in the first half of 2020 when travel was restricted by governments around the world. During that time, sales of Original Equipment, which often entail in-person meetings and inspections were difficult to make, but we were able to consistently deliver After-Sales services remotely to our customers.

This may include an adverse effect from reduced global economic activity and resulting demand for consumer products and, therefore, the machines we manufacture for the makers of consumer products. It may also include restrictions and limitations on the ability to conduct business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain, workforce, and operations, which could be as significant as the ordered closure of one or more of our facilities or the managerial decision to guard the wellbeing of our workforce at the cost of maximized profits. Our revenue from contracts with customers for the first three quarters of 2020 remained solid, demonstrating that our business is, in fact, resilient and capable of delivering strong results under challenging conditions. This does not mean our business has not been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we do not report revenue on a month by month basis, an analysis of our revenue during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrates the resiliency of our business. Revenue from contracts with customers was materially negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions imposed in March 2020, resulting in a comparative fall from €175.0 to €128.2 million. Revenues from customers rebounded in April, resulting in a comparative increase from €81.0 million to €91.8 million. Revenues from contracts with customers in May amounted to €105.4 million, largely in line with the same period of 2019 when they amounted to €108.3 million. In addition, our order intake did not suffer project cancellations between March and May 2020 and combined orders during that period were higher than combined orders between March and May in 2019. Our order intake in March 2020 was equal to €147.0 million showing a decrease of 5.1% compared to the same period in 2019, driven mainly by an intake reduction in our Tobacco segment (75.1%) unrelated to the Covid-19 pandemic, while our Tea, Food and Other segment experienced an increase of 7.0% and our Pharmaceutical segment experienced a decrease of 4.3%. Then, our order intake in April 2020 was equal to €92.0 million showing an increase of 46.7% compared to the same period in 2019, driven primarily by strong performance in our Tea, Food & Other segment (which increased by 59.0%) and Pharmaceutical segment (which increased by 45.5%), while our Tobacco segment decreased by 67.7%. Finally, our order intake in May 2020 was equal to €153.0 million showing an increase of 18.6% compared to the same period in 2019, driven primarily by strong performance across all our business segments, with our Tobacco segment increasing by 100.0%, our Tea, Food & Other segment increasing by 37.5% and our Pharmaceutical segment increasing by 10.5%. Our performance in a period marked by difficulty and uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrates our resiliency. While our revenue and order intake from contracts with customers for the first three quarters are promising, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of reduced economic activity and disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on financial and operational results, will be primarily determined by the length of time that such reductions and disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact of measures that might be imposed in response to the pandemic and whether a vaccine or drug can be developed and deployed that allows business operations to return to their pre-pandemic form. We anticipate that, primarily due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 will be approximately 10.0% lower than EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our business is diversified across many geographies and has become more diversified in recent years. Italy, our original market and the country in which our headquarters are located, is our largest market, but, in terms of revenue generation, it represented 12.1% of total revenue from contracts with customers in 2019. While we have experienced growth in all geographies over the past three years, our revenues from contracts with customers as a percentage of our total business has grown principally in North America. The percentage of our revenue coming from the European Union (excluding Italy) has changed from 30.4% in 2017 to 28.3% in 2019. Similarly, the percentage of our revenue from contracts with customers coming from Other European countries has declined from 8.2% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2019. The percentage of our revenue coming from Italy has fallen from 12.3% in 2017 to 12.1% in 2019. Meanwhile, we have increased the percentage of our business in North America, with its share of our revenue from contracts with customers increasing from 17.1% in 2017 to 19.7% in 2019. We have also increased the percentage of our business in other countries (which includes Brazil, Mexico, Algeria, and Morocco) with its share of our revenue from contracts with customers increasing from 10.1% in 2017 to 10.9% in 2019. We have maintained the percentage of our business in the Asia & Middle East region, with its share of our revenue from contracts with customers relatively stable at 22.0% from 2017 to 2019. While increasing the diversity of our revenue from contracts with customers, overall, over the past three years, our revenue from contracts with customers have increased each year and over total revenue from contracts with customers from each geographic region have increased.

Revenue is recognized for an amount that reflects the consideration to which we believe we are entitled to fulfil our obligation, with the transfer of the goods or service when the customer acquires control. Our main revenue streams are: (i) machines and contracts in progress, (ii) change parts (sub-units of machines that are sold together with them or at a later date), (iii) spare parts and other materials, and (iv) technical assistance. Contract work and part of the technical assistance, commissioning services in particular, are obligations to be fulfilled over time. The method of measuring progress in fulfilling contract work in progress, on projects carried out according to specific customer needs, is the cost-to-cost input method that accounts for revenue based on the effort or input (i.e., costs) that we make in fulfilling the performance obligation guaranteed to the client on the total inputs that we expect to have to use to complete it (contract budget). This process considers the best estimate of the project costs at the balance sheet date. The directors base their estimates on the information deriving from the internal contract reporting, forecasting and accounting system; they also examine and, where necessary, review the estimates of revenue and costs at the various stages of completion of an order. Any economic effects are recognized in the period that the updates are made. To provide better support for management’s estimates, we have set up contract risk analysis tools, designed to identify, monitor and quantify the risks relating to the performance of such contract work. The machines, kits, spare parts and other materials and the After-Sales technical assistance represent obligations to fulfil at a point in time. Revenue relating to the sale of products is recognized when substantially all of the risks and rewards of control over the goods have been transferred to the purchaser. The moment of transfer of control coincides with the transfer of ownership or possession of the goods to the buyer and therefore generally coincides with the shipment of the goods or completion of the service. We receive up to 30.0% on the total invoice when the order is placed, 10.0% when drawings or other contractual milestones are completed, 30.0% typically received when the order is built and customer is authorized at IMA’s facility, and the remaining 30.0% when the machines are installed at the customer’s site.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Taxes are generally recognized in profit or loss except when they regard items recognized directly in equity. In this case, the related income taxes are also recognized in equity. Current taxes are taxes which are expected to pay based on the taxable income for the year and are calculated using the tax rate applying in the various countries in which the IMA Group operates. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated by applying the liability method to temporary differences between the value of consolidated balance sheet assets and liabilities and the corresponding values recognized for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are determined using the tax rate which is expected to apply when the assets are realized, or the liabilities settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that taxable income in future years will be sufficient to realize them. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off-set only when there is a legal entitlement to do so and when they relate to taxes due to the same tax authority. Provision for taxes that might arise on transferring undistributed earnings of subsidiaries are only made if there is a real intention to transfer such earnings.

The cash flow provided by operating activities during the first three quarters of 2020 increased primarily due to an increase in profits earned from our operations driven by the short-term factors that attributed to our increase in revenue over the same period. For an explanation of such factors, see “Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to Nine Months _Ended September 30, 2019—Revenue from contracts with customers.”_ Cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to €161.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €41.0 million, or 34.0%, compared to €120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The cash flow provided by operating activities in 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in profits earned from our operations and an increase in the cash flows generated from working capital. Cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to €120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of €5.4 million, or 4.7%, compared to €115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The cash flow provided by operating activities in 2018 increased primarily due to an increase in profits earned from our operations, which was partially offset by an increase in the cash flows used in working capital. Our cash flow provided by operating activities tend to be uneven across seasons, which is caused by the budgeting and spending practices of our customers, which are typical of institutions. Generally, our cash flow provided by/(used in) operating activities are higher in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as our customers budget for and purchase our products and services with a view toward their needs in the next calendar year. _Cash flow used in investing activities_ Cash flow used in investing activities amounted to €33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of €253.6 million, or 88.3%, compared to €287.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in cash flow used in our investment activities was mainly due to the acquisition of ATOP in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 109 ----- Cash flow used in investing activities amounted to €305.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €168.5 million, or 122.9%, compared to €137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash flow used in our investment activities was mainly due to the acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flow used in investing activities amounted to €137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of €45.6 million, compared to €91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow used in our investment activities was mainly due to the acquisition of several businesses and companies and the purchase of investments.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on elements that are known when the financial statements are prepared, on historical experience and on any other factors that are considered to be relevant. _Estimates_ The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and continuously by us. If the items subject to estimates do not perform as assumed, then the actual results could differ from the estimates, which would require adjustments accordingly. The effects of any changes in estimate are recognized in the income statement in the period in which the adjustment is made, or prospectively in future periods. The items requiring estimates for which there is a risk that a material difference may arise in respect of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the future are discussed below. 114 ----- An additional critical point for estimates and for their reviews in the interim financials of 2020 is the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, which is still hard to predict. _Revenue from contracts with customers and estimates of contractual risks_ Revenue from contracts with customers for contract work and contract assets and liabilities, are based on the cost-to-cost method which requires a prior estimate of the entire lifetime costs of individual projects, updating them at each balance sheet date. This requires assumptions to be made by us. These assumptions can be affected by multiple factors, such as the time span of several years over which some projects are developed, their high level of technology and innovative content, the possible presence of price variations and revisions, and machinery performance guarantees, including an estimate of contractual risks, where applicable. These facts and circumstances make it difficult to estimate the projects’ costs to complete and, consequently, to estimate the value of contract work in progress at the balance sheet date. _Goodwill and other intangible assets_ Goodwill and other intangible assets, deriving from the allocation of the price of business combinations and the impairment test of such assets, require processes and methods for evaluating and determining estimates based on complex assumptions regarding revenue, operating costs, margins, investments, terminal value growth rates and discount rates, taking into consideration the conditions of the different markets in which the Group operates. These facts and circumstances make it difficult the application of these processes and methods and, consequently, to estimate the value of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance sheet date. We generally carry out the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets when preparing the annual financial statements, when all of the information needed is available, except in cases where there are clear signs of impairment that require an immediate assessment of any loss in value. Since the Covid-19 pandemic constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of impairment (i.e. an impairment indicator), the sustainability of the impairment tests is being assessed also at interim date. 115 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Notwithstanding the negative impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the global economy, it is anticipated that its effect will reinforce some of the positive emerging trends in the global packaging machinery market (e.g., an increase in pharmaceutical products consumption, product safety and factory automation), while at the same time reducing new product launches of certain fast moving consumer goods categories. It is also expected that health and well-being, product safety concerns and factory automation, as long term drivers of the underlying consumer and pharmaceutical end-markets, will become increasingly relevant following the Covid-19 Pandemic, while the trends relating to demographics and an aging society, sustainable/ethical consumerism, as long-term secular growth trends, will be unaffected by the Covid-19 Pandemic. However, due to the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 Pandemic across the economic landscape, the relevance of two prominent long term drivers of the global packaging machinery market, namely the convenience and “on the go” lifestyle, as well as the consumer good trends towards increased consumption, may not be accurately evaluated. Regardless of the Covid-19 Pandemic, we believe that the following are noticeable market trends driving demand for new machinery or retro-fitting of old machinery: (i) demand for diverse packaging formats related to product variations (i.e., customizable products, standard versus premium options, etc.); (ii) sustainability driving changes in packaging materials and formats; (iii) packaging changes related to easy open, child resistant and similar products, (iv) increased labelling and traceability regulation; (v) more independent brands; and (vi) differentiated / premium packaging needed to stand out and “refresh” established brands. 117 |Historical C A G R 1 4 -1 9 : + 5 .4 % 7.8 8.1 7.0 7.3 6.2 6.5|Forecast C A G R 2 0 -2 4 : + 5 .7 % 10.6 10.0 9.5 9.0 8.5| |---|---| -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Higher packaging variety drives the demand for more flexible packaging machinery, while accelerating demand for packaging food drives production volumes globally, especially in emerging markets. 2. _Machinery complexity. Flexible packaging requirements drive machine complexity and expertise and increasing hygienic requirements drive demand for compliant packaging machinery. In addition, environment-friendly materials alter the requirements on packaging machinery, whereas automation increases complexity of machinery through software, sensors etc. 3. _Machinery price. The price pressure in the packaging equipment industry is partially mitigated by technologically more advanced machinery as well as environmental and hygienic requirements. However, prices remain under pressure due to quickly improving product offerings from mid-end providers and an increasing number of competitors from low-cost countries (e.g., China) entering the market. 4. _Machine productivity. A decrease of machine productivity is expected as packaging variety increases setup costs. Automation once again plays a key role, as it can improve overall equipment efficiency through reduced downtime (e.g., with remote service), higher throughput and reduced manual labor. 5. _Scrap rate: While more flexible packaging machinery is needed to set up production lines more efficiently, higher importance of suitable packaging solutions drives demand for new machinery. _Trends_ The tea, food & other original equipment market trends are strictly correlated to its drivers. For instance, higher packaging variety and the increasing importance of packaged food positively affects market drivers for packaging machinery equipment. In particular, higher packaging variety results into product differentiation via packaging style or material, which in turn increases demand for premium packaging and premium appearance (not only for premium products). Additionally, there is a growing demand for meal replacements while snacking drives the consumption of bite-sized/portion packs. Finally, the accelerating e-commerce industry is increasing demand for individualized sized packaging in small quantities / sizes. 120 ----- Demand for packaged food, whether driven by convenience or food safety (e.g., hygiene and allergy safety), in turn, drives production volumes globally, especially in emerging markets, while also increasing the importance of product transparency on packaging (as evidenced by the “farm-to-fork” trend). Moreover, increasing hygiene requirements and longer shelf life fuel additional packaging demand. Sustainability and digitalization also positively affect the demand for packaging machinery for food, dairy and household products alike. Specifically, there is an increasing demand for sustainable packaging and reduction of packaging waste, especially plastics and aluminum. Notably, sustainable packaging material most often requires new technologies in key process steps, such as the gluing and sealing process and also requires adjustments to packaging equipment to work with different materials (e.g. recyclable, compostable, etc.), driving the demand for new machinery. Increased automation and digitalization is also affecting the consumer market and its drivers, as an expected rapid adoption of sensors and software within packaging machinery equipment increases the ability to provide automation solutions in consumer products, thus enabling improvement of overall equipment effectiveness and productivity. _Key customers_ There are three major segments of customers which are distinguished based on their business model. Global generalists These are usually large multi-national companies manufacturing blockbuster products as their core business and often have a tendency towards a more centralized strategy for standardized components and having key accounts with constantly high order volume and framework contracts. Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) increasing openness to reduce in-house engineering competencies resulting in reliance on their providers; (ii) operations are in mature markets resulting in standardization and optimization of process flow and the total cost of ownership; and (iii) increased presence in emerging markets giving rise to the opening of new facilities with a tendency towards turnkey-solutions. Regional specialists Usually companies with a regional footprint and which typically have customized systems tailored to their process flow and that utilize internal engineering capacity for machine integration and setup. Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) increasing willingness to pay a price premium for customized, highly reliable machinery; (ii) higher need for individual bespoke line solutions; and (iii) an increasing need for automation in large scale productions. Local specialist Usually local companies with focused application domain and regional coverage. Typically manual labor holds a higher share of their process flow and they have a focus on cost efficient production and high overall equipment effectiveness. Two trends characterize this customer segment: (i) dependence on a specific application domain which often requires no-frills machinery; and (ii) a tendency to source services and spare parts from third parties to reduce downtime and costs. _Barriers to entry_ The tea, food & other packaging machinery market is characterized by three main barriers to entry, with personal relationships and trust having the most relevance. In particular, personal contact and trust between suppliers and end-market customers allows for a long-term relationship often resulting in discounts for services and spare parts on the one hand and continued use of the supplier on the other. 121 ----- Furthermore, the equipment lifecycle is a moderately relevant barrier to entry. High initial investments and continuous maintenance and modernization result in prolonged depreciation periods over 15 years. Therefore, switching suppliers rarely occurs during the running lifecycle of a machine, however receiving new requests for proposals near the end of the lifecycle of the equipment is standard procedure. Lastly, service coverage is a further moderate barrier to entry. In general terms, geographic coverage for support and service is important for global customers who also value efficiency through repetitive installation of equipment and similarly trained staff. _Competitive landscape_ The packaging equipment in the tea, food & other original equipment market is composed by major competitors comprising a few large equipment groups. Our main competitors offer a varied product and service offering, and range between a high and medium price point. It is important to note that the market is broadly fragmented, and competitors often only compete in certain sub-markets. The key competitors, including their primary markets are, listed by revenue, Tetra Laval (focused on dairy, non-alcoholic beverages and personal care), Krones (focused on alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and cosmetics), Syntegon (has a comprehensive offering), Ishida (focused on snacks), and Fuji Packaging (focused on snacks, beef, fruits and vegetables). Despite being a highly fragmented market, there are only a few large scale players who offer a broad product portfolio at high price points given the majority of players are more specialized. Only a selection of intermediate players offers product portfolios comprising two or three product classes for medium and high price points, whereas certain specialized players have a main focus on one product class at price levels ranging from medium to high.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Personalized medicine (involving smaller batches) is expected to drive a demand for more flexible packaging machinery, in addition as more generic companies push into the market driving significantly increased total production volumes. Furthermore, the rising demand for packaged pharmaceutical products with higher sanitization standards in emerging markets can be observed and is expected to further drive production volumes and the need for expanded production capacity. 2. _Machine complexity. The introduction of more strict regulations is closely correlated to the increase in the quality and traceability requirements on equipment and packaging. In addition, the rise of highly potent or controlled drug types drive more complex processes and packaging equipment while simultaneously the increase in automation increases the complexity of the machinery themselves through additional software and sensors. Finally, environment-friendly materials alter the requirements on packaging machinery and such changes can require modifications to previously installed machinery. 3. _Machine productivity. Smaller batch sizes imply lower throughput which implies a higher demand for machinery. However, automation can improve overall equipment efficiency through reduced downtime (e.g., with remote service), higher throughput and reduced manual labor. Furthermore, high productivity by companies offering generics may adversely affect machine demand, this increases industry productivity but may have a negative impact on new machinery demand. 4. _Machine price. The main costs associated to this driver are: (i) engineering costs for adequate packaging machinery due to an increase in regulations and more complex drug types; (ii) price pressures on equipment providers due to the growth of generics companies and contract manufacturing organizations; and (iii) the expected overall increase in machine prices due to the rising share of sensors and software within machinery. 5. _Scrap rate: Regulatory requirements such as traceability require the purchase of new packaging machinery while new drug types call for new packaging machinery as processes become more complex. _Trends_ Growth in the pharmaceutical packaging machinery market is expected to accelerate mainly due to higher underlying volume growth from generics, since the volume share of generics is expected to increase due to continued patent expirations and this is expected to have a negative impact on machinery market growth. Furthermore, regulations and data integrity will play a pivotal role as an underlying production volume trend in the foreseeable future, as traceability and serialization requirements will continue to increase in upcoming years, however, the impact on machinery has already been largely incorporated. On the same terms, highly potent/complex drugs will underpin the impact of biologics on the packaging machinery market which is expected to be similar to the past five years. Personalized medicine constitutes another notable trend in underlying production volume, because orphan drugs volume share growth is expected to decelerate over the coming years, with small batch medication growth acceleration. The last two main trends in underlying production volume are product consolidation which is expected to accelerate over the coming years as a result of the consolidation of contract manufacturing organizations, this is expected to have a negative impact on machinery market growth and, finally, automation and digitalization of lines is expected to accelerate compared to the past five years. _Key customers_ There are three major segments of customers which are distinguished based on their business model. Large pharmaceutical companies These are entities which usually are comprised of a combination of originator and (branded) generic business with a global presence with high budgets for development of drugs and ultimately therefore require some small scale production for the preclinical phase. Notably, the top 20 pharmaceutical companies account for approximately 80% of the pharmaceutical product revenue. 123 ----- Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) decreasing large scale production due to lack of new blockbuster products, which increases the trend towards outsourcing to contract manufacturing organizations; (ii) increasing demand for small batch production due to personalized medicine; and (iii) need for standardization and modularization to allow transfer of entire product lines. Generic specialists Usually a generic subsidiary of a large pharmaceutical company having requirements for major investments for large scale production especially for liquid production lines but low research and development budgets and lack of product differentiation due to identical formulation. Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) expiring patents will push the demand for large batch sizes; (ii) shift of production to low-cost countries (e.g., India, China) to achieve cost efficiencies; and (iii) build-up of in house capabilities to further drive down service cost. Contract manufacturing organizations A contract manufacturing organization usually works as a contract manufacturer with the primary business model of “selling over-capacities”, whose services can include formulation, development, pre-clinical and clinical trials, scale-up and commercial production. Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) increasing consolidation and M&A activity with a trend for horizontal growth; (ii) tendency towards centralized equipment and service procurement; and (iii) increasing focus on process efficiency and automation. _Barriers to entry_ The pharmaceutical packaging machinery market is characterized by three main barriers to entry, with the reputation and quality of the supplier having the most relevance. In particular, this market is heavily regulated, a circumstance that consequently leads to high quality, strong technological requirements and a focus on the reliability of services, all features heavily appreciated by the customers who therefore tend to be locked-in to a supplier. Furthermore, a high level of process integration requires dedicated production lines to avoid crosscontamination. It is common in the pharmaceutical packaging machinery market to have a high level of integration into existing production processes (especially for liquid pharmaceuticals) and a change of supplier is only feasible near the end of the lifecycle of the entire production line. The least relevant barrier to entry is the established service relationships. In general terms, only a broad service network is able to respond quickly and appropriately to machine failures and it relies upon efficiency through repeatability of equipment installation and staff training. _Competitive landscape_ The pharmaceutical packaging machinery market is fragmented and only a select group of companies offer broad product portfolios across liquid and solid pack pharmaceuticals, among others. Despite being a highly fragmented market, there are only a few market players with a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products at different price points, these are Syntegon and Romaco. Only a selection of intermediate players offers selected product classes at different price levels, ranging from high to low, such as GEO, Korber Medipak, Marchesini Group, Optima, ACG. Whereas certain specialized players are experts in one particular product segment, serving mostly the high and medium price point segments, such as Uhlmann Group, HH, Glatt, Fette Compacting, Bausch and Strobel, Bohle, and Groninger.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Furthermore, the tobacco market is characterized by increasing product innovation in both traditional cigarettes and other products, including e-cigarettes and “heat not burned” products. The reduction in consumers, or limiting of new consumers, in the tobacco market has direct negative impacts on the tobacco packaging machinery market, however, this is somewhat offset by the introduction of new products which require additional or retrofitted packaging machinery. _Trends_ While consumers are increasingly shifting towards next generation products, stricter regulations create headwinds for the manufacturers. In particular, there is a growing demand for e-cigarettes as an alternative combustible tobacco products whose devices and consumables with novel packaging requirements are driving a demand for new packaging equipment. Nevertheless, the demand for “heat not burned” products is also growing rapidly fueled by the marketing shift by many of the traditional tobacco players. In general terms, “heat not burned” products still have similar packaging requirements to cigarettes, with a certain retrofitting required. In addition, the regulatory uncertainty and future interest in tobacco products makes them less certain than other markets, which results in less certainty as to their potential demand for packaging equipment. _Key customers_ There are two major segments of customers which are distinguished based on their business model. Global tobacco players Global tobacco players, previously dominating the combustible market with global production and distribution footprint, are now shifting towards next generation tobacco products as their main growth driver (e.g., by manufacturing next generation product devices as well as consumables). 125 ----- Three trends characterize this customer segment: (i) a global production footprint and planning of operations based on local demand requirements; (ii) retrofitting of existing machinery capacities (used for combustibles) to address demand for “heat not burned” products; and (iii) large investments in new generation products capacities and acquisition of brands. Start-ups / specialized players Specialized players developing novel new generation products devices, consumables or liquids with a focus on product innovation to differentiate from global tobacco players while retaining a broad range of e-liquid brands for open device systems. Two trends characterize this customer segment: (i) fragmentation and volatility due to a lack of dominant device design with low entry barriers for e-liquid producers; and (ii) a trial-and-error phase of many players requiring high levels of equipment flexibility. _Barriers to entry_ The tobacco segment is characterized by two main barriers to entry which are technical know-how and retrofitting. Switching barriers appear to be high, strongly influenced by high requirements on supplier quality and high levels of process integration. In particular, technical know-how allows suppliers to tailor equipment to the exact technical specification of large tobacco customers. Furthermore, large tobacco players tend to follow a replacement/retrofitting strategy for their “hot not burned” products, which consequently generates stickiness to existing suppliers for their existing production line. _Competitive landscape_ Four main players dominate the supply of the tobacco packaging machinery end-market: (i) G.D S.p.A.; (ii) the Company; (iii) Focke & Co. (GmbH & Co. KG), and (iv) Hauni Maschinenbau GmbH, by providing the majority of packaging machinery for combustible and “heat not burned” tobacco products. Furthermore, multiple additional competitors cover selected process steps such as overwrapping or stamping, which include Bobst Group SA, Pattyn Packing Lines NV, Marden Edwards Ltd, and Sollas Holland B.V.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770
143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.15,Automation,521.15.1,,"Although automation is applied in a wide variety of industries using various materials, it is particularly helpful in production lines for specialized plastic products. Among the production lines to which automation is applied are lines for customized bottle caps, syringes, contact lenses and inhalers. Increasing product complexity and variety, as well as regulatory requirements drive the demand for more complex machinery, and further automation across each of our end-markets, as a result we expect this aspect of the broader packaging machinery industry to grow rapidly as customers begin demanding more integrated solutions, forcing players in the industry to start investing in solutions for automating their machinery. In particular, new product development is heading towards a higher and more complex standard for components, which are increasingly miniaturized and requiring high-precision injection-molding equipment whose demand is, and will continue to be, rising. For instance, the global volume of inhalers is expected to continue broadly in line with the historical trend, growing at approximately a CAGR of 5.4% per annum from 2019 to 2024, due to two main factors driving the end-market demand: (i) increasing number of diagnosed chronic respiratory patients; and (ii) the growing inhaler penetration in developing markets. In addition, contact lens manufacturers are aiming to increasingly customize lenses to meet specific customer needs, as a result, the number of stock keeping units is experiencing a fast growth and will continue to drive demand for flexible machinery with fast changeovers. Contact lens volumes are expected to grow at approximately a CAGR of 4.9% driven by a continued shift to daily disposable 126 ----- lenses. In particular, the demand for vision correcting has been growing across the world due to an aging population and worsening vision due to increasing screen time while conditions like astigmatism and presbyopia will continue to be fundamental driver in this market, as a result, daily disposable lenses have been gaining popularity, due to a higher level of comfort and convenience, boosting overall contact lens volumes. Finally, the safety of devices, particularly injectables, relies on components being of the correct dimension. Moreover, the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration’s approval for devices typically requires small tolerances, so equipment must be precise, accurate and reliable. The volume of pens and auto-injectors is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6.9%, driven by the prevalence of diseases such as diabetes, RA, multiple sclerosis and other chronic diseases, as well as penetration of pen devices in various markets. In particular, insulin pens account for approximately 80% of the total volume and are used for insulin delivery to treat diabetes, whose prevalence is constantly on the rise driven by growth of obesity, whereas penetration of pens and auto-injectors will continue to increase in the following years driven by ease-of-use and flexibility. 127 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

These trends have led to the niches in which we operate in our two largest reference markets, the consumer (including food and beverage) and pharmaceuticals packaging machinery markets, to grow, 129 ----- in terms of revenue, at a compound annual growth rate of 4.0% and 5.4% respectively, from 2014 to 2019. During the same period, our revenue from our corresponding Tea, Coffee, & Other and Pharmaceutical business segments has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.0% and 7.7%, respectively. The niches in which we operate within the consumer and pharmaceuticals packaging machinery markets are projected to continue to grow, in terms of revenue, at a compound annual growth rate of 3.9% and 5.7%, respectively, between 2020 and 2024, in line with recent trends. In addition, revenue from the next-generation products niche in the tobacco packaging machinery market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% from 2019 to 2024. The resiliency of our reference markets has been demonstrated by the historical evolution of capital expenditures between 2001 and 2018 in the respective end markets despite past economic downturns. Capital expenditures in the pharmaceutical end market have steadily increased since 2001, rising from less than €100 billion globally in 2001 to over €200 billion in 2019. During the financial crisis of 2008, capital expenditures in the pharmaceutical end market declined by approximately 7.0%, and then, in 2009, quickly bounced back with growth of 17.0% globally. Capital expenditures in the consumer end market have been even more resilient, steadily increasing since 2001 from about €150 billion globally in 2001 to more than €500 billion in 2019. During the aforementioned financial crisis, capital expenditures in the consumer end market declined by only approximately 1.0% before returning to 4.0% growth in 2009. This resilient growth is driven, in part, by the fact that packaging machinery plays a key role in both driving customers’ revenue growth and keeping their costs down. This is illustrated by a recent survey indicating that customers are usually driven by one or more of a limited number of considerations: 48.0% of customers seek to replace equipment and increase productivity, 43.0% seek to increase capacity, 34.0% seek to use the machinery for new product introductions and 28.0% seek to introduce new package formats. In addition, since most customers operate their machinery around the clock, minimizing downtimes is critical to their business as evidenced by a recent market survey, according to which, quality and reliability are the most important purchasing criteria for customers of packaging machinery. The ability to drive revenue growth, keep costs down and the overriding need for quality and reliability, support the view that packaging machinery and the related After-Sales products and services are non-discretionary expenditures for customers and lead to demand resiliency for such products and services in any market cycle. While it is difficult to predict the consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that it may accelerate many of the trends that have historically benefitted our business segments and driven sales of our products and services. In particular, we expect to benefit from (i) a higher focus on health care and well-being due to increased consumption of pharmaceuticals, which in turn increases demand for products, (ii) the acceleration of the trend related to product safety concerns due to further increases in private and governmental interest in labelling and traceability of products and (iii) the acceleration of the trend related to factory automation in order to reduce personnel costs and human interaction which can contribute to the spread of disease, including Covid-19.

Furthermore, thanks to its higher profitability, compared to our Original Equipment business, the After-Sales business has represented, on average, 43.0% of the total gross profit over the same period. The resilience in the After-Sales business is due to the overriding need of customers to avoid downtime, leading to predictable expenditure on spare parts and maintenance (including predictive maintenance) and our ability to deliver After-Sales services remotely. We believe this was evident in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, where revenue from the After-Sales business were seemingly unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and represented 34.0% of our revenue. We also have high visibility of revenue from our Original Equipment business due to our fast-growing Backlog and repeat business from our loyal, diverse and highly-recurring blue-chip customers. Our Backlog has grown from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%, with our Backlog as of December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 equaling 131 ----- €649.9 million, €766.2 million, €806.8 million, €941.5 million, and €909.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2020 our Backlog was €919.4 million. This substantial and increasing Backlog provides several key benefits, including: (i) future visibility of revenue (e.g., we estimate that our Backlog as of September 30, 2020 provided approximately nine months of visibility of revenue); (ii) increasing revenue coverage for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2019, our Backlog as of the end of the year represented 70.0% and 84.0% of the next year’s revenue (i.e., from 2016 to 2019) from contracts with customers; (iii) upfront non-refundable cash payments (up to 30% of our order value is paid upfront by customers, thus locking in future revenue and strongly disincentivizing customers from cancelling their orders); and (iv) an optimally budgeted cost base, tailored in advance on expected future production, thus allowing flexibility in economic or business downturns. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes several blue-chip customers, including AstraZeneca plc, Novartis International AG, Pfizer Inc., Nestlé S.A., Unilever, Alcon, ThermoFischer, GSK, Porsche, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, Rolex, Tetra Pak and Merck, many of whom have been our customers for more than 20 years. Our customers are also spread out geographically, with Italy, the Rest of Europe, Asia & Middle East, North America and the Rest of the World accounting for 12.1%, 35.1%, 22.2%, 19.7% and 10.9% respectively, of the revenue in 2019. These repeat customers provide us with highly recurring revenue from both After-Sales and the Original Equipment sales. For example, within our pharmaceutical segment, while new customers are acquired each year, a large and increasing volume of our sales are derived from existing customers. As a result, our financial results demonstrate solid resiliency to economic cycles on the back of strong repeating business. The chart below shows the evolution of our revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the periods described therein. Note: CAGR ‘05-19 organic revenue and Adj.

We intend to further strengthen these offerings by selling to markets that display multiple attractive competitive dynamics. Our product filling/production machinery are used by companies in the pharmaceutical (across solid forms / pills, and liquid forms /injectables, etc.), tobacco (e.g., e-cigarette parts), and automation/ e-motor production industries. To those companies, we address key purchaser criteria by offering a large number of possible processes and niche machines, customization, an attractive cost per unit, and reliability. This market is attractive to us because it offers high margins, values innovation, has very loyal customers, features many niches and has a highly fragmented competitive landscape. Our primary packaging machinery are used by companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods (e.g., coffee capsules, tea bags, vacuum sealed bags, flex wrapping for food, etc.), and tobacco (e.g., traditional and e-cigarettes) end markets. To those companies, we address key purchaser criteria by offering reliability (particularly in sterile pharmaceutical lines); flexibility for changes to shapes, sizes, 133 ----- and quick changeovers; customization; production speed; and working with limited production space. This market is attractive to us because it (i) offers high margins, (ii) has limited competition, (iii) has repeat customers, (iv) is at the heart of packaging operations, and (v) has relatively complex machinery.

We intend to focus on maintaining our leading position at the forefront of technological advancement in our market. To do so, we plan to continue investing in our R&D activity and maintain around 5.0% of our revenue investment in R&D each year. We believe these investments will pay off as we can exploit market demand that is less price-sensitive, but rather is focused on improvements in technology and time-to-market. We will continue focusing a substantial part of our R&D resources on automation, which we believe will be driven by both changing working habits and new working regimes following the Covid-19 pandemic, which include, but are not limited to, increased remote working. Automation and digitalization are driving machine complexity across all end markets, through increased inclusion of sensors and software as a means to increase machine productivity. In addition, health and safety measures on production lines have led to changes in machinery requirements as businesses adapt to new workspace regulations. We believe our leading position in producing fully automated production lines across a range of end markets, our reputation for quality and innovation, as well as our longstanding relationships with blue-chip customers, positions us to take advantage of these developments. We also intend to dedicate R&D resources to the fast-growing materials handling niche market. Materials handling is the short-distance movement of items within a facility. It is driven largely by e-commerce, which, in many cases, requires fast and efficient movement of items from inventory to distribution vehicles. We believe that dedicating R&D resources to this niche market can provide substantial returns as the need for such machinery continues to grow, especially during and following the Covid-19 pandemic. We will also continue dedicating R&D resources to meet the growing demand for sustainable products stemming from changes in consumer preferences and government regulation. Sustainable products generally feature new packaging materials and formats (e.g., bottle caps that remain attached to bottles, or thinner plastics that require more intricate machinery). Customers typically need new machinery to use these sustainable materials or produce the products. We believe the trend towards sustainable products will continue and we intend to position ourselves to take advantage of this trend by investing in the relevant R&D resources. We also intend to invest internally by employing more engineers and increasing our innovation efforts, for example generating new ideas about packaging that we can propose to customers and enhancing the performance of our machines to make them more competitive on the market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

From 1963, we steadily expanded our product and service offerings through a combination of in-house development and acquisitions. In 1967, we began the production of automatic tea bagging machines, a product for which we are now the market leader. Nearly a decade later, in 1976, we began the production of automatic machines for the packaging of pharmaceutical products by launching our blister packaging machine, thereby expanding our operations to another business segment. During the 1980s, we expanded our geographical presence to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States and Austria with the aim of strengthening our distribution networks. In addition, we continued our growth strategy by completing several bolt-on acquisitions in the Pharmaceutical segment, including CMS, Zanasi, Farmatic, Farmomac, PM System, Cestind and WinPack. After an additional two decades of sustained growth, in 1995 we listed our shares on the Milan Stock Exchange. Since 2001, we have been listed on the STAR (prime quality stocks) segment of the Milan Stock Exchange. The Vacchi family continues to own a controlling equity interest. The listing helped us fund our expansion plan and reinforce our position as a global player through acquisitions in Italy, Germany and India, along with establishing a presence in China and Japan. In addition, the transformation into a public company prompted management to modernize our internal organization, with a view to ensuring sustainable growth. Since the late 2000s, we continued to acquire companies with the goal of acquiring technological capabilities and organize the company to become a leader in its key business segments. In 2008, we acquired the freeze-drying machinery business of the BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems Group, a leader in that market with operations in the Netherlands, the United States, and China. In 2010, we acquired GIMA S.p.A., based near Bologna, Italy, which operated in the automation, coffee, confectionary, personal care, and tobacco markets. In 2011, we acquired Sympak Corazza Group, a dairy and convenience food packaging company, to give us greater exposure to those growing markets. In 2012, we implemented a new organizational structure with two main brands: IMA Industries (machines for the packaging of tea, coffee, food and cosmetic products) and IMA Pharma (machines for the processing and packaging of pharmaceutical products). In 2013, we acquired ILAPAK Group, based in Switzerland, to gain exposure to the flexible packaging business. In 2016, we enhanced our product line and our global presence through the acquisition of the Medtech business of Komax Group, which has plants in Switzerland, the United States, and Malaysia. In 2017, we listed GIMA TT S.p.A. (“GIMA TT”), our subsidiary specialized in packaging for next generation tobacco products, on the Milan Stock Exchange, but, in 2019, we merged with GIMA TT, delisted it and made it the foundation of our Tobacco segment. In 2018, we acquired Tissue Machinery Company (“TMC”), a manufacturer of tissue and personal care products.

Our decades of experience, technical know-how and longstanding relationships with our customers enable us to meet their varied needs. We design bespoke solutions for customers according to their operational, regulatory and safety requirements. Our customers value our customization capabilities, our long-standing and highly reputable engineering expertise and the superior technology and reliability of our products. Our Original Equipment sales generated €927.4 million, €1,041.7 million and €1,122.9 million, or 70.2%, 69.4% and 70.4% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, and €693.9 million or 68.3% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our core product offering is focused on product filling/production and primary packaging machinery, which constitute most attractive steps of packaging processing chain, with the largest value-add and hence, the highest margins. We are also present in certain highly attractive niche markets for secondary packaging and end-of line packaging machinery, which are used in the final steps of the packaging processing chain. _Product Filling/Production. Product filling/production machinery is used in the first step of the_ packaging processing chain. We sell our product filling/production machinery primarily to companies operating in the pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-motor end markets. To customers in the pharmaceutical end market, we sell machinery for the production of solid form pills holders and liquid form/injectable products. To customers in the tobacco end market, we sell machinery for the production of e-cigarette parts. To customers in the e-motor end market, we sell machinery for the production of starters and rotors used in the assembly of electric motors. In addition, such machinery is typically used as part of complex automated production lines which we also design and assemble for certain customers. Customers in these end markets choose their product filling/production machinery primarily based on the ability to meet stringent regulatory and safety requirements, reliability and reputation, in addition to adaptability to a large number of processes, customizability, and cost per production unit. Given these characteristics, product filling/production machinery command highly attractive margins and a very loyal customer base. _Primary Packaging. Primary packaging machinery is used in the second step of the packaging_ processing chain and consists in the production of machinery making the materials that first envelop 136 ----- the relevant products. We sell our primary packaging machinery to companies operating in the pharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer goods end markets. To customers in the pharmaceutical end market, we sell machinery that manufacture the aluminum and plastic sheets that hold pills. To customers in the tobacco end market, we sell machinery that are used to produce packaging for both traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. To customers in the consumer goods end market, we sell machinery that are used in the production of a wide range of products, including coffee capsules, tea bags, vacuum sealed bags, and flexible wrapping for goods. Customers in these end markets choose their products based on safety, regulatory compliance (particularly for pharmaceutical firms that must maintain sterile production lines), reliability, flexibility, capability of integration with the entire packaging production line, customizability, production speed, and size. Given these characteristics, the market for primary packaging machinery is characterized by attractive margins, limited competition, a very loyal customer base, and a high value placed on complex flexible machinery. _Secondary Packaging. Secondary packaging machinery is used in the third step of the packaging_ processing chain and consists of the production of machinery making the materials that are outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent theft or to group primary packaging together. We sell our secondary packaging machinery to companies operating in the pharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer goods end markets. Customers in these end markets choose their products based on production speed, reliability, and the size of the machinery. Given these characteristics, the market for secondary packaging machinery is characterized by much simpler machinery (e.g., there is no need for sterility or cross contamination control) and greater competition. As a result, we focus on select highvalue niches like cartoning, wrapping and labeling of tobacco and pharmaceutical products, which allows us to achieve attractive margins. _End-of-line Packaging. End-of-line packaging machinery is used in the final step of the packaging_ processing chain—the manufacture of and packaging goods from across the spectrum of end markets we serve using large boxes for bulk handling, warehouse storage, transport shipping and distribution to retailers as well as final packaging used for small items (e.g., boxes for individual units of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals). We sell our end-of-line packaging machinery to companies operating in the pharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer goods end markets. Customers in these end markets choose their products based on price, production speed and reliability. Given these characteristics, the market for end-of-line packaging machinery is characterized by greater competition and low customization. Customers often also choose a single supplier for an entire line covering the full packaging processing chain, making their decision on primary packaging capabilities.

These products and services represent non-discretionary expenditures for customers that are looking for high quality, reduction of machine downtime and superior technical support. Our After-Sales business is closely connected to our Original Equipment business, given that an increase in our installed base directly drives an increase in the demand for our After-Sales products and services. Due to the highly bespoke nature of our products and regulatory requirements, our customers typically prefer to use our After-Sales products services rather than relying on third party suppliers. This is particularly evident in highly regulated markets (e.g. pharmaceutical and tobacco), where the technological component, together with quality and reliability, is a strong barrier to entry for competitors. As a result, our After-Sales business is characterized by highly recurring and growing revenue, protected by our strong longstanding relationships with our customers. Our After-Sales business generated €392.8 million, €458.7 million and €472.6 million, or 29.8%, 30.6% and 29.6% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, and €321.9 million or 31.7% of our revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 137 ----- A description of the products and services we offer through our After-Sales business is set forth below: _Traditional Products and Services. The traditional products and services that we offer with respect to_ our previously installed Original Equipment include (i) spare parts, (ii) format parts, (iii) technical assistance and (iv) other services, which represented 41.8%, 20.5%, 32.9% and 4.8% of our AfterSales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Spare parts are replacement mechanical parts that are needed on a recurring basis. Format parts, by contrast, are larger component parts which determine the shape of our customer’s products. Technical assistance services can be varied, but primarily consists of maintenance work on previously installed Original Equipment. We engage in R&D activities tailored to our customers’ needs, in addition to the sale of ordinary and extraordinary spare parts, change parts and improvement kits. We also arrange visits with our engineers at our customers’ facilities in order to inspect the installed machines and to provide basic operational training. Given the importance of our After-Sales business in maintaining a strong relationship with our customers, we are highly focused on training our technicians to be well-equipped to meet customer demands quickly with skilled technical assistance both onsite and remotely. _Industry 4.0 Services. The Industry 4.0 services that we offer include (i) predictive maintenance,_ (ii) operational efficiency improvement and (iii) digital/data services. Predictive maintenance includes the use of built-in sensors that can provide real time wear and tear alert to the customer. Operational efficiency improvement includes consulting services aimed at closing the gap between actual and optimal machine usage. Digital/data services include software upgrading, which are increasingly significant as an increasing number of the Original Equipment that we sell are digitally/sensor-enabled. Approximately 80.0% of the Original Equipment we offer for sale is digitally/sensor-enabled, allowing us to interact with them remotely through a secure connection for maintenance and repairs and to implement specific adjustments when needed. This increasingly large portion of our Original Equipment enables us to deliver high-quality service to our customers irrespective of their location, expedite spare parts and format parts delivery and reduce machine downtimes. This also contributes to reduction in idle work costs since we typically do not need to visit our customers’ premises after we are contacted for technical assistance for certain activities (i.e. software updates, issue assessment and routine checks). If necessary, through our global footprint we can provide on-site services in a relatively short timeframe or major maintenance and/or repairs and upgrades.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

We believe that our R&D competencies, especially for innovative solutions, such as our capabilities to develop highly customized state-of-the art machines, thereby offering higher flexibility and reliability, differentiate us from our competitors. We develop our technology in-house and also assemble in-house, which guarantees continuous process improvement, increased efficiency and worldwide support with the same high standards as in our production facility. We also believe this creates barriers to entry for potential new market participants. Our R&D team works closely with customers in all key areas of product development providing four different responses, based on the level of customization required: (A) when little or no product customization is required, we simply evaluate the request from our customer and reply to the bid with our offer; 138 ----- (B) when one of our customers’ requests a medium to high level of customization and provides us with technical specifications of the product desired, we first undertake a feasibility study, which is usually paid by the customer, to improve the product design or to customize the product set-up. Pricing for the manufacturing of the related machine or line is determined only after the successful completion of the feasibility study; (C) if customization needs are high, we conduct joint research with our customers, offering full support to them and aiming at completing the feasibility study successfully. If product manufacturing eventually proves to be not viable, we seek payment of the research services rendered to the customer; otherwise, if the feasibility study is successful, we will determine a price to provide the relevant machine or line; and (D) finally, we are also a development partner for many of our customers, working with them to develop new products that meet the needs of their own R&D and marketing activities. We have strategically positioned our R&D department inside our production facilities to centralize the development of our advanced technologies, components and process technologies and minimize costs. Our R&D employees also work, on a day-by-day basis, with externally contracted engineers and consultants. We carry out all necessary tests with the aim to ensure the safety operation of our products and to gain valuable insights for further developing and improving our machines and packaging lines. Our R&D efforts also follow the major trends towards enhanced flexibility to allow quick replacement of change parts. As of December 31, 2019, R&D costs amounted to €53.9 million, slightly lower than €55.3 million as of December 31, 2018, representing 3.4% of our revenue. R&D costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented a slight increase compared to €51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and represented 3.7% of our revenue. R&D costs primarily include the research costs incurred on the technological upgrading and normal revamping of standard products. Our approach to R&D expenditure has always been a distinguishing characteristic of our Group and, over the years, has resulted in a strong market position, especially in difficult niches, highly demanding in terms of regulation and safety standards (as opposed to mass market packaging).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

In order to be more focused on our customers’ individual approaches, we have established strong and reliable relationships with customers on a global scale to reflect our customers’ solid international presence. Contracts are individually negotiated with each customer to better adapt to customer’s differing needs, but typically follow one general format. Our broadest agreements are “master supply agreements”, according to which we agree to supply equipment, including secondary equipment as well as related spare parts, change parts and kits; and our “development agreements”, according to which we agree to work consistently with the customer to develop many products for use in their production chain. _Backlog and New Orders Intake_ Our Backlog consists of the contracted future revenue relating to all signed orders for which customers. Our customers pay up to 30% of the total invoice in the early stages of the relationship by paying the first tranche of the agreed price. New orders intake represents the value of orders that are added to the Backlog during the relevant period and also includes cancellations of work or changes to existing contracts already in the Backlog, which helps illustrate our annual Backlog turnover. In particular, when we include the amount of expected revenue and income from a contract in the Backlog, it assumes that each party will satisfy all of its respective obligations under such contract and payments to us under the contract will be made on a timely basis consistently with the relevant payment conditions of each agreement. For contracts that are not for a lump sum, we estimate and 139 ----- update the related Backlog based upon the estimated amount of work to be completed through periodic consultation with the customer. Figures relating to projects for which we have not received purchase orders from customers are not included in the total Backlog. We believe that our Backlog is a helpful indicator of the growth of our Original Equipment business and that it provides a useful trend of information and visibility for our short- and medium-term financial results.

In none of the past three years has any single supplier accounted for any significant percentage and there is no supplier concentration. Our supplier network allows us to keep our capital expenditure and fixed costs base at a minimum and maintain high flexibility, while reducing delivery time and mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices. Our supplier procurement strategy is based on three basic concepts: (i) developing a core supplier base,(ii) supporting the supplier base structure and (iii) focusing on highly strategic projects. We monitor our supplier base carefully to develop a set of core suppliers. We also engage in negotiations with global suppliers to build long-term relationships. Suppliers are selected with the aim to ensure they can provide adequate support to our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we purchase high-volume materials from local sources and develop local maintenance and assistance units to deal with any material and supply concerns. Finally, we involve suppliers early in our new developments to ensure they can provide the materials needed to realize our and our customers’ visions for our strategic projects, developing close cooperation with the key suppliers for such projects. For key components we rely on a network of possible suppliers that allows us to minimize costs and avoid assembly downtime. We purchase our key components from independent suppliers and consider our relationship with them to be strategic for our business. These key components commercial suppliers are leading players worldwide, such as Schneider Electric, Siemens, Stäubli, SKF and SMC. See also “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Industry—We may face disruptions _in our supply chain.”_ We also source from a network of local suppliers in which we have made minority investments.

Our customer base comprises some of the leading companies in the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, as well as some of the largest tea, coffee, dairy and food companies. Customers often operate machinery around the clock and are more sensitive to downtime avoidance than price, hence the primary focus of their purchasing decisions is on reliability and quality. Customers tend to select machinery from manufacturers with good service support, including, among other things, superior technical knowledge and ability to deliver spare parts in a timely manner. Our large, high quality, loyal and long-standing customer base allows us to rely on recurring business from repeat customers and resilience of revenue due to strong order Backlog. In none of the past three years has any customer accounted for any significant percentage and there is no customer concentration with no single customer accounting for more than 2.5% of our revenue in 2019. This is primarily due to (i) complete lines and new machineries representing the main investment for the setup of any industrial plant; (ii) low turnover rate of machinery; and (iii) our ongoing relationship with customers being based mainly on technical support and maintenance. We work with our customers in order to tailor machines and offer a high degree of personalization. Most of the machines sold by us are customized to meet customers’ specific needs. Customization generally involves modification of our standard machines to include functions such as secondary and end-of-line packaging. In the five-year period 2014 to 2019, on average, our top twenty customers have collectively accounted for less than 21% of our annual revenue. Though our customer base is diversified, we provide products and services to major international customers, such as Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Nestlé, Sanofi, Tetrapak, Unilever, Novartis, Alcon, ThermoFischer, GSK, Porsche, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, Rolex and Merck and have maintained relationships with the first eight of these customers for more than 20 years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

This implies that all of our business processes, from preparing bids to providing After-Sales support, are conducted with an extremely low level of repetitiveness. Accordingly, the proper and smooth functioning of these processes depends on the initiative and pro-active approach of the individuals who personally carry them out, and on their ability to work together with everyone else in the organization. Because of this, our employees represent our principal asset (approximately 70.0% of our employees are engineers and specialized technicians) incorporating all of our knowledge and skill. Because the knowledge and skills our employees possess is so valuable to us, we dedicate considerable attention to the proper management of employees, investing heavily and continually in their professional development, adopting an organizational model with a high degree of participation and applying a bonus system based on the rigorous identification and assessment of the skills acquired by each employee.

Our recruitment campaigns may be conducted either directly or through the use of approved recruitment agencies. For junior positions, the process begins at university level with the selection of the best candidates for placements and apprenticeships by our internal assessment center. In any case, in case of vacancies we tend to prioritize internal candidates. _Remuneration and benefits_ Our remuneration system is based on the “pay for performance” principle, designed to encourage and reward high levels of performance, aligning managers’ interests with those of our shareholders by means, for example, of stock option plans. Our remuneration strategy aims to ensure that pay corresponds to the responsibilities of each role and individual performance, optimizing and retaining key resources while remaining in line with national employment legislation. The remuneration system is composed of basic pay, variable short-term compensation (variable annual bonus), additional benefits (such as pension contributions and reimbursement of medical expenses) and variable mid-to-long term compensation (mainly represented by stock option plans).

Our manufacturing facilities and operations are subject to both national and international regulatory regimes. In the member states of the European Union (the “Member States”), the regulatory environment of our business activities is shaped by EU directives and regulations, which are either implemented in the individual Member States through national legislation or have direct application to the states or individuals. In the United States, our facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Regulations that affect our operations mostly relate to areas of environmental protection, product safety and quality, occupational health and safety, industrial hygiene and plant safety. Environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations govern our facilities and our operations, including: (i) the storage, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (ii) water discharges; (iii) air emissions; (iv) human health and safety; (v) the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and of contaminated facilities; and (vi) the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to comply with current and future EHS laws and regulations, which tend to become more stringent over time. Our environmental management systems are intended to ensure that we both comply with applicable environmental requirements and minimize environmental risk. We actively address EHS issues in 144 ----- connection with our operations and properties, and we believe that we have systems in place to ensure that EHS costs and liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on us. Nevertheless, estimates of future EHS costs and liabilities are inherently imprecise, and the imposition of new or unanticipated costs or obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following summary highlights some of the key EHS laws and regulations that apply to our business. _REACH Classification, Labeling and Packaging and Similar Regulations_ The European Union requires control of the use of chemical products within the European Union by imposing on all affected industries the responsibility for ensuring and demonstrating the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. The REACH regulation requires the registration of all chemicals manufactured in or imported into the European Union (either alone, in mixtures or in articles). Although REACH compliance is primarily the responsibility of our suppliers or the producers of chemical raw materials, we are also affected by REACH as a “downstream” user of REACHregulated substances. In the United States, Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) ensures that chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or distributed in commerce, or used or disposed of in the United States do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. Chemicals not listed on the TSCA registry or otherwise exempted cannot be imported into or sold in the United States, until registered with the EPA. TSCA sets forth specific reporting, record keeping and testing rules for chemicals (including requirements for the import and export of certain chemicals), as well as other restrictions relevant to our business. _Air Emissions_ Our U.S. facilities are subject to the Clean Air Act, which addresses threats to human health and the environment from emissions of pollutants into the air. The Clean Air Act establishes air quality standards and sets emission limits principally for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, ground level ozone and sulfur dioxide and regulates the emission of certain designated hazardous air pollutants. It authorizes the EPA to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from major stationary and mobile sources, such as large industrial sources, and phases out the production of substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. Recently, the EPA has also begun to regulate certain greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Our facilities in the European Union are subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (the “EU ETS”), which is an EU-wide system of trading allowances that are issued by Member States to cover industrial GHG emissions and which has been implemented in Germany by the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz) (“TEHG”). Industrial facilities to which the EU ETS applies receive a certain number of allowances to emit greenhouse gases and must surrender one allowance for each ton of greenhouse gases emitted. Facilities that emit fewer tons of greenhouse gases than their allocated allowances cover may sell their excess allowances in the open market, whereas those that emit more than their currently held allowances must buy additional allowances. Further, in respect of our operations in the United Kingdom, we are affected by the UK government’s “Electricity Market Reform” provisions to set a “carbon floor price,” below which the price of CO2 allowances in the UK will not be permitted to fall. _Contamination, Environmental Remediation and Closure Liabilities_ Under the requirements of permits or pursuant to certain EHS laws and regulations we may be required to investigate and remediate contamination at facilities, which we use or have used in the past, particularly if we close an operational facility. In connection with contaminated properties, as well as our operations generally, we also could be subject to claims by government authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury or property damage resulting from hazardous substance contamination or exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products. 145 ----- Spills or releases of hazardous materials, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. We could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and, if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any period in which those costs need to be incurred could be material. Laws and regulations of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate oblige us to prevent contamination of the soil by taking adequate precautions. The relevant governmental authorities may require responsible parties to take remediation measures, or do so themselves, placing the costs for such action on the responsible parties. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (“SARA”), and commonly known as the “Superfund,” as well as similar state laws, govern the remediation of contaminated sites and establish joint and several liability for site owners and individuals and entities responsible for disposing of or releasing hazardous substances at, or operating, such sites. In some cases, a party that sent waste to a contaminated site can be held liable for the entire cost of remediation regardless of fault, the lawfulness of disposal or the actions of other parties.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770
143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.21,Regulation,212.21.2,Tobacco-Related Regulation,"The regulation of tobacco and tobacco packaging has intensified in recent years in response to public health concerns, but regulation varies across the jurisdictions in which our clients operate due to a variety of legal, political, economic and social factors. In Europe, the European Parliament and European Council adopted Directive 2014/40/EU concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products (the “Tobacco Directive”) in 2014 aimed to improve the functioning of the internal market for tobacco and related products. On October 9, 2015, the European Commission adopted regulation specifying the content, size, color, font and position of the health warnings on the packages. Some European nations, including Italy, have adopted further measures to enhance the protection of minors. In the United States, the FDA has broad powers to regulate the production, sale and marketing of tobacco-based products. One rule requires any new tobacco-based product that is not “substantially equivalent” to a product on the market as of February 2007 to undergo an expensive approval process. In 2016, the FDA’s authority was extended its authority to electronic cigarettes, cigars and other related products, which may significantly change the electronic cigarette market in the United States. In China, state control of the tobacco industry, together with the central role of cigarette consumption in the Chinese society, have traditionally favored more permissive tobacco regulation compared to other countries. In recent years, however, a more restrictive approach to the industry has emerged, partly linked to the change of political leadership in the Chinese government.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

OSHA’s “general duty” clause requires an employer to furnish to its 146 ----- employees a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. In addition to the federal standards, states may design their own job safety and health programs, as long as they are at least as effective as the federal standards. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires chemical processers to employ a hazard communication program utilizing labels and other forms of warnings, as well as material safety data sheets, setting forth safety and hazardous materials information to employees and customers. OSHA’s hazard communication standard covers both physical hazards (such as flammability or the potential for explosions) and health hazards. Employers must provide their employees with a minimum level of training on proper chemical handling procedures. Our U.S. facilities provide basic training to employees and visitors who have access to chemical handling areas. Under OSHA, we also must conduct workplace assessments to determine whether hazards are present that require the use of personal protective equipment. If such hazards are present, we must provide appropriate equipment to our employees at our cost and expense, and must require employees to use such protective equipment. OSHA also establishes workplace chemical exposure levels for indoor air quality.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The Enhanced Voting Rights cease in the event of transfer of the relevant shares including, inter alia, in case of creation of a pledge, usufruct or other liens over the shares, to the extent any such transaction entails the loss of voting rights of the transferor. The Enhanced Voting rights do not cease in case the shares are transferred upon death of the shareholder or in case of donation in favor of statutory heirs or for the creation and/or the functioning of a trust or of a family trust or a foundation which the transferor or his/her statutory heirs benefit from, as the successors in title are entitled to request the registration with the same registration seniority of the individual legal predecessor.

Each director’s term cannot be longer than three financial years, expiring on the date of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the financial statements for the last of the three financial years of appointment. Directors may be re-appointed and serve multiple terms. At the relevant ordinary shareholders’ meeting, prior to the appointment of directors, the shareholders resolve upon the number of directors and the term of their office. According to Article 15 of the by-laws, the directors are appointed at the shareholders’ meeting with reference to lists presented by the shareholders. The lists must expressly state which directors meet the requirements for being considered independent under applicable laws and regulations. Each candidate may only be present on one list or, otherwise, will be ineligible for election. Lists may only be presented by shareholders who alone or together with other shareholders own at least 2.5% (two point five percent) of the Company’s voting share capital, or such different threshold as is established by law or the regulations (including, in particular, the regulations approved by CONSOB; in this respect, pursuant to CONSOB Determination No. 28 of January 30, 2020 adopted pursuant to articles 144-quater and 144-septies of the Issuers’ Regulations, with regard to the capitalization of the Company, the (lower) percentage of the share capital required to present lists of candidates to the Board of Directors of the Company is currently 1%). The Board of Directors will specify the ownership threshold required for the presentation of lists of candidates in the notice that calls the shareholders’ meeting held to appoint the directors. Each shareholder acting directly, or via an intermediary or a trust company, may contribute to the presentation of, just one list and may vote for just one list. Lists containing a number of candidates equal to or greater than three must be composed of candidates belonging to both genders, so that a percentage equal to that required by the applicable Italian laws and regulations concerning gender balance for the composition of the Board of Directors 159 ----- belongs to the less represented gender. The lists, accompanied by the professional curricula of each nominated person and signed by the shareholders presenting them, must be filed at the Company’s registered offices within the 25[th] day preceding the ordinary shareholders meeting called to appoint the directors. The shareholder submitting the list must also file with the Company a specific certification, issued by a legal authorized intermediary and evidencing the title to the minimum number of shares required for the submission of a list. On the completion of voting, the candidates on the two lists that obtained the largest number of votes are elected, on condition that these obtain a percentage of votes at least equal to half of the percentage of capital required for the submission of lists, to be determined at the time of voting, on the following basis: (a) the number of directors drawn from the list that obtains the largest number of votes (the “Majority",N/A,as_expected,2021,770
143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.39,List”) is one less than the total number of members of the Board of Directors established,212.39.1,,"previously by the shareholders’ meeting; within this numeric limit, the candidates are elected in the numerical order in which they appear on the list; and (b) one director, being the first candidate on the list, is drawn from the list obtaining the second largest number of votes that is not related in any way, directly or indirectly, with the shareholders who submitted or voted for the Majority List (the “Minority List”). In the event of a tie between two or more lists, the candidates are drawn using the highest averages method and, in case of a tie between two candidates, the candidate is drawn from the list from which less candidates have been appointed; where two or more lists have expressed the same number of candidates, the oldest candidate shall be eventually appointed. If only one list is submitted, all the Directors will be elected from such list. If no list is submitted the ordinary shareholders’ meeting will resolve by legal majority, without following the procedure summarized above. All of the foregoing is subject to compliance with the applicable laws and regulations’ provisions concerning the composition of the Board of Directors (including independence requirements and gender balance), as reflected in the by-laws of the Company from time to time. _Board of Statutory Auditors_ Pursuant to Article 23 of the by-laws, the Board of Statutory Auditors comprises of three standing statutory auditors and three alternate auditors, who may be re-elected. Their duties and term in office are those established by current legislation. Statutory auditors are appointed using the list-voting procedures described in the law and current regulations, to ensure the compliance with regulatory gender balance requirements in accordance with Article 148 paragraph 1-bis of Decree 58/1998 and to ensure that the minority shareholders can appoint one standing statutory auditor and one alternate auditor. The lists presented have two sections: one for the appointment of standing statutory auditors and the other for the appointment of alternate auditors. Lists having three or more candidates are required to have candidates of both genders, in accordance with applicable regulatory gender balance requirements. Candidates are listed in numerical sequence and the list must indicate whether each candidate is running as standing statutory auditor or alternate auditor. Lists may only be presented by shareholders who alone or together with other shareholders own at least 2.5% (two point five percent) of the shares with voting rights, or such different threshold as is established under applicable law and regulations (including, in particular, the regulations approved by CONSOB; in this respect, pursuant to CONSOB Determination No. 28 of January 30, 2020 adopted pursuant to articles 144-quater and 144-septies of the Issuers’ Regulations, with regard to the capitalization of the Company, the (lower) percentage of the share capital required to present lists of candidates to the Board of Directors of the Company is currently 1%). The Board of Directors will specify the ownership threshold required for the presentation of lists of candidates in the notice that calls the shareholders’ meeting held to appoint the statutory auditors. Each shareholder acting directly, or via an intermediary or a trust company, may contribute to the presentation of, just one list and may vote for just one list. 160 ----- Two standing statutory auditors and two alternate auditors are drawn from the list that obtains the largest number of votes, while one standing statutory auditor and one alternate auditor is drawn from the list obtaining the second largest number of votes that is not related in any way, directly or indirectly, with the shareholders who submitted or voted for the majority list, in both cases in accordance with the numerical sequence indicated in the list. In the event of a voting tie involving two or more lists, pursuant to Article 23 of the by-laws, without prejudice to the laws and regulations in respect of gender balance requirements, the oldest candidates shall be appointed as auditors. Should the above procedure not ensure that the composition of the Board of Statutory Auditors is compliant with applicable gender balance requirements, the elected candidates of the majority list will be replaced so as to ensure compliance with gender balance requirements. The statutory auditor drawn from the minority list will be the Chairman. If just one list is presented, all the candidates from such list will be elected. If no list is submitted, the ordinary shareholders’ meeting will resolve by legal majority. 161 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility, the Guarantee Facility, the Bridge Facility, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees or security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “transfer pricing”, “ thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “ liquidity impairment” rules, rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/or the Guarantor will not opt (where possible) for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to article 15 and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended and supplemented from time to time. Accordingly, security that requires payment in Italy of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligations will not be taken unless it can be executed by way of exchange of correspondence. Non-Italian Security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligation will not be taken if tax duty cannot be minimized upon execution, Guarantees and Security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount agreed between the Security Agent and the Issuer;

provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; - the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group, in relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, shall use reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit; - the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all the secured creditors); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel debt” provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents) and in no event will “parallel debt” provisions apply to transaction security documents governed by Italian law or guarantees provided by members of the Group incorporated in Italy;

Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph. For so long as the applicable series of Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less than ten (10) nor more than 60 days prior to the_ redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent). For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. Such notice of redemption may instead be published on the website of Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). If any series of Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such series of Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note, or otherwise in accordance with the then-existing procedures of the relevant clearing system, to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, the applicable series of Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.

Such Change in Tax Law must be both formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment on the Notes or any Notes Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

(2) any Tax, to the extent that such Tax is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor or Paying Agent addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction is payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so; (3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

If obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request, and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date the is 30 days prior to the payment date).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, in accordance with the thenapplicable procedures of the relevant clearing system, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the Issuer, mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased 231 ----- portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not or will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. Subject to the limitations discussed herein, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” and, in the case of Consolidated Total Secured_ Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Bridge Facility, the Revolving Facility Agreement and/or Guarantee Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Bridge Facility, the Revolving Facility Agreement and/or Guarantee Facility Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees _and the Notes Collateral—The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_ 232 ----- _additional financing to pay amounts that might become due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default, at final maturity or upon a change of control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer to specified other persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent); _provided that notwithstanding anything in the Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any_ Indebtedness, the Issuer may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such Indebtedness; and further provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, prior to a Delisting only, no Indebtedness may be Incurred by Target or the Target Restricted Subsidiaries under the first paragraph of this covenant, but without prejudice to any other basket or threshold set out in this covenant. If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken, in reliance on any ratio-based basket or permission (including but not limited to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio) such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of and without including any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or any credit facility available for redrawing (however so described or structured).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture, provided that, if at the date of any definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Issuer) the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is (a) greater than 4.00 to 1.00, (b) less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 but greater than 3.50 to 1.00 or (c) less than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00, 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition in the case of clause (a), 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition in the case of clause (b), and 0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition in the case of clause (c), shall be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds.

The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 365 day period mentioned in this covenant. An Asset Disposition Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantees. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Disposition Offer as the result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the heading “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments as defined under “—Limitation on _Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period_ and, accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to_ take any action described in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the_ Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the_ Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. In addition, any future obligation to grant further Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee if the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

or_ (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross _acceleration provision”),_ and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment defaults or accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the greater of (x) €61.3 million and (y) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA; (5) save as governed by either the second or third paragraphs of this covenant, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (each, a “Material Entity”) (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Transaction Security Documents (or a security interest under the Escrowed Property) having a fair market value in excess of the greater of (x) €45.9 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Escrow Charge, the Escrow Agreement or any other Notes Document) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days (the “security default provision”);

and (9) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Redemption on the Special Redemption Date as described above under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Redemption.” However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of the first paragraph of this section will not constitute an Event of Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes has notified the Issuer of the Default and (ii) the Issuer has not cured such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice, provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken and reported publicly and/or to the Holders, more than two (2) years prior to such notice of Default. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, subject to the provisions of the next paragraph, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued 266 ----- and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant) or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant) (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing _Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the_ Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being treated as if such Directing Holder had participated in the same proportion as all other Noteholder Direction participations that were made by Directing Holders who are not in breach of their Position Representations or Verification Covenant; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been 267 ----- insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as the Trustee may determine in good faith (provided that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud). The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any derivatives or Net Short position or otherwise. If a Default occurs for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time periods prescribed in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to its rights and benefits under the Indenture for actions in respect of Defaults or Events of Default that are subsequently cured or annulled; provided 268 ----- that the Trustee’s conduct is otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and does not constitute willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received indemnification or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability, cost or expense (including certain legal fees). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4) or (6) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4) or (6) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability, cost or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee or any Agent in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including its legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of the first fiscal year of the Issuer ending after the Issue Date and within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year ending thereafter, an Officer’s Certificate: (i) confirming whether the Issuer is aware of any Default that occurred during the previous year, and (ii) if the Issuer is aware of one or more Defaults which have occurred during the previous year, specifying such Default and, to the extent such Default is continuing as of the date of such Officer’s Certificate, what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will also provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after becoming aware of the occurrence thereof (unless waived or cured during such time period), written notice in the form of an Officer’s Certificate of any event that has occurred and is continuing which would constitute a Default, its status, and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. 269 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests. In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes (subject to receipt of the same from the Issuer), registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time on the register maintained by the Registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes. In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are 331 ----- financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the relevant Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 332 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts) (together with ERISA Plans, (“Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (“Similar Law”).

The Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains, subject to certain conditions. In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva on capital gains, the above-mentioned taxpayers may opt, under certain conditions, for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax Declaration Regime_ Under the “tax declaration” regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the ordinary regime for taxation of capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any incurred capital loss, realized by the Italian-resident individual pursuant to all sales or redemptions of the Notes carried out during any given tax year. Such Italian-resident individuals must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return and pay the imposta sostitutiva on such gains together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains of the same nature realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Risparmio amministrato regime_ As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian-resident individuals not holding the Notes in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the imposta sostitutiva separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (the risparmio amministrato regime 339 ----- provided for by Article 6 of Decree No. 461/1997). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: (a) the Notes being deposited with Italian banks, SIMs or certain authorized financial intermediaries (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediaries); and (b) a valid express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being punctually made in writing by the relevant holder of the Notes. The depository is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any relevant incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the taxpayer, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes or using funds provided by the holder of the Notes for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted only from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the holder of the Notes is not required to declare the capital gains or losses in its annual tax return. _Risparmio gestito regime_ Any capital gains derived by Italian-resident individuals not holding the Notes in connection with an entrepreneurial activity who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary and have opted for the so-called “risparmio gestito” regime, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Under the risparmio gestito regime, any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the risparmio gestito regime, the noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income tax (including imposta sostitutiva to the rate of 26 percent) if the Noteholder is an Italian resident individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activity and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act 2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of the Finance Act 2019, and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from 1 January 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The Notes are included in the definition of financial products for these purposes. Communications and reports are deemed to be sent at least once a year even if the Italian financial intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or send such communications and reports. In this case, the stamp duty is to be applied on 31 December of each year or in any case at the end of the relationship with the client. At any rate, where no specific exemption applies, a minimum stamp tax of Euro 34.20 is due on a yearly basis. Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the MEF on May 24, 2012, the 0.20% stamp duty does not apply to communications and reports that the Italian financial intermediaries send to investors who do not qualify as “clients” according to the regulations issued by Bank of Italy. Communications and reports sent to this type of investors are subject to the ordinary €2.00 stamp duty for each copy. Moreover, the proportional stamp duty does not apply to communications sent to Pension Funds. The taxable base of the 0.20% stamp duty is the market value or, in the lack thereof, the nominal value or the redemption amount of any financial product or financial instrument (including the Notes). The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000 per year if the Notes are held by noteholders other than individuals. Stamp duty applies both to Italian-resident noteholders and to non-Italian-resident noteholders, to the extent that the Notes are held with an Italian-based financial intermediary (and not directly held by the noteholders outside Italy, in which case Italian wealth tax (see below under “Wealth Tax on Notes Deposited Abroad (IVAFE)”) applies to Italian-resident noteholders only).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures.

The following summary addresses only U.S. Holders (as defined herein) who purchase the Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This summary does not address the tax consequences to subsequent purchasers of the Notes. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. The discussion below does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax), nor does it address any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address tax consequences to U.S. Holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark to market, insurance companies, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated financial transaction, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S Holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement or U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar.

In such event, U.S. Holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when principal payments are made on the Note. In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note (“Accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the Accrued OID for each prior accrual period. 347 ----- For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes as of the issue date.

If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such taxable disposition, the amount realized by a U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of the disposition (or based on the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market and taxably disposed of by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the “U.S. dollar cost” (as defined herein) of the Note to such holder increased by any previously Accrued OID and decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified stated interest. The “U.S. dollar cost” of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (or based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described in the two previous paragraphs, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S. source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and Accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount”, as applicable.

U.S. Holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under Proposed Treasury Regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these Proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually paid or received within five Business Days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. 353 ----- The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied, through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes”._ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be eleven Business Days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+11“). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two Business Days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next nine succeeding Business Days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes”._ The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Some of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates were lenders to the Company and have been repaid as part of the Transactions. Each of the Initial Purchasers (or one of their affiliates) is a lender under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility and will receive proceeds from the Notes in repayment thereof. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies have engaged, and may in the future engage, in lending, advisory, investment banking, corporate finance services, commercial banking transactions and/or other commercial dealings with, and may provide services to, us and our affiliates, in the ordinary course of business to the Issuer (including its parent and group companies), 354 ----- the Company (including its parent and group companies) and/or to companies directly and/or indirectly involved in the Transactions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer, the Company, or their affiliates and/or to companies directly and/or indirectly involved in the Transactions. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

However, pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3. Such court’s decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. The COMI is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), paragraph 2, provides, in most cases, for a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the jurisdiction where its registered office is located. In order to prevent 359 ----- fraudulent or abusive forum shopping, such presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request of the opening of insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the presumption shall not apply, and the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company will be the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the company had its registered office before moving it. Specifically, Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to the COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the COMI of a company is, at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings located in the same Member State as its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. As noted in Preamble 10, Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation has been extended to include insolvency proceedings that promote the rescue of economically viable but financially distressed businesses (such as, with respect to Italian insolvency proceedings, restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di _ristrutturazione),_ crisis resolution process of the consumer overindebtedness (procedure _di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento del consumatore) and winding-up (liquidazione dei beni))._ Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State in which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

If the COMI of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. “Establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose 360 ----- claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment opening insolvency proceedings of the court commencing proceedings (subject to any public policy exception). The judgment of the court commencing main proceedings will produce the same effects in the other Member States (other than Denmark) as under the law of the Member State (other than Denmark) commencing main proceedings, so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State and subject to certain other exceptions (e.g. rights in rem situated in another Member State remain subject to the original law governing that right). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in the Member State, which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings, may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency receiver in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency receiver must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law and from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceeding was opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Recently a comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency laws and of the regulation of overindebtedness crises has been introduced (“2019 Reform”). In particular, the Italian Senate approved Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017, pursuant to which it has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of Italian insolvency laws and, in particular, the Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented and currently in force (the “Italian",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Until that date, insolvency proceedings will",2448.6.1,Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations,"_Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Applicable Prior to Implementation of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency_ The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Transaction Security Providers are incorporated in the Republic of Italy and, in the event of an insolvency event affecting any of these entities, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Italy. In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process and in-court procedures may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. Apart from the 2019 Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law was repeatedly amended in the past years. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reform has been approved by the Italian Government on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by Law No. 132/2015 (the “Law 132/2015”). Law 132/2015 entered into force on August 21, 2015. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the 362 ----- “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, state of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall or, more generally, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition, the following forms of debt restructuring and bankruptcy are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (concordati stragiudiziali) Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento _attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery_ of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed by the debtor has to verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor subsequently declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions: (i) are not subject to claw-back action; and (ii) are exempted from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed (although publication in the companies’ register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law Out-of-court agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts can be ratified by the court. An independent expert 363 ----- appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within 120-day term from: (i) the date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor from the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. In such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and, if they are, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that an independent expert certifies the homogeneity of the classes and subject to certain conditions being met. The purpose is to prevent financial creditors with modest credits from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed financial creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. 364 ----- Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. The debtor may also enter into a standstill agreement with its creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries by which also the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries are bound, provided that: (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith; and (ii) an expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, paragraph 3, letter (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the standstill agreement. The banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the standstill agreement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days after having been notified of the same. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the standstill agreement may impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on third party creditors. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoys priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement. Pursuant to Article 182-quinquies, paragraphs 1 and 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, after filing of an agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1 or of a petition pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of a petition pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 1 or 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) described below), the court may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur new super-senior (so called prededucibile) indebtedness, subject to an expert certifying that such financing is functional to the averall restructuting process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem security (garanzie reali) or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), issued a report in which they declare that the new financial indebtedness aims to achieve a better satisfaction of the creditors. The provision of Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato _preventivo) outlined below._ Furthermore, according to Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of a petition pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) described below), also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super-senior (so called pre-deducibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds; and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor. 365 ----- Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) A company which is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e. financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, _inter alia, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the_ composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato _preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before_ the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato _preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._ The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it shall ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the above-mentioned period. The debtor may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published the following day in the company’s register. 366 ----- Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible, and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super-senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called pre-deducibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice _delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and_ calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote, and also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The _concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of_ the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via e-mail) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the _concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo_ 367 ----- provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the receivables giving the right to vote or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court opens a competitive bidding process. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti _ancora_ _ineseguiti_ _o_ _non _compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the_ above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso _abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be_ filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo. Bankruptcy (fallimento) A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) and the judicial liquidation of the debtor’s assets can be filed by the debtor itself, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the debtor (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi _lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and_ (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. 368 ----- Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings: (a) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; (b) the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets pass from the debtor to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); (c) any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made) is ineffective against the creditors; (d) continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and (e) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare) A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the _concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of_ their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. 369 ----- Statutory Priorities The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Avoidance Powers in Insolvency Under Italian law, there are “clawback” or avoidance provisions that may lead to, inter alia, the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions that are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions that are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. (a) Acts ineffective by operation of law (1) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without needing to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law; and (2) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if made by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. (b) Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court _commissioner_ (1) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian 370 ----- Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency: (i) the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25% the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure preexisting debts which have not yet fallen due; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due. (2) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and (ii) the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration. (3) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner; (iii) a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di _risanamento attestato (see “—Out-Of-Court Reorganization Plans (piani di risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above);_ (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a _concordato preventivo (see “—Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)” above) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti_ under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt Restructuring _Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above) and transactions entered into, payments_ made and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato _preventivo (see above);_ (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and (vii) a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, 371 ----- _provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into_ prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g. gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale—“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter _alia, on insolvency matters to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19_ pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, on April 8, 2020, the Italian Government enacted the Restore Liquidity Decree, which provides businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with a package of financial assistance designed to help Italian businesses survive the dramatic short term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which has been converted into law on June 4, 2020. The Restore Liquidity Decree contains measures to relieve enterprises from certain obligations or procedures that could trigger adverse effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions. One set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/ pre-insolvency scenarios. These measures provide that: (i) the rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply from the date on which the Restore Liquidity Decree comes into force until December 31, 2020 with reference to events occurred in the financial years closed by December 31, 2020. This measure, provided for by Article 6 of the Restore Liquidity Decree, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations; (ii) directors are allowed to prepare year-end financial statements in 2020 under a going concern assumption, to the extent the company’s status as a going concern was ascertained with reference to the preceding financial statements closed before the entry into force of lockdown measures (i.e., February 23, 2020). According to Article 7 of the Restore Liquidity Decree, such provision is applicable also to year-end financial statements closed before February 23, 2020 but still not approved. The government has acknowledged that, in the current unprecedented circumstances, directors of a significant number of companies would not have been in a position to confirm the going concern assessment underpinning the on-going preparation of financial statements (with the ensuing liquidation procedures). Therefore, this measure eliminates the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on items recorded in the financial statements while allowing companies to approve year-end financial statements on time; (iii) the repayment of loans made to companies in a situation of economic and financial imbalance by shareholders or by those who exercise management and coordination activities in the period from 372 ----- the date on which the Restore Liquidity Decree comes into force until December 31, 2020, will not be subordinated to the satisfaction of other creditors. This measure, introduced by Article 8 of the Restore Liquidity Decree, applies in reliance upon an exemption from 2467 and 2497-quinquies of the Italian Civil Code; and (iv) no proceedings for the declaration of insolvency or bankruptcy can be brought or pursued between March 9, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Insolvent companies will have time during this period to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business and to pursue alternative routes, if any. The measure, introduced by Article 10 of the Restore Liquidity Decree, applies across the board (i.e., to filings initiated by the debtor, the creditors or the public prosecutor, except for (i) filings initiated by the relevant debtor if the insolvency is not due to the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) bankruptcy filings initiated by anyone pursuant to article 162, paragraph 2, article 173, paragraphs 2 and 3, and article 180, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) filings initiated by the public prosecutor requesting the application of interim or precautionary measures to protect the assets of the debtor). To mitigate the potential negative effects of this suspension to the creditors of the distressed company, the limitation period applicable to claw-back actions (i.e., three years from the declaration of bankruptcy and five years from the date of completion of the relevant transactions) and for the declaration of insolvency (i.e., one year since the cancellation from the relevant companies’ register) are also suspended for an equal period. The Restore Liquidity Decree also addresses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), agreements for crisis composition (accordi di composizione della crisi) and consumers’ plans (piani del consumatore) through the following measures, prescribed by Article 9 of the Restore Liquidity Decree: (i) a six-month extension of the term for performance of connected obligations falling after February 23, 2020; (ii) in the event of proceedings for the approval of pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreements with creditors pending on February 23, 2020, debtors have, before the approval hearing, the power to: (a) ask the competent court for extensions to prepare and submit to the court new plans and arrangements / proposals for compositions in on-going procedures. The new term cannot exceed 90 days starting from the date of the relevant decree by which the court assigns the new term and cannot subsequently be extended; and (b) file a statement indicating the new terms for the fulfilment of the composition plan or restructuring agreement, provided that the deferment of these terms cannot exceed six months from initial deadlines. (iii) in case of proceedings so-called con riserva or in bianco, for which the competent court has already granted debtors the deadline for the submission of the composition plan or restructuring agreement, the aforesaid debtors have the right to apply to the court for a further 90 days extension of the deadline for filing, for supervening reasons arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevant courts may grant such extensions in cases where the application is based on objective and legitimate grounds. Furthermore, in case of a bankruptcy proceeding, the term of 60 days (extendable of further 60 days) provided for the deposit by the debtor of the documentation regarding the concordato in bianco, does not apply to the extent the request by the debtor for the concordato in bianco has been deposited by December 31, 2021; and (iv) debtors that, by December 31, 2021, obtained under procedures for pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreements extension terms as provided under Article 161, paragraph 6, or Article 182-bis, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, may, by such terms, deposit a deed whereby they quit the relevant procedure and declare that they prepared an out of court reorganization plans (piano di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. An Introduction to the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency The Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency substantially reformed the Italian Bankruptcy Law by setting out a unified and systematic set of rules for the implementation of an organic reform of the principles and rules applicable to the effects of corporate crises and insolvency. 373 ----- Certain provisions came into force on March 16, 2019 (e.g., provisions on Directors’ liability), certain others should have entered into force from August 14, 2020. Due to the epidemiological emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 5 of the Restore Liquidity Decree postponed the entry into force of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency to September 1, 2021. Furthermore, by means of Law dated March 8, 2019, no. 20, the Italian Parliament delegated to the Government the adoption of supplementary and corrective provisions of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency to be implement through the issuing of one or more legislative decrees. Therefore, it is likely that the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency may be further amended before its final entry into force. The main changes introduced by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency are (i) warning instruments and assisted crisis resolution process; (ii) the introduction of a notion of Group insolvency; (iii) amendments to the rules governing out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento), courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione) and the bankruptcy proceeding (now called liquidazione _giudiziale) and (iv) renaming of the bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) into judicial liquidation_ (liquidazione giudiziale). Warning instruments (strumenti di allerta) and assisted crisis resolution process (procedimento di _composizione assistita della crisi)_ Warning instruments are a critical innovation set forth by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, given that they do not affect companies only in time of crisis, but also during their whole life cycle. Such warning instruments (strumenti di allerta) aim at, together with the organizational obligations imposed on the debtor by the Civil Code (Article 2086 as amended by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), promptly detecting signs of crisis in the debtor and at immediately adopting the measures best suited to its composition. Specifically the corporate control bodies, the auditor and the auditing firm, each within the scope of its functions, are obliged to: (i) verify that the administrative body constantly evaluates, taking the appropriate initiatives, whether the organizational structure of the debtor is adequate; (ii) check whether there is economic and financial equilibrium and what is the foreseeable trend of the management; and (iii) immediately report to the Board of Directors the presence of well-founded indications of the existence of a crisis. The report will be in writing and sent by certified electronic mail or, in any case, by means that ensure proof of receipt, and will, additionally, contain the setting of a reasonable period, not exceeding 30 days, within which the administrative body is to report on the solutions identified and the initiatives undertaken. In case of omissions or inadequate responses, or failure to adopt, in the subsequent 60 days, the measures deemed necessary to overcome the crisis, the aforementioned people will inform without delay the Organismo di Composizione della Crisi di Impresa (“OCRI”), providing every element useful for its determinations. Further obligations in monitoring companies and reporting to the OCRI rest upon the Revenue Agency, the National Social Security Institute and the Collection Agent. The OCRI is established at each Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Arts and Agriculture (CCIAA), with the task of receiving the reports referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, managing the alert procedure and assisting the debtor, at his request, in the procedure of assisted composition of the crisis. The OCRI will work through the “contact person,” who will be the Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, or his delegate, as well as through the contact person’s office, which may also be formed in an associated form by several chambers of commerce. Within 15 working days from the receipt of the report or from the debtor’s instance, the OCRI will summon for a confidential hearing, before a council appointed for specifically for the procedure, the debtor and, in the case of a debtor with a supervisory body, the members of the supervisory body. Pursuant to Article 18 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency when the OCRI detects the existence of a crisis, it identifies with the debtor the possible measures to remedy it and sets the deadline within which the debtor must report on their implementation. In accordance with Article 19 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, at the request of the debtor, the council will set a time limit for reaching an agreement with respect to the solution of the crisis. Such time limit is set at three months, which may be extended for additional three months if negotiations are leading to a solution to the crisis. When the debtor applies for the approval of agreements to restructure debts or to open an arrangement with creditors, the council proceeds, at the request of the debtor, to certify the 374 ----- truthfulness of the debtor’s data. The arrangement produces the same effects as the agreement that implements the out-of-court reorganization plan and, at the request of the debtor and with the consent of the creditors concerned, is filed in the commercial register. If, on expiry of the aforementioned period, no agreement has been reached with the creditors concerned and a situation of crisis persists, the previously mentioned council will invite the debtor to apply for access to one of the procedures described in the following paragraphs (i.e., accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti, concordato preventivo and liquidazione giudiziale)._ If the debtor fails to comply with the above invitation, the council, if it considers that the elements acquired make it clear that the debtor is in a state of insolvency, will report this in a reasoned report to the contact person who will inform the public prosecutor at the competent court thereof, who could, in turn, file for a judicial liquidation, should the necessary prerequisites be sussistent. Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are still based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento _attestati) prepared by a company to restructure its indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of its_ financial condition. According to Article 56, an independent expert appointed by the debtor has to certify to the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the debtor. The recovery plan must: (i) have a certain date; (ii) be in written form; (iii) have an analytical content with the specification, aimed at avoiding opportunistic or collusive conduct, that even unilateral acts or executive contracts must be proven in writing and must have a certain date. At the debtor’s request the plan can be published in the commercial register (this would allow for certain tax benefits). The content of the plan will also indicate, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 56 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency: (i) the economic and financial situation of the debtor and indication of such debtor’s asset; (ii) the main causes of the crisis; (iii) intervention strategies and the time needed to ensure the rebalancing of the financial situation; (iv) the creditors and the amount of claims for which a renegotiation is proposed and the status of each negotiation; (v) new financial contributions; and (vi) the timing of the actions to be carried out, which make it possible to verify their implementation, as well as the instruments to be adopted in case of any deviation between the objectives and the current situation. The terms and conditions of these plans are still freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-judicial insolvency agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans, pursuant to Article 56 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, do not offer the debtor any protection from enforcement proceedings or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. Should these plans fail and the debtor subsequently be subject to judicial insolvency, Italian insolvency laws provide that, subject to certain conditions, the payments or acts carried out to implement the reorganization plan are not subject to clawback action (paragraph 3(d) of Article 166 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency) and are exempt from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency Agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s outstanding debts have not particularly changed with the introduction of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. They still have to be ratified by the court and an independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the debtor. Moreover, such expert must also declare that the agreement is feasible and ensure that the debts of non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within 120 days from: (i) the date the court validates the agreement, in the case of debts which are due and payable to non-participating creditors as of the date of the court validates the debt restructuring agreement (omologazione); and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts is due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to non-participating creditors as of the date the court validates the debt restructuring agreement 375 ----- (omologazione). Only a debtor who is in a state of crisis (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) or insolvent can initiate this process and request the court to validate the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors (omologazione). If the debtor has so requested in the application referred to in Article 40 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, from the date of its publication in the commercial register, creditors by reason of preceding title or cause cannot, under penalty of nullity, begin or continue executive and precautionary actions on the debtor’s assets. From the same date, the statute of limitations remains suspended and the forfeiture does not occur. These protective measures may be required by the debtor also during the negotiations and before the filing of the application for the approval of the agreements on restructuring, by including the documentation referred to in Article 57 and the proposal for an agreement accompanied by a statement from the independent professional certifying that the proposal is in progress with creditors representing at least 60% of the total and that it, if accepted, is eligible for ensuring the full payment of creditors with whom they are not in negotiations or have otherwise denied their own willingness to negotiate. The percentage referred to in Article 57 (60% of the debtor’s outstanding debt) will be reduced by half when the debtor: (i) does not propose a moratorium on creditors who are not parties to the agreements; and (ii) has not requested, and refrains from requesting, protective measures. Aside from an indication of the elements of the business plan which enable it to be implemented, the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency does not include express provisions concerning the contents of a debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either that the debtor or a third party continue the business or that the business be sold to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for partial or deferred payment of certain taxes, pursuant to Article 63 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from its publication in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled any oppositions, validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed, in accordance with Article 51 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, within 30 days of its publication. Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on dissenting creditors of the same category (a so-called “cramdown”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that dissenting creditors are not treated worse than under any other available alternative. The law also mandates that (i) the agreement will be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement will provide for the continuation of the business activity directly or indirectly pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 84 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, (iii) creditors are satisfied to a significant extent or mainly from the proceeds of the going concern, and (iv) that dissenting creditors have been properly and timely informed and provided with all the necessary documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it. A special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness, in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of such creditors who have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend its effect to non-participating creditors who are part of the same class. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if the creditors’ satisfaction does not come from the proceeds of the going concern. Similarly, pursuant to Article 62 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind non-participating creditors, provided that an independent expert certifies the homogeneity of the classes and that certain further conditions are met (e.g., there has to be a real prospect that creditors in the same category who are not part of the agreement, but to whom the effects of the agreement are extended, will be satisfied at the end of the agreement to no lesser extent than in the case of judicial liquidation). In no case may the debt restructuring agreement provided under Articles 61 and 62 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency may impose new obligations, the granting of new over-draft facilities, 376 ----- and the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on third party creditors. Pursuant to Article 101 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to an approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in a subsequent judicial insolvency (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time it approves the plan or sanctions (omologazione) the agreement. Pursuant to the Articles 99 and 100 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the court, after the petition for a court-supervised pre-judicial insolvency composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) or for a debt restructuring agreement, may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur into new super-_ senior (so-called pre deducibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and certification by an expert that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem securities (garanzie reali), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the debtor until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financial indebtedness aims to achieve better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential to maintain the debtor’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 99 paragraph 3 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super-senior (so-called pre deducibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the debtor’s business. The debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify: (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds; and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor. Court-supervised pre-judicial insolvency composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, to compose its overall indebtedness or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency. Only the debtor can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato _preventivo (together with, inter alia, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing_ the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the debtor). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register. If the debtor has so requested in the application referred to in Article 40 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, from the date of its publication in the commercial register, creditors by reason of preceding title or cause cannot, under penalty of nullity, begin or continue executive and precautionary actions on the debtor’s assets. From the same date, the statute of limitations remains suspended and the forfeiture does not occur. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (including through non-recurring transactions, such as the granting of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (the so-called concordato in bianco), because the debtor, pursuant to Article 44 paragraph 1(a) of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, may ask the court to set a period between 30 and 60 days, which may be extended upon request of the debtor in the presence of justified reasons and in the absence of requests for the opening of judicial liquidation, by no more than 60 days, within which the debtor deposits the proposal for an arrangement with creditors with the plan, 377 ----- the attestation of truthfulness of the data and feasibility of the plan and the documentation referred to in Article 39, paragraph 1 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, or the agreements for the restructuring of debts. If the court accepts such petition, it appoints a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the debtor, who will report to the court any act of fraud committed against creditors (as described in Article 106 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), or any circumstance or conduct of the debtor which could jeopardize the effective solution of the crisis, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition for a concordato preventivo. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the necessary documentation also contains the periodical information requirements (relating to (i) the financial management of the debtor, (ii) the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application, and (iii) the restructuring plan) that the debtor has to fulfil, under the supervision of the judicial commissioner, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor will also file, on a monthly basis, a document relating to the debtor’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the companies’ register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the admission of the debtor into liquidation (liquidazione _giudiziale)._ Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the debtor may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to non-recurring activities to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the debtor during the insolvency procedures and new super-senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the validation (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement and court supervised pre-judicial insolvency composition with creditors, are treated as super-senior (so-called pre deducibili) and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempt from clawback pursuant to Article 166 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. The composition proposal may, in accordance with Article 87 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, provide for: (i) the debtor’s business to continue to be run by the debtor as a going concern; or for (ii) the business to be transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business be liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence continuing the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The independent experts must also certify that continuing the business is conducive to satisfying creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for partial or deferred payment of certain taxes pursuant to Article 88 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge to supervise the procedure (giudice delegato) and one or more judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali), and calls a creditors’ vote. While the proposal is implemented, the debtor generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who must authorize all transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business). The concordato preventivo is voted telematically and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote, and, (b) in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, the majority of such classes. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security or if the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only with respect to the part of their unsecured debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding one or more classes’ objection to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of dissenting 378 ----- creditors are adequately safeguarded compared to other solutions. If 20% of the creditors entitled to vote or, in case there are different classes of creditors, a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, file an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. Pursuant to the Article 90 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, it is possible for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least ten 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan in pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the debtor’s proposal does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) or (ii) 20% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) where the debtor has requested the opening of the alert procedure or has usefully initiated an assisted crisis resolution, in accordance with Article 24 of Business Crisis and Insolvency. In addition, to strengthen the position of unsecured creditors, the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency provides that a concordato liquidatorio (i.e., a pre-judicial insolvency agreement proposal aiming to transfer all assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid with respect to at least 20% of their claims and increase their satisfaction by at least 10% in comparison with the alternative judicial liquidation. To the extent the alternative plan is approved by creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, for instance by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 91 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency provides that if a plan in pre-judicial insolvency composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) includes an offer to sell the debtor’s assets or a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court opens a competitive bidding process to the extent it is in the best interest of the creditors. After approval by the creditors, the court, having settled any objections raised by dissenting creditors, confirms the _concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order._ If the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the delegated judge will immediately report to the court, which will, subsequently, open the judicial liquidation pursuant to Article 49 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency upon the request of one of the legitimated subjects (i.e. creditors or public prosecutor or the debtor itself) and provided that the necessary requirements exist. Pursuant to Article 97 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements, residential real estate preliminary sale agreements and real estate lease agreements), if they are not coherent with the plan’s prosecution or not functional to its execution. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable only once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. Judicial Liquidation Under the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the term “bankruptcy” (fallimento) has been replaced with the term “judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)”; however, its scope and objectives have not changed. A request to commence this proceeding to liquidate the debtor’s assets may be filed, in accordance with Article 37 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, by (i) the debtor itself, any of its creditors, (ii) the public prosecutor (in accordance with Article 38 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), or (iii) by the administrative bodies and authorities responsible for the control and supervision of the debtor. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court based on the COMI of the debtor. 379 ----- On the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings: (a) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interests and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and ranked pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale and sets forth the timing in its decision; (b) a receiver (curatore) is appointed to administer the debtor and manage its assets; (c) any act of the debtor done after a declaration of judicial insolvency (including payments made) is ineffective against the creditors; (d) continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the debtor, but only if continuation of the debtor’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and (e) the execution of certain contracts or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules under the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. Judicial liquidation proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. Liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. The applicable law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the debtor, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is granted under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, consequently, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor agreements would be recognized by an Italian judicial liquidation’s estate, to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). Composition with Creditors during the Judicial Liquidation A judicial insolvency proceeding can terminate prior to the decree giving effect to the liabilities account (stato passivo) effective through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, after the declaration of judicial insolvency. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year from such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effect to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Additionally, the debtor’s proposal is only admissible if it provides for the contribution of resources that increase the value of the assets by at least 10%. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their entire or part of their security, or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only with respect to the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. An abstention is considered as a favorable vote. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. 380 ----- Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle _grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ An extraordinary administration proceeding applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the Prodi-bis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. The extraordinary administration proceeding is divided into two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase”. Judicial Phase In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may make an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. Administrative Phase Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures. (either in the deed of guarantee or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit: in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee deed and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantors. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determinations. In order to comply with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code and corporate law requirements on, inter _alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that an Italian guarantor may be_ required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under the deed of guarantee will be subject to limitations. If and to the extent any Italian subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code is legally permitted to and does guarantee the Notes in the future, the relevant deed of guarantee may contain limitations on the relevant Italian guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable Italian law. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Consolidated Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively allowed to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Consolidated Banking Act may, inter alia, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015 issued by the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs and Finance (Ministero dell’Economia e delle _Finanze), implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Consolidated Banking Act, states that the_ issuance of guarantees by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling, controlled and associated companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above-described rules, subject to the Guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same groups, the provision of the guarantees would not qualify as a restricted financial activity. _Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Issues under Italian Law_ Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, the articles of association and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) or such company and is subject to, among the others, compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. Corporate Benefit An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the security interest or the guarantee being provided by such company (the so called “corporate benefit”). The concept of a “corporate benefit” is not specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis and its existence is purely a business judgment-based decision of the directors and the statutory auditors (if any) of the company. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at 383 ----- the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) by an Italian Company ultra vires and/or potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of an Italian company if it is assessed by a court, inter alia, that they did not act in the best interest of such company and that the granting of a security interest or a guarantee does not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or was against mandatory provisions of Italian law. Furthermore, criminal sanctions may apply to the directors of the company under Article 2634 of the Italian Civil Code, if violation of applicable Italian laws and regulations on financial assistance is found to have occurred. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the Italian grantor result in the imposition of or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/cross-stream/downstream security interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies. In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security interest or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) may be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an upstream or cross-stream security interest or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy depends on the existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such a guarantee or security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of a security interest or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit or advantage to it. In particular, in case of upstream and crossstream security interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of that group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by a guarantor or grantor of security must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In order to comply with corporate law requirements on corporate benefit, the amount of guarantees or security interests granted in respect of the obligations under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Guarantee Facility Agreement (collectively, the “Facilities Agreements”), the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, shall be subject to limitations. In particular, as regards each guarantor incorporated in the Republic of Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”), the obligations and liabilities such Italian Guarantor, in respect of the obligations and liabilities of any Obligor which is not a subsidiary (pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1, numbers 1 or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) of such Italian Guarantor, shall not exceed, at any time, an amount equal to the aggregate of: (a) the aggregate principal amount of the facilities at any time advanced to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1, numbers 1 or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) as borrower under the the above agreements; and (b) the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions, provided that with respect to IMA Bidco, such term shall include equity contributions in the form of capital 384 ----- contributions (versamenti in conto capitale o a fondo perduto) advanced to such Italian Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1, numbers 1 or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by any Obligor (whether directly or indirectly), and provided that, notwithstanding any provisions of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in relation to the obligations of any Obligor, Borrower or Guarantor, which is not a subsidiary (pursuant to Article 2359, paragraph 1, numbers 1 or 2, of the Italian Civil Code) of such Italian Guarantor, in respect of any amounts owed under any facility in excess of an amount equal to the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the guarantee given pursuant to the Transaction Documents (the “Set-Off Right”), it remaining understood that any provision establishing a deferral of Guarantors’ rights in any Transaction Documents, shall not prejudice, and will not apply to, the Set-Off Right. It is understood that, in respect of the obligations of any Obligor which is not a subsidiary of the relevant Italian Guarantor, the maximum amount that each Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture shall ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by that Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed creditor pursuant to the other Transaction Documents, and vice versa. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees shall be distributed amongst the guaranteed creditors (including, without, limitation, the noteholders) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor as guarantor under any Transaction Document (as defined therein) shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication. The same principle applies also to security providers incorporated in the Republic of Italy. Financial Assistance In addition, the granting of a guarantee or a security interest by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to provide financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security interest, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition, or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such Italian company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Financial assistance provided by an Italian company for the refinancing of indebtedness originally incurred for the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company may also be construed as a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security interest given or granted in breach of these provisions may be considered null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Certain Limitations on Enforcement_ Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws” above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: (a) the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; 385 ----- (b) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; (c) with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; (d) claims arising under Italian law-governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni and _decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to_ counterclaim; (e) pursuant to Article 1241 and following of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable; (f) where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; (g) the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles or in case mandatory rules of necessary application (norme di applicazione _necessaria);_ (h) there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; (i) enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ (j) the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; (k) any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); (l) an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; (m) an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; (n) in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; (o) the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a security interest extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; (p) in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable 386 ----- date (“data certa”); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; another way is to have each page of the document stamped by the post office; (q) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; (r) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; (s) penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; (t) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; (u) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor, other than the grantee of such security interest, from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant security interest; (v) in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee, but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares; and (w) the application of interests rates equal to or higher than rates set under Italian legislation on usury is not allowed; likewise, in certain specific circumstances, the interest capitalisation (namely “anatocismo”) is not allowed. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: (a) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and (b) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design. Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia: (a) the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee; (b) the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given; (c) the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or (d) the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors. If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest. 387 ----- _Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_ Trust and Security Agent Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes), which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee”, since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as agent or trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. In particular, even though trusts governed by foreign jurisdictions are recognized under Italian law, there are still doubts as to the validity of a trust when it does not comply with Italian law provisions governing rights in rem (diritti reali), security interests or when the trust is deemed to pursue a scope that does not deserve protection in light of the general principles of Italian law; to the Issuer’s knowledge, similar trust arrangements have never been tested in Italian courts and therefore there might be risks regarding the enforceability of the Notes Collateral insofar as it relates to such trust arrangements in the event that they are not upheld. Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes are not secured by the security interests created under such security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest. To address the above potential issue, the Notes Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Trustee and in favor of the Security Agent acting as agent with representative powers (con potere di _rappresentanza) of secured creditors and acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante)_ of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414_bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be created in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In this respect, the security interests will be created in favor of the Security Agent acting also as rappresentante of the holders of the Notes in accordance with Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code, who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available interpretation on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3 of the Italian civil code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the security documents nor are specifically identified therein (or, to the extent applicable, in the relevant share certificates, corporate documents or public registries). In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not a direct party to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security interests created under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante of the holders of the Notes cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Notes Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, we cannot exclude that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Notes Collateral is only granted in favor of the _rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security_ interest and/or cannot enforce that security interest. Undercapitalization Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In 388 ----- this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company, or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person, or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. There are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are incorporated as società per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Notes Collateral created over such intercompany loans or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. Mergers Following the Completion Date, we intend to consummate the Company Merger, should we acquire 100.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares in the context of the MTO (including the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out), or the Delisting Merger, should we not acquire 100.0% of the Outstanding Company Shares, in the context of the MTO (including the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out) and regardless of the number of Outstanding Company Shares that we will acquire; following completion of the Delisting Merger, we intend to complete the Debt Push Company Merger. See “Summary—The Transactions— _The Mergers”._ The Issuer (in the case of a Delisting Merger) or Sofima PIK (in the case of a Company Merger or a Debt Push Company Merger) will, following any Merger, enter into or reconfirm: (i) the share pledge in respect of the shares it owns in Company MergerCo (in case of the Company Merger), Delisting MergeCo (in case of Delisting Demerger) or Debt Push MergeCo (in case of Debt Push MergeCo); and (ii) an assignment of receivables by way of security in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to it by Company MergerCo, Delisting MergeCo or Debt Push MergeCo, as the case may be. Following the completion of any of the Delisting Merger and the Company Merger, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to refinance the financial indebtedness of the Target Group in full. We maintain that the Company Merger and the Debt Push Company Merger would qualify as mergerleveraged buy-out under Italian law, considering that the Issuer has incurred third-party indebtedness in order to, inter alia, finance the acquisition of the Company and, thus, they will be carried out pursuant to the provisions of Articles 2501-bis and ff. of the Italian Civil Code. In order to complete the Mergers, if any, there are various steps that we must take including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the board of directors of the companies involved in the Mergers (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the 389 ----- court for each of the companies involved in the Mergers, or by a common expert appointed by the court upon joint request of the companies, assessing, among the others, the methods used for determining the exchange ratio and the fairness of the ratio itself. In the case of the Company Merger and the Debt Push Company Merger, pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code: (i) the merger plan prepared under Article 2501-ter of the Italian Civil Code shall also contain the indication of the financial sources envisaged for the fulfillment of the obligations of the company resulting from the merger ; (ii) the report by the board of directors of the Company prepared under Article 2501-quinquies of the Italian Civil Code shall indicate the reasons of the transaction and contain an economic and financial plan indicating the source of the financial resources of the company and the description of the goals to be pursued; (iii) the report by the independent expert appointed by the court under Article 2501-sexies of the Italian Civil Code shall state the reasonableness of the assumptions of the above mentioned merger plan. As the incorporating company or the company resulting from any of the Mergers, if any, will be an Italian joint stock company (società per azioni), the independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Mergers can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the report of the independent expert will be released at the expected time and/or, with respect to the Company Merger and the Debt Push Company Merger, will state the reasonableness of the assumptions of the merger plan, or that the other steps required for the Mergers will be taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, the Mergers, if any, can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the Mergers. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the Mergers are entitled to challenge the Mergers. Upon the completion of the Company Merger or the Debt Push Company Merger, as applicable, the obligations of the Issuer in respect of, among others, the Notes will be automatically assumed by Company MergeCo and Debt Push MergeCo, respectively. General The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial decisions (including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex and time-consuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process, in comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. 390 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company is declared bankrupt. Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in _stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the _Marzano procedure. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided,_ the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt. The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. 381 ----- The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. Interim Financing The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, inter alia, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti) if: (i) an expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or_ (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status. Under Article 99 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the appeal must: (i) specify the use of the financing; (ii) state that the debtor is not able to find financing otherwise; and (iii) indicate the reasons why the absence of the financing would lead to a serious prejudice to the debtor’s activities or the continuation of the procedure. The appeal must be accompanied by a report from an independent professional certifying that all the requirements set forth in Article 99 are met, as well as that the financing should result in the better satisfaction of the creditors’ claims. The report is not necessary when the court finds that there is an urgent need to take steps to avoid serious and irreparable damage to the debtor’s business. 382 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

In particular, the following includes a brief description of certain aspects of bankruptcy, insolvency and certain other applicable regulations in the European Union and Italy. It is a summary only and does not include a full description of all regulations which may limit the validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the Guarantees and security interests. It should be noted that bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, schemes and/or events could be conducted or could occur in any of these jurisdictions, as well as in other jurisdictions. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantee and/or other security. In particular, under the EU regulations and regulations of EU member states, the insolvency (bankruptcy) proceedings may be initiated not only in the country where the entity is registered (incorporated) but also in other EU member states where the bankrupt entity conducts its business activity. Irrespective of the attempts to harmonize the bankruptcy regulations in EU Member States, the regulations in various states differ and the insolvency (bankruptcy) proceedings conducted in more than one state may create additional legal risks and costs for you.

Furthermore, according to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if the judgment rendered by the U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal to this end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above (including requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy). In original actions brought before Italian courts, there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions if the relevant application violates Italian public policy. 391 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Value in use is defined as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the continuing use of an asset. The present value of future cash flows is estimated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current estimated market cost of borrowing, which is calculated in relation to the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset.

When preparing consolidated financial statements, management must use accounting principles and methods which, in some cases, are based on difficult and subjective valuations and estimates, which are based on past experience, and on assumptions that are deemed from time to time as reasonable and realistic on a case-by-case basis. Application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts shown in the financial statements, namely the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, as well as the explanatory notes. The financial statement items that require a greater subjectivity on the part of the directors in preparing estimates and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions used can have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements are: - goodwill and other intangible assets, - deferred tax assets, - inventories, - revenue from contracts with customers, - contract assets and liabilities, - liabilities for employee benefits, - liabilities calculated as the current value of the exercise price of purchase options on minority interests, - bad debt provisions, - identification of a lease contract, estimate of its duration in the presence of options for renewal or early termination, estimate of the components of a liability by lease and the related discount rate, - provisions for risks and charges. With reference to goodwill and other intangible assets, in relation to both the allocation of the price of business combinations and the impairment test, the processes and methods for evaluating and determining estimates are based on complex assumptions regarding revenue, operating costs, margins, investments, terminal value growth rates and discount rates, to differentiate for each CGU on the basis of the different markets in which the Group operates. As regards revenue from contracts with customers for contract work and contract assets and liabilities, application of the cost-to-cost method requires a prior estimate of the entire lifetime costs of individual projects, updating them at each balance sheet date. This requires assumptions to be made by the directors. These assumptions can be affected by multiple factors, such as the time span of several years over which some projects are developed, their high level of technology and innovative content, the possible presence of price variations and revisions, and machinery performance guarantees, including an estimate of contractual risks, where applicable. These facts and circumstances make it difficult to estimate the projects’ costs to complete and, consequently, to estimate the value of contract work in progress at the balance sheet date.

The Group continued the analysis started in 2016 of the potential impact that adoption of the new standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and IFRS 16 Leases could have on the balance sheet, financial position, income statement and information contained in the Group’s financial statements and notes. IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and introduced a new model for the recognition of revenue deriving from contracts with customers on the basis of the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract with the customer; (ii) identification of performance obligations to be transferred to the customer in exchange for the consideration (iii) identification of the contractual consideration (iv) allocation of the consideration to the individual performance obligations; (v) recognition of revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. IFRS 15 provides for the recognition of revenue for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity believes to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to the customer. The new standard will replace all current requirements found in IFRS regarding the recognition of revenue and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group will apply the new standard from the obligatory effective date, using the simplified method of application. In 2016 and 2017, the Group carried out an assessment of the effects of IFRS 15. This analysis considered the clarifications issued by the IASB in April 2016. As part of the preliminary assessment of the accounting impact of adopting the new standards, we have identified the main revenue streams by analysing IMA S.p.A. and the subsidiaries of the Group: - machines and contracts in progress; - change parts; - spare parts and other materials; - technical assistance.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,2486,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A) OVERVIEW,2486.1,,2486.1.1,,"The periodic financial Information at 30 September 2020 was approved by the Board of Directors on 10 November 2020. IMA Group is a world leader in the design and production of automatic machines for the processing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tea, coffee, tobacco and other food products. The interim results from the market segment in which IMA Group operates are generally not fully representative of those expected for the year as a whole, as sales tend to be concentrated towards the end of the year, which also applies to rival companies operating in the same segment. The Parent Company of the IMA Group is I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche S.p.A. (referred to as “IMA”, “IMA S.p.A.” or the “Parent Company”), with registered offices at Via Emilia 428/442, Ozzano dell’Emilia (Bologna). IMA is listed on the electronic stock exchange of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. in the STAR segment. At 30 September 2020 SO.FI.M.A. Società Finanziaria Macchine Automatiche S.p.A. (“SOFIMA”) holds 22,295,194 shares of IMA, equal to 51.594% of the share capital and 66.956% of the voting rights: In fact, IMA S.p.A. uses the system of shares with increased voting rights pursuant to art. 127-quinquies of the CFA, as commented on in Note 11. On 28 July 2020, the Board of Directors of IMA S.p.A. announced that it had been informed by the shareholders of the parent company SOFIMA, that they had reached an agreement relating to the sale of approximately 20% of their shares in SOFIMA to funds assisted by BC Partners LLP (“BC Partners”), an international leader in the sector. For further information please refer to the comments on the results for the period, in the section entitled Other information. IMA S.p.A. has dealings mainly of a commercial nature with the Group’s manufacturing companies, involving the purchase and sale of machines required for the assembly of complete product lines. It also provides these companies with services. IMA’s dealings with the Group’s marketing companies relate to the sale, distribution and related customer service activities in their respective territories of products manufactured by IMA’s various divisions. IMA’s manufacturing subsidiaries also have similar relationships with these marketing companies. During preparation of the Periodic Financial Information, impairment tests are carried out on the carrying amounts of goodwill if there are indicators of impairment. Since the Covid-19 pandemic constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of impairment (i.e. an impairment indicator), despite the Group reporting positive results at 30 September 2020 and its market capitalization is well above shareholders’ equity, the validity of the data used and the scenarios developed was verified during the impairment test for the Financial Report at 31 December 2019. As explained in the section on the “Outlook for the rest of the year”, the order trend in the reference sectors in the second and third quarter of the year was positive, despite the situation caused by the Covid-19 emergency, once again highlighting the resilience of the reference sectors in which the Group operates. For further information, please refer to the section on Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Periodic Financial Information and on the use of estimates and assumptions and to Note 3. IMA Group is a world leader in the design and production of automatic machines for the processing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tea, coffee, tobacco and other food products. The Parent Company of the IMA Group is I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche S.p.A. (IMA, IMA S.p.A. or the “Parent Company”), with registered offices at Via Emilia 428/442, Ozzano dell’Emilia (Bologna), and is listed on the electronic stock exchange of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. in the “S.T.A.R.” segment. At 31 December 2019, IMA S.p.A. was held 51.594% by SO.FI.M.A. Società Finanziaria Macchine Automatiche S.p.A. (56.789% at 31 December 2018), with registered offices at Via Farini 11, Bologna (hereinafter SO.FI.M.A.). Following the total asymmetric spin-off of Lopam Fin S.p.A., the former parent company of SO.FI.M.A., which took place on 16 July 2019, and its consequent cancellation from the companies register, the entity at the highest hierarchical level that holds control of IMA S.p.A. at 31 December 2019 is SO.FI.M.A., which draws up the consolidated financial statements including the largest group of companies belonging to the Group. These consolidated financial statements are available at the Bologna Companies Register.

In addition, there is a pledge on the shares of ATOP S.p.A. against a loan of 12.5 million euros. At 30 September 2020 the Group had around 724 million euros of unutilised borrowing facilities (around 550 million euros at 31 December 2019). Following the same prudential approach with a view to “liquidity risk management”, IMA also decided to increase its overall availability of credit lines through “Revolving Credit Facilities committed”, which are being defined with the banking system for a total of around 300 million euros with a duration of between 12 and 18 months. This will make it possible to meet any financial needs should the current emergency situation last for a long time. _PAYABLES TO OTHER LENDERS_ The item includes current payables to factoring companies for 0.3 million euros (1.1 million euros at 31 December 2019) and payables to others for 0.2 million euros (0.2 million euros at 31 December 2019 ). _BONDS_ In June 2019, the Parent Company finalised the placement with European institutional investors (through a so-called “Euro private placement”) of a senior bond loan, non-guaranteed and non-convertible, for 50 million euros. The bond loan and a medium-long term cash loan of 180.0 million euros granted by leading credit institutions in July 2019 are designed to finance the acquisition of ATOP. The bonds are unrated, with a duration of 7 years and are admitted to trading on the Third Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange. The capital will be repaid at par at the scheduled due date, though early redemption is possible. The bonds bear interest from the issue date at a fixed rate of 1.923% per annum. In May 2014, the Parent Company completed the placement with European institutional investors of a non-convertible bond amounting to 80 million euros, represented by two separate issues of equal F-46 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

These balances and transactions relate primarily to the Group’s Italian companies. There are also dealings with SOFIMA, the Parent Company, as a result of setting up the domestic tax group, as mentioned in Note 21. The increase in trade payables to associates reflects the Group’s constant commitment in pursuing close collaboration with those suppliers that play a key role in production, also by considering the possibility of becoming shareholders in their companies. Transactions with associates are largely of a commercial nature. See Note 4 for further information. The total cost incurred in the first nine months of 2020 for the remuneration due to executives with strategic responsibilities is approximately 3.0 million euros (5.9 million euros in the same period of 2019).

Please refer to the section “Scope of consolidation” for detailed comments on the absorption of GIMA TT S.p.A. by IMA S.p.A. (“Merger”), communicated to the market on 11 June 2019 and approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings of the two companies on 8 August 2019. The merger took effect on 5 November 2019, once the merger deed had been signed and registered with the Bologna Companies Register on 31 October 2019. In relation to the Merger, the following is worth noting: - as regards IMA S.p.A., the merger is exempt from the company procedure that regulates transactions with related parties, as it was a transaction carried out with a subsidiary in which there were no significant interests of other related parties; - as regards GIMA TT S.p.A., the merger was considered a transaction with related parties that was not exempt from the company procedure, as it was concluded with the controlling shareholder. Moreover, from a size point of view, this operation was considered to be of “greater significance”. Consequently, the merger project was approved by the Board of Directors of GIMA TT S.p.A. subject to the reasoned favourable opinion of the committee consisting solely of unrelated independent directors of GIMA TT S.p.A. regarding the company’s interest in completing the transaction, as well as the convenience and substantial and procedural correctness of the terms and conditions of the merger of GIMA TT S.p.A. and IMA S.p.A., which was unanimously given on 10 June 2019.

A review of interim condensed consolidated financial statements_ consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

First-time adoption (FTA) of IFRS 16 had no effect on the calculation of the financial parameters foreseen in existing covenants. In the 2019 income statement, the FTA of IFRS 16 led to the elimination of operating lease payments for 23,170 thousand euros and the recognition of depreciation of the right of use assets and interest expense on the lease liabilities of 21,024 thousand euros and 4,208 thousand euros, respectively. The Group has applied IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments from 1 January 2019. The interpretation clarifies how to apply the requirements relating to the recognition and measurement referred to in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty about the treatments for income tax purposes and, in particular, about any tax treatments adopted which may not be accepted by the tax authorities. Following adoption of the interpretation, the Group looked to see if there were any uncertain tax positions and came to the conclusion that they would not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements. The other amendments and interpretations of accounting standards and methods in force from 1 January 2019 govern circumstances and situations that are not present or relevant to the Group’s consolidated financial statements: - Amendments to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures; - Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation; - Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement; - Annual cycle of improvements to IFRS 2015-2017 – includes some amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

The objective of interest rate risk management is to contain and stabilize the outflow of interest payments on mainly medium-term debt so as to achieve close correlation between the underlying and the hedging instrument. Hedging, which is decided on a case-by-case basis, is arranged using derivative contracts, typically purchases of IRS and caps and sales of floors which, once a certain level has been reached, transform a floating rate into a fixed rate.

In addition, there is a pledge on the shares representing the capital of ATOP S.p.A. against a loan of 16,000 thousand euros. Lastly, it is worth pointing out that a loan obtained by the Parent Company in 2014 from the European Investment Bank (EIB), at 31 December 2019 is secured by a SACE guarantee of 1,400 thousand euros. Certain loans and financings are guaranteed by compliance with certain financial covenants calculated on the basis of the following items in the consolidated financial statements: - ratio between net financial charges and EBITDA; - ratio of net financial indebtedness to equity; - ratio between net debt and EBITDA; - ratio between gross debt and EBITDA. Non-compliance with these covenants would constitute a material event for the purposes of calling in the related loans. At 31 December 2019, all covenant requirements have been met. Interest rates on financial payables are on average less than 5% (less than 5% in 2018). At 31 December 2019 the Group had around 550 million euros of unutilised borrowing facilities (around 462 million euros at 31 December 2018). The book value of advances on export transactions reflects a good estimate of their fair value. Determining the fair value of mortgages and other loans as the present value of future capital and interest flows, calculated using the market rate expressed by the zero coupon free risk curve as of the reporting date, would lead to an increase in payables by around 19 million euros.

The cost of the acquisition includes the 10,000 thousand euros paid at the closing, the balance of the provisional price of 2,351 thousand euros paid in July 2019 and the potential consideration of 9,252 thousand euros, of which 3,357 thousand euros by way of earn-out and 5,895 thousand euros for the fair value of the option for the purchase of the other 30% of Spreafico Automation S.r.l., discounted using the return on government securities with the same maturity. At 31 December 2019 the newly acquired companies, which were consolidated for 9 months, generated revenue of 12,278 thousand euros and an operating profit of 2,778 thousand euros, including personnel costs of 1,951 thousand euros. On 19 June 2019 IMA acquired a further 50% of CMRE S.r.l., a real estate company based in Bologna, from related parties for 5,000 thousand euros, thus bringing its total stake in the company to 100%. As required by IFRS 3, if a business combination is carried out in stages, the previously held interest is remeasured at fair value at the date control is acquired and the difference between it and the value of the previously held investment is recognized in the income statement; the charge relating to the acquisition of CMRE S.r.l., calculated in this way, was equal to 956 thousand euros. The goodwill recognized provisionally amounts to approximately 871 thousand euros. On 2 July 2019, IMA completed the closing for the purchase of 56.1% of ATOPbi S.p.A. and 16% of Stator S.p.A.. Following this agreement, IMA, which was already a shareholder of ATOPbi S.p.A. since 2017, achieved an overall interest in the company of 81.1% and indirectly holds 84% of ATOP S.p.A., a company based in Barberino Tavarnelle (FI) and a market leader in automatic machines and lines for the production of stators and rotors used in electric motors for the automotive sector. Subsequently, in December 2019, as a consequence of the absorption of Stator S.p.A. by ATOP S.p.A. and the reverse merger of ATOPbi S.p.A. with ATOP S.p.A., effective from 1 January 2019, at the reporting date, IMA came to hold directly 84.165% of ATOP S.p.A.; Put & call options were also taken out on the shares reinvested by the founding shareholders for a total of 6.8% of the capital, to be exercised after the date of approval of the financial statements at 31 December 2021.

In the recognition of the goodwill generated by the acquisition, minority interests were not recognised as permitted by IFRS 3. The cost of the acquisition includes the amount of 225,887 thousand euros paid at the closing and the consideration of 24,685 thousand euros relating to the fair value of the option subscribed for the purchase of 8.12% of ATOPbi S.p.A., discounted using the yield on government securities with the same duration. It should also be noted that in the Financial information at 30 September 2019 the excess of the purchase cost compared with the fair value of the business combination was determined on a non-definitive basis and provisionally allocated to goodwill.

Furthermore, it subscribed a capital reserve of 300 thousand euros. The interest that Spares & More S.r.l. has in Claren Cutting Service S.r.l. is therefore 100%.

The objective of interest rate risk management is to contain and stabilize the outflow of interest payments on mainly medium-term debt so as to achieve close correlation between the underlying and the hedging instrument. Hedging, which is decided on a case-by-case basis, is arranged using derivative contracts, typically the purchase of IRS and caps and the sale of floors which, at a certain level, transform the floating rate into a fixed rate.

On 4 May 2018, IMA completed the closing for the purchase of 82.5% of TMC S.p.A, based in Castel Guelfo (Bologna), which produces and markets automatic machines for packaging and management of Tissue and Personal Care products and related after-sales services. TMC, which was founded in 1997, has over time consolidated its international leadership in a number of market niches such as primary and secondary packaging of kitchen rolls and toilet rolls, secondary packaging of personal care products such as nappies for babies, incontinence products for adults and for hygiene products for women. IMA has signed put and call options for the other 17.5%, to be exercised by April 2023. The terms and conditions of the put & call options already give the Group access to the economic benefits related to the portion of capital optioned; the Group therefore accounts for this portion as if it had already been purchased.

The changes in the breakdown of revenue by geographical area are discussed below: - revenue from European Union countries, excluding Italy, is growing in Germany, United Kingdom, Romania, Poland, and Spain; - sales in other European countries are increasing compared with the previous year, especially in Russia and Switzerland; - North America is growing significantly in a context essentially without significant local competition; - Asia & Middle East grew by 6% overall, confirming the importance of this market that always generates more than 20% of the Group’s sales, confirming past trends. The progress in local economies is generating an improvement in production standards closer to those of the West and as a consequence a demand for machinery more in line with what we can offer. In particular, there has been growth in Turkey, Indonesia and Vietnam; - revenue from other countries reflects a variety of trends with growth in Algeria, Argentina, Colombia and South Africa; - the fall in Italy was solely due to the lower number of projects with respect to the prior year. These fluctuations recur annually since revenue depends on the level of investment projects of the pharmaceutical companies, which is inevitably unstable in a small market like Italy.

The other increases principally relate to the purchase of plant, machinery and electronic machines. Disposals during the year included the sale by Ilapak Ltd. of the building in Hayes (UK). This transaction generated a gain of 969 thousand GB pounds sterling.

The reduction in the value of the Medtech CGU goodwill of 1,710 thousand euros refers to the definition of the consideration paid as earn-out and which took place during the valuation period of 12 months as established by IFRS 3. As mentioned in the section on “Accounting Policies”, goodwill, which is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, is tested for impairment. The main assumptions, methods and parameters used in impairment testing are set out below. The goodwill paid when acquiring companies, firms or business divisions is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) of the Group as represented by the individual companies or sub-groups to which they relate. Even if such companies had merged into the acquiring company after the acquisition and had thus lost their legal status, the Group organization into divisions makes it possible to identify the assets and the cash flows of said CGUs, and to check whether allocated goodwill is recoverable through the impairment test. The recoverable value of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated is tested by determining their value in use, as represented by the present value of expected cash flows discounted using a rate that reflects the risks specific to each CGU at the measurement date.

The assumptions used in calculating the impairment included in the business plan of each CGU and the results achieved have been approved by the Board of Directors of IMA S.p.A., independently and prior to these financial statements. The impairment tests of goodwill conducted in accordance with IAS 36 did not lead to any writedowns. In addition, during prior years, the amounts of goodwill of the Nova Group, Zanchetta and ICO OLEODINAMICI CGUs were written down by 757 thousand euros, 2,500 thousand euros and 1,500 thousand euros, respectively. Assets under development and advances mainly relate to the capitalization of development costs incurred by the Parent Company (6,424 thousand euros), IMA Automation USA Inc. (1,435 thousand euros) and GIMA TT S.p.A. (1,850 thousand euros) and concern new products that were not previously available and are targeted at new market segments. The item write-downs/impairment mainly refers to two projects attributable to the Parent Company for 1,040 thousand euros and to Ilapak Italia SpA for 1,802 thousand euros, offset by the sinking-fund grant of 927 thousand euros. Other construction in progress has been checked and no further adjustments have emerged. F-299 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Certain loans and financings are guaranteed by compliance with certain financial covenants calculated on the basis of the following items in the consolidated financial statements: - ratio between net financial charges and EBITDA; - ratio of net financial indebtedness to equity; - ratio between net debt and EBITDA; - ratio between gross debt and EBITDA. Non-compliance with these covenants would constitute a material event for the purposes of calling in the related loans. At 31 December 2017, all covenant requirements have been met. Interest rates on financial payables are on average less than 5% (less than 5% in 2016). At 31 December 2017 the Group had around 363 million euros of unutilised borrowing facilities (around 374 million euros at 31 December 2016). The book value of advances on export transactions reflects a good estimate of their fair value. Determining the fair value of mortgages and other loans as the present value of future capital and interest flows, calculated using the market rate expressed by the zero coupon free risk curve as of the reporting date, would lead to an increase in payables by around 7.8 million euros.

As required by IFRS 3, any adjustments will be made within twelve months of the acquisition date. The amounts of goodwill recognized as part of the purchase price allocation process were subject to an impairment test without there being any need for adjustments. 1,698 thousand euros of ancillary charges related to the acquisition were booked to the income statement under services, rentals and leases.

The liquidity that the plan is able to generate depends on fluctuations in the interest rates on the individual securities held.

Other provisions are made up essentially of provisions for risks and charges made to cover tax liabilities (Note 27) or charges that might arise from contractual obligations; Group companies used experienced tax consultants to quantify the provisions. During the first half of 2010, the Parent Company was subjected to a tax audit by the Tax Authorities that ended in June 2010. Following the audit, notices of assessment were issued that IMA SpA has appealed against to the competent tax authorities. With reference to these disputes, in October 2017 the Parent Company submitted to the Tax Authorities an Application for the Facilitated Definition of Tax Disputes Pending pursuant to Art. 11 of Legislative Decree 24 April 2017, converted, with amendments, by Law 96 of 21 June 2017, at the same time paying the total amount of 401 thousand euros, which was already accrued in Other provisions, and filed requests for suspension of the related proceedings with the competent authorities.

Although the Group has defined the six-month period as an interim period of reference for the purpose of applying IAS 34 and the definition of interim financial statements indicated in it, the periodic financial information at 30 September 2020 has been prepared in compliance with this standard, in anticipation of its possible inclusion in the documentation to be prepared in the event of extraordinary transactions. The accounting principles used, the recognition and measurement criteria, as well as the consolidation criteria and methods applied to the periodic financial information at 30 September 2020 are in compliance with those applied when preparing the 2019 annual report, to which reference should be made for their broader discussion. As an issuer trading on the STAR segment of the MTA market run by Borsa Italiana, IMA is subject to the aforementioned art. 2.2.3 of the Stock Exchange Regulations. As announced on 20 January 2017, the Parent Company will continue to publish quarterly reports within 45 days from the end of the first and third quarter of the year. _FINANCIAL STATEMENTS_ The statement of financial position has been classified on the basis of the operating cycle, distinguishing between current and non-current components. Costs and revenues for the period are presented in two schedules: a consolidated income statement, which analyses costs according to their nature and a consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The income statement figures for the periodic financial information at 30 September 2020 are compared with those at 30 September 2019, as approved by the Board of Directors on 14 November 2019 and available on the website www.ima.it, to which reference should be made for more details. Changes in equity are indicated in the relative statement, which also includes those that took place in the first nine months of 2019. The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method for determining cash flow from operating activities. The Group classifies interest and dividends as cash flows from financing activities. Unless stated otherwise, the figures in the periodic financial information at 30 September 2020 are expressed in millions of euros. _CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES_ The periodic financial information has been prepared using the consolidation principles adopted for preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019, as they are compatible. **C) ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED FROM 1 JANUARY 2020** The accounting policies used to prepare the periodic financial information at 30 September 2020 are consistent with those used to prepare the financial statements at 31 December 2019, to which the reader is referred for further information. The other amendments and interpretations of accounting standards and methods in force from 1 January 2020 govern circumstances and situations that are not F-27 ----- present, not relevant or that have not had material effects on the Group’s consolidated financial statements: - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards; - Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business; - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material; - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform; - Amendments to IFRS 16 – Leases: Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions (effective date 1 June 2020). - inventories; - revenue from contracts with customers; - contract assets and liabilities; - liabilities for employee benefits; - liabilities calculated as the current value of the exercise price of purchase options on minority interests; - bad debt provisions; - identification of a lease contract, estimate of its duration in the presence of options for renewal or early termination, estimate of the components of a lease liability and the related discount rate; - provisions for risks and charges. It should also be noted that certain valuation processes, particularly the more complex ones such as assessing whether there is impairment of non-current assets, are generally carried out in full only when preparing the annual financial statements, when all of the information needed is available, except in cases where there are clear signs of impairment that require an immediate assessment of any loss in value. Since the Covid-19 pandemic constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of impairment (i.e. an impairment indicator), the sustainability of the impairment tests described in Note 3 was assessed. The result for the period is stated net of taxes calculated using the best estimate of the weighted average tax rate expected for the full year. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of any changes are recognized immediately in the period when circumstances change. During the first nine months, there were no significant effects deriving from the revision of estimates made in previous financial statements. - Liquidity risk related to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market; - Market risk, specifically: a) Exchange rate risk, relating to operations in areas using currencies other than the functional currency; b) Interest rate risk, relating to the Group’s exposure to interest-bearing financial instruments; c) Price risk, associated with changes in the listed price of capital instruments held as financial assets and in commodity prices. This periodic financial information does not include all of the disclosures on financial risk management that are required in annual financial statements. It should therefore be read together with the annual report at 31 December 2019, as the Covid-19 pandemic has not changed these risks significantly. There have been no substantial changes in financial risk management nor in the policies adopted by the Group during the period, with the exception of the “Revolving Credit Facilities” indicated in Note 13.

The sale price, equal to 3.1 million euros, was paid in full at the closing and measurement of the recoverable value of the asset led to the recognition of an impairment loss of 1.5 million euros; - on 14 September 2020, the plan for IMA S.p.A. to absorb its wholly-owned subsidiary Corazza S.p.A. was filed with the Bologna Companies Register. The merger will take place in a simplified form, so without an exchange of shares, without the merging company increasing its capital and without any amendment to its articles of association. The merger will help simplify the IMA Group’s corporate structure and optimise management of the related cash flows. The merger resolutions were approved by the Board of Directors of IMA S.p.A. and by the Shareholders’ Meeting of Corazza S.p.A. and filed with the Companies Register on 20 October 2020.

The activity in this sector is carried out by the Parent Company’s IMA T&T Division. From 2020, the BFB (end-of-line machines) Division, previously part of the Tea, Food & Other sector, has been allocated to the Pharmaceutical sector. The comparative figures have been consistently restated. The information on operating segments for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 is provided below: Tea, Food & Other segment revenue has increased compared with the previous year with a contribution of 1.9 million euros by the Record business and thanks to the lines for surgical masks made for the Civil Defence, which were all delivered during the third quarter of the current year. Operating profit has decreased by 2.1 million euros because of higher amortisation and depreciation following the acquisition of ATOP and the allocation of consolidation differences. Revenue in the Pharmaceutical segment is down compared with the same period of the previous year (-38.6 million euros) and reflects a lower intake of orders compared with the previous year. Operating profit is substantially in line at 56.9 million euros compared with 55.7 million euros in the same period of 2019. Revenue in the Tobacco sector amounts to 61.2 million euros, an increase on the previous year (54.3 million euros) because of a different distribution of deliveries compared with the previous period, despite the lower backlog at the beginning of the year and fewer new orders acquired in the sector for new generation products. Operating profit increased by 4.2 million euros. Total assets at 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 are as follows: Pharmaceutical Tobacco packaging Notallocated (*) Total in millions of euros Tea, Food & Other Total assets at 30 September 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,351.8 679.8 73.0 297.0 2,401.6 Total assets at 31 December 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,332.9 652.1 59.5 256.5 2,301.0 _(*)_ _Not allocated assets principally comprise investments, cash and financial assets, income tax receivable and deferred tax assets not directly attributable to the operating segments._ Following the adoption of IFRS 15, the Group has broken down the revenue from contracts with customers into categories that illustrate how economic factors affect the nature, amount, timing and degree of uncertainty of revenue and financial flows. Both the information provided in the presentations to investors and the information periodically reviewed by the highest operational decision-making level were considered and therefore the breakdown of revenue subsequently presented in three categories was considered appropriate: geographical area, business segment and timing of recognition. _REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA_ The change in the scope of consolidation relates to Record S.p.A. “Other assets” comprise: in millions of euros 30.09.2020 31.12.2019 Electronic office equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.4 8.4 Office furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.1 3.0 Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.4 1.6 Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.2 0.7 Year of acquisition 30.09.2020 31.12.2019 ATOP S.p.A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2019 39.4 42.9 Spreafico Automation S.r.l. . . . . . . . . . . 2019 15.6 17.0 Perfect Pack S.r.l. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2019 4.4 4.8 Tecmar S.A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2019 1.8 1.9 Ciemme S.r.l. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2018 3.7 4.1 TMC Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2018 19.7 21.6 Petroncini Impianti S.p.A. . . . . . . . . . . . 2018 5.8 6.4 Eurosicma S.p.A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2017 13.4 14.7 Benhil GmbH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2015 5.8 6.9 Ilapak Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2013 4.8 6.0 Development costs include the costs incurred for unpatented technology, the useful life of which has been estimated to be between 5 and 13 years and is attributable to the following acquisitions: In addition, this caption includes costs of 8.5 million euros incurred by the Parent Company on projects related to the Pharmaceutical sector, 10.6 million euros on project development for the Tea, Food & Other sector and 7.0 million euros on projects relating to the Tobacco sector.

As already mentioned in the chapter on the “Outlook for the rest of the year”, the trend of orders in the reference sectors in the second and third quarter of the year was positive despite the situation linked to the Covid-19 emergency, highlighting once again the resilience of the sectors in which the Group operates. The consistency of the backlog and the number of projects under negotiation, even of significant amounts, is a positive sign that not only has the Group not received order cancellations, but customers continue to plan investments despite the current situation of health emergency that characterizes not only Italy but the whole world. No impairment indicators emerged from this analysis. In addition, during prior years, the amounts of goodwill of the Nova Group (Safe CGU), Zanchetta and ICO Oleodinamici (Active CGU) were written down by 0.8 million euros, 2.5 million euros and 1.5 million euros, respectively. Assets under development and advances mainly relate to the capitalization of development costs in progress and new technologies incurred by the Parent Company (27.3 million euros), Tissue Machinery Company S.p.A. (2.4 million euros) and ATOP S.p.A. (1.9 million euros). Assets under development have been tested for impairment, but no signs of impairment emerged.

Net financial indebtedness at the end of the period amounts to 700.9 million euros compared with 637.1 million euros at 31 December 2019. The increase is mainly due to the physiological growth in net working capital. Net debt is expected to decline significantly towards the end of the year. This is a normal process due to the seasonal nature of the business, with 30 September falling into a period of the year when working capital always rises because of work on contracts that will be delivered later in the year. _PAYABLES IN RESPECT OF ACQUISITIONS_ At 30 September 2020 these include payables for the purchase of investments relating to the acquisitions that took place in 2019 for 52.9 million euros, mainly relating to ATOP S.p.A., Perfect Pack S.r.l., Spreafico Automation S.r.l. and Tecmar S.A., the acquisitions that took place in 2018 for 26.0 million euros, which mainly relate to Ciemme S.r.l. and TMC Group, and the acquisitions that took place in previous years for 19.3 million euros, which mainly relate to Eurosicma S.p.A. and Teknoweb Converting S.r.l.

Milan Milan - Italy have to prepare annual reports according to the same single electronic communication format known as the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), using the XHTML computer language integrated by appropriate markings in XBRL. The Group is assessing what has to be done to comply with the new methods on schedule, also monitoring any further developments during the year. _Financial statements_ The statement of financial position has been classified on the basis of the operating cycle, distinguishing between current and non-current items. With this distinction, assets and liabilities are considered current if they are expected to be realized or settled as part of the Group’s normal operating cycle or within twelve months. Non-current assets held for sale and related liabilities, if any, are shown in the appropriate items. Costs and revenue for the year are presented in two statements: a consolidated income statement, which analyses costs according to their nature, and a consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The result deriving from discontinued assets and/or disposal groups, if any, is shown under an appropriate item of the consolidated income statement. The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method for determining cash flow from operating activities. Under this method, the net profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of non-monetary transactions, any deferral of operational collections and payments already made, any accrued cash movements and the revenue or cost elements deriving from cash flows attributable to investment or financing activities. The Group classifies interest and dividends as cash flows from financing activities. The figures contained in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2019 are expressed in thousands of euros, except where otherwise indicated. When accounting for the sale of property, plant and equipment, the date on which the buyer obtains control of the asset is considered the disposal date, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 to determine when a performance obligation is satisfied. Furthermore, the amount of the consideration included in the profit or loss deriving from derecognition of these assets is determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 for determining the transaction price. The Group did not apply this accounting method to the leases involving intangible assets, to short-term leases of property, plant and equipment and leases involving low-value assets. Low-value contracts refer mainly to electronic devices. Impairment tests are carried out when factors internal or external to the company suggest that the value of an asset may have been impaired. In the case of goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the impairment test must be carried out at least once a year. If the conditions that led to an impairment cease to apply, the proportional reinstatement of the value of assets previously written down must not exceed the depreciated historical cost that would have been reported had such earlier impairment not been recognized. Writebacks are recognized in the income statement. International accounting standards prohibit the reversal of impairment losses recognized in relation to goodwill. _Investments in equity instruments_ At the time of initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably choose to classify its equity investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments pursuant to IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. Classification is determined for each individual instrument. Profits and losses achieved on these financial assets are never transferred to the income statement. Dividends are recognized as financial income in the income statement when the right to payment has been authorised, except when the Group benefits from these proceeds as recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case these profits are recognized in OCI. Equity instruments recognized at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment testing. _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss_ This category includes assets held for trading, assets designated at the time of initial recognition as financial assets at fair value with changes recognized in the income statement, or financial assets that must necessarily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all those assets acquired for sale or repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including those that are carved out, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not represented solely by principal and interest payments are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, regardless of the business model. Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value are recognised in profit/(loss) for the year. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined by their market value at the date of designation when it refers to hedging instruments of future cash flows. This is recognized in the fair value reserve in equity and reversed to income when the event associated with the underlying financial expense/ income occurs. Changes in the fair value of instruments that do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement as financial income/expense. date, a provision must be recognized that reflects the 12-month ECL: the expected losses are estimated on the basis of possible default events in the following 12 months, with a reduced impact of the calculation on the ECLs. In fact, for this category of instruments, the standard makes it possible to reduce the coefficients, as the parameters are not estimated over a time horizon that reflects the entire residual life of the instrument, permitting a saving in terms of the amount to be accrued to the bad debt provision; - Stage 2 and 3 – on the other hand, for assets that have undergone a significant increase in credit risk, the entity has to recognize a provision equal to the expected losses over the entire residual life of these financial assets, taking into account the probability of default that could occur over the entire life of the instrument (“Lifetime ECL”). When defining the methodological approach to be applied to the assets in the scope of impairment, the financial assets in the portfolio subject to impairment were analysed with particular reference to trade receivables and contract assets, which represent the majority of the Group’s credit exposure. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group generally determines qualitative and quantitative thresholds to define the default of these positions which are valued using the IFRS 9 simplified approach (ECL = EAD x PD x LGD). For positions that do not exceed these qualitative and quantitative thresholds, the Group assesses the ECL by dividing these credits into specific clusters, also taking into account the geographical area, the product area and the credit rating, applying the impairment model based on expected losses through the operational exemplification of the provision matrix. For trade receivables deemed individually significant by management and for which more detailed information on the significant increase in credit risk is available, a simplified approach has been applied within the simplified model. Impairment losses determined in accordance with IFRS 9 are presented separately in the income statement if the amount is considered significant. For further information on receivables and contract assets, please refer to the comments in the section on Revenue from contracts with customers. As a result of the reform of the supplementary pension scheme, introduced by Law 296 of 27 December 2006 (the Finance Act 2007), the Group calculates the actuarial value of severance pay accrued before 2007 without making allowance for any future wage increases. The portion accrued after 31 December 2006 is treated as a defined-contribution plan. The net liabilities of the Group in relation to the defined-benefit plans are determined separately for each plan, estimating the present value of the future benefits earned by employees during the current and prior years, and deducting the fair value of any assets held to service the plan. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in a specific equity reserve. The cost of each plan is determined with reference to demographic and statistical assumptions and on the basis of wage trends. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that taxable income in future years will be sufficient to realize them. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off-set only when there is a legal entitlement to do so and when they relate to taxes due to the same tax authority. Provision for taxes that might arise on transferring undistributed earnings of subsidiaries are only made if there is a real intention to transfer such earnings. Taxes relating to prior periods include revenue and expenses recognized during the year for income tax relating to prior years. or completes the service and the moment when it receives payment is not expected to exceed 12 months. Presentation in the financial statements is as follows: - Contract assets: the right to a consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the transaction is fulfilled before payment of the consideration or before the payment is due, the contract is presented as an asset deriving from a contract, excluding the amounts presented as receivables. At each balance sheet date, the Group checks whether the asset deriving from a contract has suffered impairment according to IFRS 9; - Receivables: the unconditional right to a consideration. The right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required to make the payment due. At each reporting date, the Group checks for any impairment according to IFRS 9; - Contract liabilities: the obligation to transfer to the customer any goods or services for which consideration has been received from the customer. If the customer pays the consideration before the goods or services have been transferred, the contract is presented as a liability deriving from a contract at the time the payment is made. The contract assets and contract liabilities relating to existing contracts are shown net in the statement of financial position as follows: - the amount due from customers for contract work in progress is recorded as an asset, under Contract assets, when it exceeds any advances that have been received; - advances received on contract work in progress are recorded as a liability, under Contract liabilities, when they exceed the relative amount owed by the customers. This analysis is carried out for each project. Exchange rate differences realized on the collection of receivables or the settlement of payables denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement. Unrealized exchange differences arising from the translation of monetary items at the year-end spot exchange are taken to the income statement. _Group companies_ The translation into Euros of the financial statements of foreign companies included within the scope of consolidation is carried out by applying the current exchange rate at the closing date to balance sheet assets and liabilities, and the average exchange rates for the period to items in the income statement. Exchange rate differences deriving from the translation of initial net equity at the rates current at the end of the period and from the translation of the income statement at the same rates at the end of the period are recognized as a separate component of equity called the translation reserve. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation is accounted for as an asset of the foreign operation and translated at the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with an opposite entry made to the translation reserve. The principal exchange rates, as reported by the European Central Bank and used for the translation to Euro of foreign currency amounts, are as follows: The parameters used when making estimates are analytically commented on in the section on accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are regularly revised and the effects of any changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. The marginal financing rates applied were determined on the basis of the geographical area in which the contracts were stipulated and according to the maturity band to which the contracts belong. The weighted average of the rate applied is approximately 3%.

The Group does not expect any significant impacts on its assets and liabilities, results and financial position from applying these standards. The Group’s maximum theoretical credit risk exposure at 31 December 2019 is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets stated in the financial statements, and by the nominal value of the guarantees given as described in Note 31. _Exchange rate risk_ The current business activities of companies of the Group whose functional currency is the euro, which actively operate in markets outside the euro area, are exposed to exchange rate risk, mainly with respect to sales in the US dollar area. The Group’s policy on exchange-rate risk provides for the use of forward contracts to hedge between 70% and 90% of future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, depending on whether they consist of budgeted flows of sales in foreign currencies or flows from the backlog acquired. Changes in exchange rates between the date of invoicing and the date of receipt of funds are managed separately, without recourse to hedge accounting, by offset against similar payment flows. Group investments in foreign subsidiaries are not hedged since the foreign currency positions are considered to be long term.

If the initial recognition of a business combination can only be determined provisionally, the adjustments to the values initially assigned are recognized within twelve months of the acquisition date. Minority (or “non-controlling”) interests in equity and net profit are shown as separate items in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement, respectively. If a subsidiary is not wholly owned, the minority interest in equity is determined with reference to its portion of the fair value of assets and liability at the time control was acquired, excluding any attributable goodwill (partial goodwill method). Alternatively, the entire amount of the goodwill generated by the acquisition is recognized, taking account of the portion attributable to the minority interest (full goodwill method); in this last case, the minority interest is stated at its total fair value, including the goodwill attributable to it. The choice of method for determining the amount of goodwill (partial goodwill method or full goodwill method) is decided on a case-by-case basis for each business combination. Payables, receivables, costs and revenue between the companies included in the scope of consolidation, as well as the effects of all material transactions between them, have been eliminated on consolidation. Specifically, unrealized gains with third parties deriving from transactions between Group companies have been eliminated, including those from the valuation of inventories at the reporting date. _Associated companies_ An associate is a company over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence means the power to participate in the determination of financial and operating policies, without exercising control or joint control. Such influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds an interest of between 20% and 50% of voting rights. The consolidated financial statements include the share of the net profits and losses of associated companies, valued using the equity method, from the date on which significant influence begins until the date that it ends. Profits and losses pertaining to the Group after the purchase of associates are recognized in the income statement. Equity investments in associates are initially recorded at purchase cost. Any excess of purchase cost over the Group’s proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired is included in the value of the investment. _Joint ventures_ A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that exercise joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control arises under a contractual agreement to share control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control. Investments in joint ventures are recognized using the equity method. A list of the companies included in the consolidation is provided in paragraph H of the Notes, with an indication of the consolidation method used.

The merger also received the favourable opinion of the committee consisting solely of unrelated independent directors of GIMA TT S.p.A. in accordance with the provisions of the related party procedure of GIMA TT S.p.A. The merger was carried out for the following purposes: (i) to create a company with a higher free float, both in terms of percentage of capital and in absolute value, with shares that are easier to trade and more attractive to investors; (ii) to reduce operating costs for the maintenance of two listed companies and simplify the shareholding structure and the corporate governance structure, thereby generating synergies for the benefit of all shareholders; and (iii) to allow management to devote itself fully to operational management of the “Tobacco” division, minimizing elements of distraction attributable to the volatility that has occurred in the sector, which was not foreseeable at the time that GIMA TT S.p.A. was listed in 2017. To identify the economic elements of the merger, the Boards of Directors of the companies participating in the merger, with the help of financial advisors of proven professionalism and experience, have applied valuation methods commonly used for mergers between companies with characteristics similar to those of IMA S.p.A. and GIMA TT S.p.A.. The exchange ratio is based on assessments of the companies resulting from the application of various methods according to best national and international market practices. The merger plan was prepared on the basis of the financial statements at 31 December 2018 of the companies participating in the merger, approved by their respective ordinary shareholders’ meetings on 30 April 2019 and used as merger balance sheets for the purposes of art. 2501-quater of the Italian Civil Code. On 14 June 2019, the President of the Bologna Business Tribunal, in the section that specialises in company law, appointed EY S.p.A., chosen by both IMA S.p.A. and GIMA TT S.p.A., as the joint expert to draw up the report on the fairness of the exchange ratio. Their report said that the methods used to calculate the exchange ratio were suitable. The Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings of IMA S.p.A. and GIMA TT S.p.A. approved the merger plan by absorption on 8 August 2019. Subsequently, on 31 October 2019 IMA S.p.A. and GIMA TT S.p.A. signed the merger deed, which was registered with the Bologna Companies Register on the same date. The procedure was therefore successfully concluded and the merger took effect from 5 November 2019 (Effective Date), with the consequent termination of GIMA TT S.p.A.. On the other hand, the accounting and tax effects of the merger were backdated to 1 January 2019, in line with the fact that, in this transaction, control over the merged company’s activities does not change, but goes from indirect to direct control. The reverse merger in question qualifies as a combination of companies under common control. This transaction only generated impacts on the consolidated financial statements with reference to relations with minority shareholders, in compliance with the provisions of IFRS 10. F-96 ----- On the Effective Date, IMA S.p.A. increased its share capital by a total nominal amount of 2,055,304.68 euros by issuing 3,952,509 shares to service the share exchange at a ratio of 11.4 ordinary shares of IMA with a par value of 0.52 euros each for every 100 ordinary shares of GIMA TT S.p.A. In application of this exchange ratio, GIMA TT S.p.A. shareholders, other than IMA, were assigned 3,952,509 new ordinary shares of IMA, with the same dividend date and characteristics as the IMA ordinary shares already in circulation on the Effective Date. Their holders were also granted the same rights as those due to holders of the ordinary shares of IMA in circulation at the time of the assignment. These newly issued shares were listed on the Electronic Stock Market organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (MTA). Since the Effective Date, the share capital of IMA S.p.A. has therefore had a nominal amount of 22,470,504.68 euros, divided into 43,212,509 ordinary shares with a par value of 0.52 euros each, listed on the MTA. The IMA shares assigned to serve the merger were made available to GIMA TT S.p.A. shareholders starting from the Effective Date through the depositary intermediaries belonging to Monte Titoli S.p.A. (Appointed Intermediaries). On that date, the ordinary shares representing the entire share capital of GIMA TT S.p.A. were cancelled and delisted from the MTA. The Merger Deed is available to the public on the websites www.ima.it and www.gimatt.it. _Merger plan for the absorption of GIMA S.p.A., G.S. Coating Technologies S.r.l., Mapster S.r.l. and Revisioni Industriali S.r.l. by the parent company IMA S.p.A._ In June 2019, the plans for IMA S.p.A. to absorb its direct or indirect subsidiaries GIMA S.p.A., G.S. Coating Technologies S.r.l., Mapster S.r.l. and Revisioni Industriali S.r.l. were filed with the local Companies Register. These mergers, in a simplified form and, therefore without a share exchange, without an increase in capital and without any change in the articles of association of the merging company, have been implemented on the basis of their respective financial statements at 31 December 2018.

This change reflects the fact that monitoring for internal management purposes, which was previously handled in a more independent manner by each company, since 2019 now takes place Division by Division, using the same approach for them all. So, from this Annual Report, management has identified new “CGU Groups” which represent the new minimum unit for monitoring goodwill. This revision of the CGUs complies with the accounting standards and the guidelines laid down in the OIV’s discussion paper, Exposure Draft 2019, also through the assistance of an external consultant, and was approved by the Board of Directors on 12 March 2020. As regards the goodwill recognized on the acquisitions of ATOP, CMRE, Luna Investment, Spares & More and Claren, Spreafico, Tecmar and Perfect Pack, please refer to the comments in Note 30. As mentioned in the section on “Accounting policies”, goodwill, which is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, is tested for impairment. The main assumptions, methods and parameters used in impairment testing are set out below. The goodwill paid when acquiring companies, firms or business divisions is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) of the Group as represented by the individual divisions and/or business units to which they relate. Even if such companies had merged into the acquiring company after the acquisition and had thus lost their legal status, the Group organization into divisions makes it possible to identify the assets and the cash flows of said CGUs, and to check whether allocated goodwill is recoverable through the impairment test. The recoverable value of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated is tested by determining their value in use, as represented by the present value of expected cash flows discounted using a rate that reflects the risks specific to each CGU at the measurement date. The formulas used to test impairment and to calculate the terminal value are as follows: _FCF = Free Cash Flow, or cash flow produced from managing the operations WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital N = Number of years in the discount period TV = Terminal Value, i.e. the current value of the cash flows generated after the end of the discount period FCFn = Free Cash Flow sustainable after the end of the discount period g = Growth rate of the business beyond the assumed period of the plan_ Management has assumed an explicit forecast period of 3 years for all CGUs, except the ATOP CGU for which it is 5 years. At the end of the explicit forecast period (2022, or 2024 for the ATOP CGU), a “normalized flow” is also calculated in order to estimate the terminal value. The CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discounting rate, as determined from a detailed analysis of the capital structure of each CGU. F-110 ----- The Capital Asset Pricing Model is used. This mathematical model determines the rate by summing the returns from a risk-free asset with the market risk premium. In turn, the market risk premium is found by multiplying the market average risk by the beta for the specific sector. The principal assumptions underlying the application of this method involved estimating the future increases in sales, the gross margin, operating costs, the rate of growth of terminal values, capital investment, operating capital and the weighted-average cost of capital (discount rate). The cash flows are estimated on the basis of the 2020 budget (approved by the Board of Directors on 12 March 2020) and the 2021-2022 business plan (already discussed at a Board meeting); they are then discounted at rates that reflect current market valuations of the cost of capital taking account of the specific risk profile of each CGU. The growth rate g used is zero for the sake of prudence, with the exception of the ATOP CGU where it is equal to 1 due to the significant growth expected for the E-traction market. This means that any sensitivity analysis, designed to measure the change in results on a change in the assumptions used for the growth rate, including changes in the other parameters contributing to the formation of WACC, would result in better impairment results. With reference to the values of goodwill at 31 December 2019, the impairment test procedures, applied on the basis of the methodologies and assumptions described above, found the carrying amounts to be fully recoverable. Given the current situation of market volatility and uncertainty about future economic prospects, sensitivity analyses were carried out on the recoverable value of goodwill. In particular, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the recoverable value of the individual CGUs, assuming an increase of one percentage point in the component of the discount rate represented by the market risk premium. These sensitivity analyses confirmed the full recoverability of goodwill. The table shows the detailed growth assumptions used in the forecasts and the discount rates applied in the impairment procedures: CAGR 2020-2022 Sales % Goodwill Average weighted cost of capital employed WACC % CGU ATOP(*) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 239,761 6.17 18.6 CGU Automation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16,442 5.24 2.2 CGU Coffee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,457 6.17 5.3 CGU Food & Dairy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41,835 6.17 3.4 CGU Flex Pack . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38,460 6.14 2.7 CGU Tea . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16,904 6.17 2.8 CGU Tissue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37,628 6.17 3.4 CGU Active . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,505 6.17 4.0 CGU Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,467 6.23 1.5 CGU Safe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34,961 6.17 2.0 _(*)_ _The CAGR of the ATOP CGU refers to the period 2020-2024._ Management has formalised separate impairment tests, indicating: - the object and reasons for the Group’s acquisition; - identification of the intangibles and their allocation to the CGU; - the business plan of the CGU; - the definition of recoverable value. The assumptions used in calculating the impairment included in the business plan of each CGU and the results achieved have been approved by the Board of Directors of IMA S.p.A., independently and prior to these financial statements. The impairment tests of goodwill conducted in accordance with IAS 36 did not lead to any writedowns. This monitoring was carried out on the basis of the new aggregation of CGUs, considered to be 1st level, and on the basis of the previous aggregation, considered to be 2nd level. F-111 ----- In addition, during prior years, the amounts of goodwill of the Nova Group (Safe CGU), Zanchetta and ICO OLEODINAMICI (Active CGU) were written down by 757 thousand euros, 2,500 thousand euros and 1,500 thousand euros, respectively. Assets under development and advances mainly relate to the capitalization of development costs incurred by the Parent Company (20,282 thousand euros), GIMA S.p.A. (2,341 thousand euros) and Tissue Machinery Company S.p.A. (1,323 thousand euros) and concern new products that were not previously available and are targeted at new market segments. Assets under development have been tested for impairment, but no adjustments emerged. The Group does not have any associated companies that are individually significant. Trade payables to associates reflects the Group’s constant commitment in pursuing close collaboration with those suppliers that play a key role in production, also by considering the possibility of becoming shareholders in their companies. The Group’s share of the aggregate amount of profit from associated companies accounted for using the equity method in 2019 amounts to -4,682 thousand euros (2,485 thousand euros the previous year). The amount for the current year includes the impairment loss of IMA Dairy & Food commented on above. During 2019, the subsidiary Packaging Manufacturing Industry S.r.l. acquired 32% of A.P.M.

In the current year, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company IMA S.p.A. proposes to pay out a dividend of 2.00 euros (gross) per share. As this dividend is subject to approval of the Shareholders’ Meeting, it was not recognized as a liability at 31 December 2019. _FAIR VALUE RESERVE_ Changes in the fair value reserve break down as follows: in thousands of euros In addition, this item includes the reserve on the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, the movements of which during the period were as follows: in thousands of euros _(**) Absorbed by IMA S.p.A. in November 2019. For detailed information, please refer to the comments in the “Scope of consolidation” section._ Transworld Packaging Holding S.p.A. controls twelve companies, either directly or indirectly. For further information, see the list of equity investments provided in section H of the explanatory notes. At 31 December 2019, minority interests amount to 11,355 thousand euros (23,898 thousand euros at 31 December 2018) and relate to ATOP S.p.A. for 9,347 thousand euros. As previously commented in Note 13, “Share capital”, the absorption of GIMA TT S.p.A. by IMA S.p.A. took effect from 5 November 2019, with effect for accounting and tax purposes backdated to 1 January 2019. IMA S.p.A. increased its share capital by 11.4 IMA ordinary shares for every 100 ordinary shares of GIMA TT S.p.A. and therefore the interest in GIMA TT S.p.A., which at 31 December 2018 amounted to 22,374 thousand euros, is zero at the reporting date. The dividends paid to minority shareholders in 2019 amounted to 14,607 thousand euros and refer for 14,562 thousand euros to GIMA TT S.p.A. (17,204 thousand euros in 2018, of which 14,754 thousand euros attributable to GIMA TT S.p.A.). During 2019, GIMA S.p.A. and Eurosicma S.p.A. purchased 10% of Dreamer S.r.l. and 30% of O.A.SYS. S.r.l. respectively from third parties, as mentioned in the “Scope of consolidation” section. The effect of these transactions was recognized as a deduction from equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent company for an amount of 275 thousand euros. The IMA Group does not have any subsidiaries with significant minority interests at 31 December 2019. During the previous year, GIMA TT S.p.A. was the only company with significant minority interests. _Applied research and technological innovation loans_ During the period, instalments of 1,919 thousand euros were paid regularly as they fell due and new loans of 2,931 thousand euros were received. _Other loans_ The principal changes in other loans relate to the Parent Company and comprise new loans of 220,000 thousand euros, mainly involved in the acquisition of ATOP as commented on below, and repayments of 25,800 thousand euros.

Total non-current financial assets differs from that reported in the balance sheet as it does not include equity interests in other companies. For further information on the breakdown of the items in net debt, see Notes 5 and 12. The Group also has payables in respect of acquisitions totalling 113,866 thousand euros (65,880 thousand euros at 31 December 2018), essentially relating to the options agreed for the purchase of the minority interests in subsidiaries. The change compared with the previous period is mainly due to the recognition of payables relating to the acquisitions of ATOP, Perfect Pack, Spreafico and Tecmar.

Castel Guelfo Bologna-Italy 25,000 EUR 20%(2) - Sirio S.p.A. Associazione in part ecipazione Milan Milan-Italy accrued cash movements and the revenue or cost elements deriving from cash flows attributable to investment or financing activities. The Group classifies interest and dividends as cash flows from financing activities. The figures contained in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2018 are expressed in thousands of euros, except where otherwise indicated. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised each year on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: - Industrial patents and intellectual property rights 3-15 years - Software, licences and similar rights 5-15 years - Trademarks 10-20 years - Development costs 5-15 years Assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for possible impairment of value on an annual basis, or more frequently if evidence suggests an impairment has occurred. Research costs are charged to the income statement as soon as they are incurred. Development costs that qualify for capitalization as assets under IAS 38 (in relation to their technical feasibility, the intention and ability of the enterprise to complete, use or sell the assets, the availability of the resources required for the completion of the development project and the ability to measure the expenditure reliably) are generally amortised in relation to their future economic utility. Amortisation begins from the moment the products become available for economic use. The estimate of useful life is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes in projected future utility. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s share of the net fair value of those purchased assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that can be identified individually and recognized separately. Goodwill is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is not amortised. It is allocated to the related cash-generating units (CGUs) and, pursuant to IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), undergoes impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changed circumstances indicate a probable impairment of value. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is recognized at acquisition price net of any accumulated impairment. authorised, except when the Group benefits from these proceeds as recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case these profits are recognized in OCI. Equity instruments recognized at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment testing. _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss_ This category includes assets held for trading, assets designated at the time of initial recognition as financial assets at fair value with changes recognized in the income statement, or financial assets that must necessarily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all those assets acquired with a view to selling or repurchasing them in the short term. Derivatives, including those that are unbundled, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not represented solely by principal and interest payments are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, regardless of the business model. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of profit or loss for the year. Taxes relating to prior periods include revenue and expenses recognized during the year for income tax relating to prior years. - Receivables: the unconditional right to the consideration. The right to compensation is unconditional if only the passage of time is needed to make the payment due. At each balance sheet date, the Group verifies any reduction in value in accordance with IFRS 9; - Contract liabilities: the obligation to transfer goods or services to the customer for which a consideration has been received from the customer. If the customer pays the consideration before the good or service is transferred, the contract is presented as a contract liability at the time the payment is made. The contract assets and contract liabilities relating to existing contracts are shown net in the statement of financial position as follows: - the amount due from customers for contract work in progress is recorded as an asset, under Contract assets, when it exceeds any advances that have been received; - advances received on contract work in progress are recorded as a liability, under Contract liabilities, when they exceed the relative amount owed by the customers. This analysis is carried out for each individual project. Exchange rate differences deriving from the translation of initial net equity at the rates current at the end of the period and from the translation of the income statement at the same rates at the end of the period are recognized as a separate component of equity called the translation reserve. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation is accounted for as an asset of the foreign operation and translated at the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with an opposite entry made to the translation reserve. The principal exchange rates, as reported by the European Central Bank and used for the translation to Euro of foreign currency amounts, are as follows: **2018** **2017** Average Average Final exchange Final exchange exchange rate for exchange rate for Currency** rate the year rate the year USdollar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.145 1.181 1.199 1.129 GBpound sterling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.895 0.885 0.887 0.876 Indian rupee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 79.730 80.733 76.605 73.498 Chineseyuan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.875 7.808 7.804 7.626 Swissfranc . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.127 1.155 1.170 1.111 IAS 29 Accounting in Hyperinflationary Economies does not establish an absolute inflation rate above which hyperinflation occurs. One of the situations that are considered indicative is a cumulative rate of inflation over a three-year period of 100% or more. After a long period of observation of inflation levels and other indicators, a general consensus was reached in considering Argentina among the countries operating in a hyperinflationary economy. So, from 1 January 2018 the Group has applied IAS 29 to the subsidiary whose functional currency is the Argentine peso. - revenue from contracts with customers, - contract assets and liabilities, - liabilities for employee benefits, - liabilities calculated as the current value of the exercise price of purchase options on minority interests, - bad debt provisions, - provisions for risks and charges. With reference to goodwill and other intangible assets, the processes and methods for evaluating and determining estimates are based on complex assumptions regarding revenue, operating costs, margins, investments, terminal value growth rates and discount rates, to differentiate for each CGU based on different markets in which the Group operates. About revenue from contracts with customers for contract work and contract assets and liabilities, application of the cost-to-cost method requires a prior estimate of the entire lifetime costs of individual projects, updating them at each balance sheet date. This requires assumptions to be made by the directors. These assumptions can be influenced by multiple factors, such as, for example, the time span of several years over which some projects are developed, their high technological level and innovative content, any variances and price revisions, the performance guarantees of the machines, including an estimate of contractual risks, if any. These facts and circumstances make it difficult to estimate the projects’ costs to complete and, consequently, to estimate the value of contract work in progress at the balance sheet date. The parameters used when making estimates are analytically commented on in the section on accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are regularly revised and the effects of any changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. transfer of ownership was when title or possession of the goods was transferred to the buyer, which generally coincided with shipment. The only exception was revenue from contract work, which was recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. The new standard (IFRS 15) provides for the recognition of revenue for an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity believes that it is entitled to in exchange for transfer of the goods or services to the customer. The new standard replaces all previous IFRS requisites for revenue recognition and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the Group assessed the effects of IFRS 15, which showed that the method of accounting for revenue streams appears to be substantially consistent with the principles contained in the new standard. Adopting the new IFRS 15, which we applied with the revised retrospective method with effect from 1 January 2018, involved identifying the following revenue streams: machines and contracts in progress, change parts, spare parts and other materials, and technical assistance. Moreover, “Revenue” for 2017 has been renamed “Revenue from contracts with customers”. Application of this standard only entailed a different presentation of the performance obligation linked to technical assistance in progress and, in particular, to commissioning services. This change had an incremental effect on revenue and on the costs of technical assistance in 2018 of the same amount corresponding to approximately 10.757 thousand euros, so with a zero impact on the result for the year and on shareholders’ equity at 1 January 2018. Application of the new standard has not had significant impacts on the Group’s assets and liabilities, results or financial position. As required by the standard, contract assets and liabilities have been shown separately from Trade and other receivables and Trade and other payables.

IFRS 9 was issued in its final version in July 2015 and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the project on accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. With the exception of hedge accounting, retrospective application of the standard is required, but it is not obligatory to provide comparative information. As regards hedge accounting, the standard generally applies prospectively, with some limited exceptions. The new standard is designed to simplify the reader’s understanding of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of cash flows by replacing the various categories of financial instruments envisaged in IAS 39. F-182 ----- _Classification and Measurement_ IFRS 9 introduces a new approach for the classification of all financial instruments, including derivatives embedded in other financial instruments, based on the logic of the “cash flow” and the “business model” for which the asset is held, replacing the previous rules that turned out to be difficult to apply. The Group has verified the methods of classification of the financial instruments envisaged by IAS 39 with respect to the new criteria envisaged by IFRS 9 and has carried out the following mandatory or optional reclassifications at 1 January 2018: IFRS 9 measurement category in thousands of euros Amortized cost FVOCI FVPL IAS 39 measurement category: Financial receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,759 7,759 — — Investments held to maturity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — — — — Financial assets measured at fair value recognized in the income statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — — — — Financial assets available for sale . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,156 — 14,174 982 For details of the items reported, see Note 5 Financial assets. _Impairment_ IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model required by IAS 39 with a forecasting model of “expected credit loss” (ECL). The model assumes a significant level of assessment regarding the impact of changes in economic factors on the ECL that will be weighted according to probabilities. The new impairment loss model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI, with the exception of equities and assets deriving from contracts with customers. The standard provides that credit provisions should be assessed using the following approaches: the General deterioration method and the Simplified approach; in particular: - the General Deterioration Method requires financial instruments included in the scope of application of IFRS 9 to be classified in three stages. The three stages reflect the level of deterioration in credit quality from the moment the financial instrument is acquired and involve a different method of calculating ECL; - the Simplified Approach provides for the adoption of a number of simplifications for trade receivables, contract assets and receivables deriving from lease agreements, in order to prevent entities being forced to monitor changes in credit risk, as envisaged by the general model. Recognition of the loss according to the simplified approach has to be permanent (or “lifetime”), in which case stage allocation is not required. One of the operational examples included in the simplified approaches for estimating ECLs is that of the Provision Matrix, which is particularly suitable in the way that it is constructed for assessing trade receivables due from a clientèle that is highly differentiated, but which can be categorised in the same risk classes. In fact, different writedown rates will be determined in the provision matrix, grouping together in the proposed matrix above all the receivables based on the days of that they are past due. In addition to this aggregation variable, the standard says that loss rates can be estimated by classes of customers that show the same loss path. The standard does not lay down a single principle for customer segmentation, leaving each entity free to select the sample sub-sets in order to make them consistent, based on individual experiences. So depending on the individual customer base, each entity will organize the provision matrix by dividing its customers into clusters by using different factors and variables, such as geographical area, product area, credit rating, etc. As we said earlier, in cases where the General Deterioration Method is applied, the financial instruments are classified in three stages according to the deterioration of the credit quality between the date of initial recognition and that of measurement: - Stage 1 — for activities that have not undergone a significant increase in credit risk with respect to those recorded at the time of initial recognition or if they have a low credit risk on the reference F-183 ----- date, a provision must be recognized that reflects the 12-month ECL: expected losses will be estimated on the basis of possible default events in the following 12 months, with a reduced impact of the calculation on ECLs. In fact, for this category of instruments, the standard makes it possible to reduce the coefficients, as the parameters will not be estimated over a time horizon that reflects the entire residual life of the instrument, permitting a saving in terms of the amount to be accrued to the bad debt provision; - Stage 2 and 3 — on the other hand, for assets that have undergone a significant increase in credit risk, the entity has to recognize a provision equal to the expected losses over the entire residual life of these financial assets, taking into account the probability of default that could occur over the entire life of the instrument (“Lifetime ECL”). In order to define the methodological approach to be applied to assets undergoing impairment, an analysis was made of the financial assets in portfolio subject to impairment, with particular reference to trade receivables and contract assets representing the majority of the Group’s credit exposure. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group generally establishes qualitative and quantitative thresholds to define the default of these positions, which are valued using the IFRS 9 simplified approach (ECL = EAD x PD x LGD). For positions that do not exceed these qualitative and quantitative thresholds, the Group assesses the ECL by dividing these credits into specific clusters, also taking into account the geographical area, the product area and the credit rating, applying the impairment model based on expected losses through the operational exemplification of the provision matrix. A simplified approach was applied to the trade receivables deemed individually significant by management and for which more precise information is available on the significant increase in credit risk within the simplified model. Application of the new impairment model has not had significant impacts on the Group’s assets and liabilities, results or financial position. Impairment losses determined in accordance with IFRS 9 are presented separately in the income statement if the amount is considered significant. _Hedge accounting_ As regards hedging instruments, the most significant changes compared with the hedge accounting model proposed by IAS 39 concern the possibility of deferring the time value of an option, the forward component of a forward contract and the currency basis spreads (i.e. hedging costs) in OCI up to the moment in which the hedged item impacts the income statement. The type of derivatives and forward purchases/sales in foreign currency currently subscribed by the Group is not affected by the new standard; the intrinsic value can therefore continue to be shown in the cash flow hedge reserve as there are no changes on this point with respect what was previously required by IAS 39. The Group has chosen to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39, as permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.21. The other amendments and interpretations of accounting standards and methods in force from 1 January 2018 govern circumstances and situations that are not relevant to the Group’s consolidated financial statements or, in any case, not significant: - Amendments to IFRS 2 — Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions; - Amendments to IFRS 9 — Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts; - Amendments to IAS 40 — Transfer of Investment Property; - Annual cycle of improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 — includes some amendments to IFRS 1 (Firsttime adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards — Cancellation of Short-Term Exemptions for First-Time Adopters) and IAS 28 (Investments in Associated Companies and Joint Ventures — Clarification that the recognition of an investment at fair value through profit or loss for the year is a choice that applies to the individual investment); - IFRIC Interpretation 22 — Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration. F-184 ----- “Other” refers mainly to various considerations on the duration of the contracts made when analysing the contracts that were outstanding at the transition date. Application of IFRS 16 will not have effects for the purpose of calculating the financial parameters (or “covenants”) required by existing loan agreements. The following is a list of the other standards and interpretations that had already been issued at the time this document was being prepared, but were not yet in force: - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts; - IFRIC – Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments; - Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation; - Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement; - Amendments to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures; - Annual cycle of improvements to IFRS 2015-2017 – includes some amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23; - Amendments to IFRS 10 and to IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture. The Group does not expect any significant impacts on its assets and liabilities, results and financial position from applying these standards. Financing activities are primarily directed towards Group companies and are therefore considered to be at very low probability of risk. It should be noted that at 31 December 2018 the Group was not party to any sovereign debt positions with redemption risks. Sureties and other non-bank guarantees are given mainly on behalf of subsidiaries to back loans and financing extended by banks or commitments to pay lease instalments. In the case of financing activities linked to temporary excess liquidity or of the use of financial instruments (derivatives), the Group operates solely with counterparties with high credit standing. The Group’s maximum theoretical credit risk exposure at 31 December 2018 is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets stated in the financial statements, and by the nominal value of the guarantees given as described in Note 31. _Further information on the composition of the above items is provided in Notes 15, 18 and 32._ At 31 December 2018 the Group had about 462 million euros available in unused lines of credit (363 million euros at 31 December 2017) and cash and cash equivalents of 141 million euros (207 million euros at 31 December 2017). As to the balancing of net working capital, especially the coverage of payables to suppliers, net trade receivables came to 384 million euros at 31 December 2018 (325 million euros at 31 December 2017).

Alternatively, the entire amount of the goodwill generated by the acquisition is recognized, taking account of the portion attributable to the minority interest (full goodwill method); in this last case, the minority interest is stated at its total fair value, including the goodwill attributable to it. The choice of method for determining the amount of goodwill (partial goodwill method or full goodwill method) is decided on a case-by-case basis for each business combination. Payables, receivables, costs and revenue between the companies included in the scope of consolidation, as well as the effects of all material transactions between them, have been eliminated on consolidation. Specifically, unrealized gains with third parties deriving from transactions between Group companies have been eliminated, including those from the valuation of inventories at the reporting date. _Associated companies_ An associate is a company over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence means the power to participate in the determination of financial and operating policies, without exercising control or joint control. Such influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds an interest of between 20% and 50% of voting rights. The consolidated financial statements include the share of the net profits and losses of associated companies, valued using the equity method, from the date on which significant influence begins until the date that it ends. Profits and losses pertaining to the Group after the purchase of associates are recognized in the income statement. Equity investments in associates are initially recorded at purchase cost. Any excess of purchase cost over the Group’s proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired is included in the value of the investment. _Joint ventures_ A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that exercise joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control arises under a contractual agreement to share control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control. Investments in joint ventures are recognized using the equity method. - on 5 April 2018, IMA, through its subsidiary GIMA S.p.A., exercised the option to purchase a further 31% of Petroncini Impianti S.p.A., with operations based in Sant’Agostino (FE), which is market leader in machinery for the production of coffee, thereby bringing its overall interest in the company to 80%.

The value of the transaction was 18,000 thousand euros, of which 13,000 thousand euros was paid at the closing with the rest to be paid by June 2019. The sale resulted in a loss of 26,165 thousand euros, including ancillary expenses of 1,580 thousand euros; for further information, see Note 28 Profit (loss) from discontinued activities/disposal groups. - Benhil GmbH and Hassia Packaging Pvt.

It was previously being rented and it is where the company currently has its registered office, offices and production plants. The lease has a duration of 8 years, amount financed of 8,840 thousand euros, an advance fee of 20% and a redemption price equal to 10% of the amount financed. A derivative contract to hedge against interest rate risk was stipulated for this transaction. In addition, at 31 December 2018 leased assets essentially relate to the contract for the factory in Krakow (Poland) used by Ilapak Sp. Z o.o. (this contract was signed with BZ WBK Finanse & Leasing S.A. in 2009 and expires in February 2019), as well as to the Parent Company’s industrial building in Collecchio (PR). See Note 15 for information on minimum future lease payments. Financial charges directly attributable to property, plant and equipment are generally recognized in the income statement because the Group does not have any assets that normally take a substantial period of time to make ready for use. There are no restrictions on ownership or tangible assets pledged as security for liabilities. There are no internal or external elements to suggest that assets have suffered an impairment in value. F-204 ----- - Petroncini Impianti S.p.A., occurred in 2018, for 7,128 thousand euros; - Eurosicma business for 16,583 thousand euros; - Medtech business for 1,901 thousand euros; - Benhil GmbH and Hassia Packaging Pvt Ltd. for 8,263 thousand euros; - Ilapak Group for 7,692 thousand euros; - Dairy&Convenience Food business of the Corazza Group for 3,706 thousand euros. In addition, this caption includes costs of 11,237 thousand euros incurred by the Parent Company on projects related to the Pharmaceutical sector and of 4,756 thousand euros on the development for the Tea sector. As also mentioned in the report on operations, research and development costs that do not meet the requirements for capitalization were charged to profit and loss for an amount of 55,314 thousand euros (50,995 thousand euros in the previous period). Industrial patents and intellectual property rights include costs incurred for the acquisition of rights deriving from applications for industrial patents, stated net of related amortisation. The increase is primarily due to the expenses incurred for the extension and maintenance of patents in other countries. Software, licences, trademarks and other rights mainly include applications, management and technical software and intangible assets related to customers (“customer list”) and trademarks for 61,451 thousand euros and 30,145 thousand euros respectively, recognized following the acquisitions of Eurosicma, Ilapak, Corazza, TMC, Petroncini and Ciemme.

Even if such companies had merged into the acquiring company after the acquisition and had thus lost their legal status, the Group organization into divisions makes it possible to identify the assets and the cash flows of said CGUs, and to check whether allocated goodwill is recoverable through the impairment test. The recoverable value of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated is tested by determining their value in use, as represented by the present value of expected cash flows discounted using a rate that reflects the risks specific to each CGU at the measurement date. The formulas used to test impairment and to calculate the terminal value are as follows: _FCF = Free Cash Flow, or cash flow generated by operations WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital N = Number of years in the discount period TV = present value of the Terminal Value, i.e. the value of the cash flows generated after the end of the discount period FCFn = Free Cash Flow sustainable after the end of the discount period g = Growth rate of the business beyond the assumed period of the plan_ Management has assumed an explicit forecast period of 3 years. At the end of the explicit forecast period (2021), a “normalized flow” is also calculated in order to estimate the terminal value. The CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discounting rate, as determined from a detailed analysis of the capital structure of each CGU. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is used. This mathematical model determines the rate by summing the returns from a risk-free asset with the market risk premium. In turn, the market risk premium is found by multiplying the market average risk by the beta for the specific sector. The principal assumptions underlying the application of this method involved estimating the future increases in sales, the gross margin, operating costs, the rate of growth of terminal values, capital investment, operating capital and the weighted-average cost of capital (discount rate). The cash flows are estimated on the basis of the 2019 budget (approved by the Board of Directors on 15 March 2019) and the 2020-2021 business plan (already discussed at a Board meeting); they are then discounted at rates that reflect current market valuations of the cost of capital taking account of the specific risk profile of each CGU. The growth rate g used is zero for the sake of prudence. This means that any sensitivity analysis, designed to measure the change in results on a change in the assumptions used for the growth rate, including changes in the other parameters contributing to formation of the WACC, would result in better impairment results. Given the current situation of market volatility and uncertainty about future economic prospects, sensitivity analyses were carried out on the recoverable value of goodwill. In particular, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the recoverable value of the individual CGUs, assuming an increase of one percentage point in the component of the discount rate represented by the market risk premium. These sensitivity analyses confirmed the full recoverability of goodwill, with the exception of the TMC and Petroncini CGUs, for which there was a potential negative difference between the recoverable value and the carrying amount.

Milan Milan - Italy non-monetary transactions, any deferral of operational collections and payments already made, any accrued cash movements, the revenue or costs deriving from cash flows attributable to investment or financing activities. The Group classifies interest and dividends as cash flows from financing activities. The figures contained in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2017 are expressed in thousands of euros, except where otherwise indicated. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised each year on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: - Industrial patents and intellectual property rights 3-15 years - Software, licences and similar rights 5-15 years - Trademarks 10-20 years - Development costs 5-15 years Assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for possible impairment of value on an annual basis, or more frequently if evidence suggests an impairment has occurred. Research costs are charged to the income statement as soon as they are incurred. Development costs that qualify for capitalization as assets under IAS 38 (in relation to their technical feasibility, the intention and ability of the enterprise to complete, use or sell the assets, the availability of the resources required for the completion of the development project and the ability to measure the expenditure reliably) are generally amortised in relation to their future economic utility. Amortisation begins from the moment the products become available for economic use. The estimate of useful life is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes in projected future utility. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s share of the net fair value of those purchased assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that can be identified individually and recognized separately. Goodwill is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is not amortised. It is allocated to the related cash-generating units (CGUs) and, pursuant to IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), undergoes impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changed circumstances indicate a probable impairment of value. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is recognized at acquisition price net of any accumulated impairment. Any consideration paid or received, including expenses directly attributable to such equity transactions, net of any related tax benefits, is recognized directly in equity. Current taxes are taxes which are expected to pay based on the taxable income for the year and are calculated using the tax rate applying in the various countries in which the IMA Group operates. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated by applying the liability method to temporary differences between the value of consolidated balance sheet assets and liabilities and the corresponding values recognized for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are determined using the tax rate which is expected to apply when the assets are realized or the liabilities settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that taxable income in future years will be sufficient to realize them. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off-set only when there is a legal entitlement to do so and when they relate to taxes due to the same tax authority. Provision for taxes that might arise on transferring undistributed earnings of subsidiaries are only made if there is a real intention to transfer such earnings. Taxes relating to prior periods include revenue and expenses recognized during the year for income tax relating to prior years. - non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the time the fair value was determined. Exchange rate differences realized on the collection of receivables or the settlement of payables denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement. Unrealized exchange differences arising from the translation of monetary items at the year end spot exchange are taken to the income statement. _Group companies_ The translation into Euros of the financial statements of foreign companies included within the scope of consolidation is carried out by applying the current exchange rate at the closing date to balance sheet assets and liabilities, and the average exchange rates for the period to items in the income statement. Exchange rate differences deriving from the translation of initial net equity at the rates current at the end of the period and from the translation of the income statement at the same rates at the end of the period are recognized as a separate component of equity called the translation reserve. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation is accounted for as an asset of the foreign operation and translated at the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with an opposite entry made to the translation reserve. The principal exchange rates, as reported by the European Central Bank and used for the translation to Euro of foreign currency amounts, are as follows: The financial statements items that require a greater subjectivity on the part of the directors in preparing estimates and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions used can have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements are: - goodwill and other intangible assets, - deferred tax assets, - inventories and contract work, - liabilities for employee benefits, - liabilities calculated as the current value of the strike price of options to buy minority interests, - bad debt provisions, - provisions for risks and charges. With reference to goodwill and other intangible assets, the processes and methods for evaluating and determining estimates are based on complex assumptions regarding revenue, operating costs, margins, investments, terminal value growth rates and discount rates, to differentiate for each CGU on the basis of the different markets in which the Group operates. With reference to contract work, the application of the cost-to-cost method requires a prior estimate of the entire lifetime costs of the individual projects and their updating at each balance sheet date, through the use of assumptions by the directors. These assumptions can be influenced by multiple factors, such as, for example, the time span of several years over which some projects are developed, their high technological level and innovative content, any variances and price revisions, the performance guarantees of the machines, including an estimate of contractual risks, if any. These facts and circumstances make it difficult to estimate the projects’ costs to complete and, consequently, to estimate the value of contract work in progress at the balance sheet date. The parameters used when making estimates are analytically commented on in the section on accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are regularly revised and the effects of any changes are immediately reflected in the income statement. These amendments and changes did not have a significant impact on the Group’s balance sheet, income statement and financial position. From the evaluations carried out, both in terms of quality and quantity, it emerged that the current method of accounting for the revenue stream is substantially consistent with the principles contained in the new standard; therefore, we do not expect any potentially significant impacts on the Group’s assets and liabilities, results and financial position. IFRS 16 was published in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 defines the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases on the balance sheet on the basis of a single model similar to the one used to account for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard will come into force for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. We are not planning to apply the new standards in advance. The Group has begun to carry out an analysis of the potential impact that adoption of the new standard could have on the balance sheet, financial position, income statement and information contained in the Group financial statements and notes. This preliminary assessment may be subject to amendments as a result of a more detailed analysis that is currently underway in 2018. Note that at 31 December 2017 the Group had the following commitments for a total of 148,014 thousand euros, as discussed in Note 31 Commitments: - future minimum lease payments for non-cancellable operating leases totalling 3,227 thousand euros which mainly relate to cars, with 1,629 thousand euros falling due within one year and 1,598 thousand euros between 1 and 5 years; - commitments to rent property for 144,787 thousand euros relating to industrial plants, warehouses and offices with 19,999 thousand euros falling due within one year, 69,017 thousand euros between 1 and 5 years and 55,771 thousand euros over 5 years. Fees paid during the year for operating lease contracts and rentals were 515 thousand euros and 21,072 thousand euros respectively. IFRS 9 was issued in its final version in July 2015 and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the project on accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. With the exception of hedge accounting, retrospective application of the standard is required, but it is not obligatory to provide comparative information. As regards hedge accounting, the standard generally applies prospectively, with some limited exceptions. Based on a preliminary assessment of a qualitative nature, we do not expect there to be any potentially significant impacts on the Group’s assets and liabilities, results and financial position. IFRS 2 was amended by the IASB in June 2016 with the aim of clarifying the accounting treatment of certain share-based payment transactions. These changes are applicable from 1 January 2018. IFRIC 23, issued in June 2017 by the IASB and in force since 1 January 2018, provides indications on how to reflect in the accounting for income taxes the uncertainties regarding the tax treatment of a given situation. The amendments to IAS 28, issued by the IASB in October 2017, with effect from 1 January 2019, have the purpose of clarifying how companies must use IFRS 9 to represent long-term interests in associates or joint ventures for which the equity method is not applied. The amendments to IAS 19, issued by the IASB in February 2018, are intended to specify the way in which companies must determine pension costs when changes to a pension plan occur. IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” specifies how a company should account for a defined benefit pension plan. When a change is made to a plan – an adjustment, a reduction or a regulation – IAS 19 requires a company to re-measure the net asset or liability with defined benefits. The changes require a company to use the updated assumptions from this recalculation to determine the current servicing cost and the net interest for the remainder of the reference period after the plan has been changed. The changes will come into force from 1 January 2019. F-278 ----- The treasury units of the individual companies are responsible for managing this risk, based on the guidelines set out by the finance department, under the coordination of the Parent Company’s treasury unit. The Group has adopted a series of policies and processes designed to optimise the management of financial resources, thus reducing liquidity risk. These include: - maintaining an adequate level of available liquidity; - obtaining sufficient lines of credit; - monitoring forecast liquidity conditions in relation to the corporate planning process. With regard to this type of risk, the Group tends to configure its net debt by financing investments with medium/long-term loans, while meeting current commitments out of the cash flow generated by operations and by using short-term lines of credit. The following tables shows the composition and maturity of financial and trade payables and commitments: The following tables contains an analysis of the effects of exchange-rate risk: The following tables show the breakdown by currency of trade and other receivables and payables at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016: The following tables contains an analysis the effects of these risks: the majority of voting (or similar) rights, the Group considers all significant facts and circumstances in order to determine if it controls the investee, including contractual agreements with other holders of voting rights, rights deriving from contractual agreements and potential voting rights. The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis from the date on which control is acquired until the date such control ceases. Under IFRS 3, the subsidiaries acquired by the Group are accounted for using the purchase method, which establishes that: - the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, calculated as the sum of the fair value of assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group at the date of acquisition and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. The charges relating to the transaction are recognized in the income statement when they are incurred; - the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net assets attributable to the Group is accounted for as goodwill; _Associated companies_ An associate is a company over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence means the power to participate in the determination of financial and operating policies, without exercising control or joint control. Such influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds an interest of between 20% and 50% of voting rights. The consolidated financial statements include the share of the net profits and losses of associated companies, valued using the equity method, from the date on which significant influence begins until the date that it ends. Profits and losses pertaining to the Group after the purchase of associates are recognized in the income statement. Equity investments in associates are initially recorded at purchase cost. Any excess of purchase cost over the Group’s proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired is included in the value of the investment. _Joint venture_ A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that exercise joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control arises under a contractual agreement to share control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control. Investments in joint ventures are recognized using the equity method. the Mercato Telematico Azionario (MTA or screen-traded equities market). Consob’s approval follows the measure of 14 September 2017 by which Borsa Italiana S.p.A. approved the admission to listing of the shares on the MTA. The offering, which was addressed exclusively to institutional investors (“Institutional Placement”) with a view to admission to trading of GIMA TT S.p.A.’s shares on the STAR segment of the MTA, was concluded successfully with the allocation of the maximum number of shares foreseen, i.e. 33,880,000, equal to 38.5% of the company’s share capital. Trading in its shares began on the STAR segment of the MTA on 2 October 2017. The offering price of the shares was set at Euro 12.5 per share and on this basis GIMA TT S.p.A. was capitalised at 1,100 million euros. The total gross proceeds from IMA S.p.A.’s exclusive Institutional Placement amounted to approximately 109,085 thousand euros. At the end of these operations, IMA S.p.A.’s holding in the share capital of GIMA TT S.p.A. has decreased from 70% to 60.084%.

F-288 ----- The following table shows operating profit by segment: Balance sheet information at 31 December 2017 is shown below: Land and buildings refer to the following Group companies: At 31 December 2017 leased assets essentially relate to the contract for the factory in Krakow (Poland) used by Ilapak Sp. Z o.o.; this contract was signed with BZ WBK Finanse & Leasing S.A. in 2009 and expires in February 2019. See Note 15 for information on future minimum payments. Financial charges directly attributable to property, plant and equipment are generally recognized in the income statement because the Group does not have any assets that normally take a substantial period of time to make ready for use. There are no restrictions on ownership or tangible assets pledged as security for liabilities. There are no internal or external elements to suggest that assets have suffered an impairment in value. Development costs include the costs incurred for unpatented technology, the useful life of which has been estimated to be between 5 and 10 years and is attributable to the following acquisitions: - the Medtech business, acquired in 2016, 2,746 thousand euros; - the Dairy&Food business acquired in 2015, 39,521 thousand euros; - DOSA S.r.l. and G.S. Coating Technologies S.r.l. businesses, purchased in 2014, for 273 thousand euros and 1,150 thousand euros respectively; - Ilapak Group, which took place in 2013, for 9,371 thousand euros; - Dairy&Convenience Food business of the Corazza Group, occurred in 2011, for 5,487 thousand euros. In addition, this caption includes costs of 13,267 thousand euros incurred by the Parent Company on projects related to the Pharmaceutical sector and of 2,452 thousand euros on the development for the Tea sector. As also mentioned in the report on operations, research and development costs that do not meet the requirements for capitalization were charged to profit and loss for an amount of 53,995 thousand euros (48,147 thousand euros in the previous period). Industrial patents and intellectual property rights include costs incurred for the acquisition of rights deriving from applications for industrial patents, stated net of related amortisation. The increase is primarily due to the expenses incurred for the extension and maintenance of patents in other countries. Software, licences, trademarks and other rights primarily include operating and technical software applications and intangible assets linked to the “customer list” of 24,029 thousand euros, 6,422 thousand euros and 4,838 thousand euros respectively. They arose on the acquisition of the Dairy&Food business, the Ilapak Group and the Corazza Group. This caption also includes trademarks totalling 16,937 thousand euros that relate to the Dairy&Food business. The increases during the year principally related to acquisition by the Parent Company of software and licenses relating to the commercial, marketing, administrative, logistics and technical areas. F-296 ----- Goodwill comprises the following: The formulas used to test impairment and to calculate the terminal value are as follows: _FCF = Free Cash Flow, or cash flow generated by operations WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital N = Number of years in the discount period TV = present value of the Terminal Value, i.e. the value of the cash flows generated after the end of the discount period FCFn = Free Cash Flow sustainable after the end of the discount period g = Growth rate of the business beyond the assumed period of the plan_ Management has assumed an explicit forecast period of 3 years. At the end of the explicit forecast period (2020), a “normalized flow” is also calculated in order to estimate the terminal value. The CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discounting rate, as determined from a detailed analysis of the capital structure of each CGU. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is used. This mathematical model determines the rate by summing the returns from a risk-free asset with the market risk premium. In turn, the market risk premium is found by multiplying the market average risk by the beta for the specific sector. The principal assumptions underlying the application of this method involved estimating the future increases in sales, the gross margin, operating costs, the rate of growth of terminal values, capital investment, operating capital and the weighted-average cost of capital (discount rate). The cash flows are estimated on the basis of the 2018 budget (approved by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2018) and the 2019-2020 business plan (discussed at the Board meeting); they are then discounted at rates that reflect current market valuations of the cost of capital taking account of the specific risk profile of each CGU. The growth rate g used is zero for the sake of prudence. This means that any sensitivity analysis, designed to measure the change in results on a change in the assumptions used for the growth rate, including changes in the other parameters contributing to formation of the WACC, would result in better impairment results. In any case, management has verified the reasonableness of its assumptions and the outcome of the impairment test by analysing its sensitivity to the growth rate, with positive results. F-298 ----- The table shows the detailed growth assumptions used in the forecasts and the discount rates applied in the impairment procedures: - Doo Officina-Game East Vrsa operates in the field of mechanical engineering, specialising in the construction of machines for third parties; - I.E.M.A. S.r.l. designs and produces equipment for automated machinery; - LA.CO.

The Group does not have any joint ventures that are individually significant; the Group’s share of the 2017 result of the CMRE Srl joint venture accounted for using the equity method amounts to -65 thousand euros (-68 thousand euros the previous year). At the reporting date, the Group assessed whether there is evidence that the investments in associates and joint ventures have suffered an impairment.

At 31 December 2017, outstanding bonds total 113,268 thousand euros, representing their nominal redemption value of 80 million euros and 42.9 million US dollars. Bonds are made up of: The reduction in debt compared with 31 December 2016 of 49,887 thousand euros is mainly due to the sale of almost 10% of GIMA TT, which took place when it was listed on the Stock Exchange, giving proceeds of 102,457 thousand euros, less the cost of purchasing the Maisa, Mapster and Eurosicma businesses and the exercise of the Medtech option for a total of 31,604 thousand euros, the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in ATOP for a total of 15,969 thousand euros and the dividends distributed by the Parent Company (62,807 thousand euros paid in May 2017).

Application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts shown in the financial statements, namely the statement of financial position, income statement and statement of cash flows, as well as the explanatory notes. Another risk factor is how the Covid-19 pandemic will evolve as its impact on the economy will depend, essentially, on how its intensity changes, how effective the containment measures are and the extent to which people accept having to adjust their behaviour. All matters that are still hard to predict. Despite the current scenario, the periodic financial information has been prepared on a going-concern basis, as there are no significant doubts or uncertainties about the ability to continue in business for the foreseeable future. The financial statement items that require more subjectivity on the part of the directors in preparing estimates, even more so in the conditions explained above, and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions used can have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements are: - goodwill and other intangible assets: no impairment indicators have been identified, as reported in Note 3; - deferred tax assets; F-28 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

When the Group acts as a lessee, at the effective date it recognises an asset consisting of the right of use and a lease liability. _Right-of-Use Assets_ Right-of-use assets are recognised at cost and include the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, the payments due for the lease made on or before the effective date, net of lease _incentives received, the initial direct costs incurred and, if applicable, dismantling costs._ Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis for the lower of the lease term and the estimated useful life. If, at the end of the lease term, the property is transferred to the lessee or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects the fact that the lessee will exercise the purchase option, the depreciation period corresponds to the useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as explained in the section entitled “Impairment of assets”. _Lease liabilities_ Lease liabilities are recognised at the present value of payments due over the life of the lease not paid at the start date, and include fixed payments net of any lease incentives to be received, variable payments due for the lease which depend on a index or rate, the amounts that the lessee is expected to pay as guarantees of the residual value, the exercise price of the purchase option, if it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise the option, and any penalty payments for termination of the lease if the duration of the lease takes into account the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease. The lease payments are estimated using the implicit interest rate of the lease, if this can be easily determined. If this is not possible, the incremental borrowing rate is used, i.e. the interest rate that would have to be paid for a loan, with a similar duration and guarantees, needed to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic context. The marginal financing rates applied were determined on the basis of the geographical area in which the contracts were stipulated and according to the maturity band to which the contracts belong. The value of lease liabilities is increased to take interest into account and is decreased to take payments made into account. In addition, the carrying amount of the lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a change in the lease duration, a change in the valuation of a purchase option for the underlying asset, a change in future payments due for the lease deriving from a change in the index or rate used to determine payments. The Group has included any extension periods covered by the renewal option in the duration of the contract, when it is assumed with reasonable certainty that it will be exercised, also in consideration of the experience acquired. A condition for renewal of the term is also that the Group can exercise the option without the consent of the counterparty or that the lessor is exposed to a significant penalty in case of termination of the contract. The contracts that may envisage a renewal option refer mainly to property leases. F-74 ----- Finance lease contracts are accounted for in accordance with IAS 17. This provides that: - the cost of the leased assets is recognized under property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful life; the financial liability to the lessor is recognized for an amount equal to the value of the leased asset; - the recognition of lease instalments separates the interest element from the principal, which is deemed to represent repayment of the liability to the lessor. Lease contracts under which the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases, and the related instalments are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract.

These assets are recognized at their purchase or production cost. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised each year on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: - Industrial patents and intellectual property rights 3-15 years - Software, licences and similar rights 5-15 years - Trademarks 10-20 years - Development costs 5-15 years Assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for possible impairment of value on an annual basis, or more frequently if evidence suggests an impairment has occurred. When accounting for the sale of intangible assets, the date on which the buyer obtains control of the asset is considered the disposal date, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 to determine when a performance obligation is satisfied. Furthermore, the amount of the consideration included in the profit or loss deriving from derecognition of these assets is determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 for determining the transaction price. Research costs are charged to the income statement as soon as they are incurred. Development costs that qualify for capitalization as assets under IAS 38 (in relation to their technical feasibility, the intention and ability of the enterprise to complete, use or sell the assets, the availability of the resources required for the completion of the development project and the ability to measure the expenditure reliably) are generally amortised in relation to their future economic utility. Amortisation begins from the moment the products become available for economic use. The estimate of useful life is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes in projected future utility. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s share of the net fair value of those purchased assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that can be identified individually and recognized separately. Goodwill is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is not amortised. It is allocated to the related cash-generating units (CGUs) and, pursuant to IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), undergoes impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changed circumstances indicate a probable impairment of value. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is recognized at acquisition price net of any accumulated impairment.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,2532,FINANCIAL ASSETS,2532.1,,2532.1.1,,"At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are classified according to the subsequent methods of measurement, i.e. at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). The classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the business model that the Group uses for their management. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially assesses a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction costs, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, are valued at the transaction price determined according to IFRS 15, as commented on in the section entitled “Revenue from contracts with customers”. For a financial asset to be classified and valued at amortised cost or at FVOCI, it must generate cash flows that depend only on the principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid (so-called “Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or SPPI”). This assessment is referred to as an SPPI test and is performed at instrument level. For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into four categories: _Financial assets at amortised cost_ The Group evaluates financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is owned within the framework of a business model whose objective is to own financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide for cash flows at certain dates represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Profits and losses are recognized in the income statement when the asset is eliminated, modified or revalued. _Financial assets at fair value through OCI_ The Group measures assets from debt instruments at FVOCI if both the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is owned within the framework of a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial assets, and - the contractual terms of the financial asset provide for cash flows at certain dates represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid. For financial assets measured at fair value through OCI, interest income, changes for exchange differences and impairment losses, together with write-backs, are recognized through profit or loss and calculated in the same way as financial assets measured at amortised cost. Other changes in fair value are recognized in OCI. At the time of elimination, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income statement.

The Group mainly uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exchange rate and interest rate risk. The Group does not hold any speculative financial instruments, in accordance with the procedure approved by the Executive Committee. At the start of a hedging transaction, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationship, to which it intends to apply hedge accounting, its own risk management objectives and the strategy pursued. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk and the ways in which the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the effectiveness requirements of the hedge (including an analysis of the sources of ineffectiveness of the hedge and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship meets the eligibility criteria for hedge accounting if it meets the following requirements: - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; - the effect of credit risk does not prevail over the changes in value resulting from the economic relationship; - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the amount of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge this quantity of hedged item. The portion of profit or loss on the hedged instrument, relating to the effective hedging portion, is recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income in the fair value reserve, while the ineffective portion is recognized directly in the income statement. When the underlying element being hedged becomes manifest, the fair value reserve is reversed to the income statement and attributed to the carrying value of the underlying.

The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined by their market value at the date of designation when it refers to hedging instruments of future cash flows. This is recognized in the fair value reserve in equity and reversed to income when the event associated with the underlying financial expense/ income occurs. Changes in the fair value of instruments that do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement as financial income/expense. F-175 ----- The fundamental characteristics of financial instruments are described in the preceding section with regard to financial assets and in the section “Borrowings” with regard to financial liabilities. The Group mainly uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exchange rate and interest rate risk. The Group does not hold any speculative financial instruments, in accordance with the procedure approved by the Executive Committee. The Group has opted to account for financial instruments under the hedge accounting rules when: - at the inception of the operation, the instrument is formally designated as a hedge and the hedging relationship is documented; - the hedge is expected to be highly effective; - the effectiveness can be reliably measured and the hedge itself remains highly effective throughout the designated periods. The Group recognizes cash flow hedges when it is formally documented that they hedge fluctuations in the cash flows deriving from an asset, liability or highly probable forecast transaction (the hedged underlying) that could affect the income statement. Hedging instruments are measured at their fair value at the reporting date as estimated by independent third parties. The fair value of foreign exchange derivatives used to hedge future cash flow is calculated in relation to their intrinsic value and their time value; the intrinsic element is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, whereas the time element is booked directly to income as financial income or expense. When the underlying element being hedged becomes manifest, the fair value reserve is reversed to the income statement and attributed to the carrying value of the underlying. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined by their market value at the date of designation when it refers to hedging instruments of future cash flows. This is recognized in the fair value reserve in equity and reversed to income when the event associated with the underlying financial charge/ income occurs.

Receivables sold without recourse are derecognized from the balance sheet if substantially all of the related risks and rewards have been transferred to the purchaser. With regard to impairment, the IAS 39 model based on incurred losses was replaced in 2018 by the expected credit loss (ECL) model, as provided for in IFRS 9. The model assumes a significant level of estimation regarding the impact of changes in economic factors on ECL which are weighted according to probabilities. The impairment loss model is applied to financial assets valued at amortised cost or at FVOCI, except for equity instruments and assets deriving from contracts with customers. Credit hedging funds are measured using the following methodological approaches: the General deterioration method and the Simplified approach; in particular: - the General Deterioration Method requires the classification of financial instruments included in the scope of application of IFRS 9 into three stages. The three stages reflect the level of deterioration in credit quality when the financial instrument is acquired and involve a different method of calculating the ECL; - the Simplified Approach envisages, for trade receivables, contract assets and receivables deriving from lease contracts, the adoption of some simplifications, in order to avoid entities being forced to monitor changes in credit risk, as required by the General Model. Recognition of the impairment according to the simplified approach should be lifetime, so stage allocation is not required. One of the operational examples falling within the simplified approaches for the estimation of ECLs is that of the Provision Matrix, particularly suitable, in terms of its construction, for assessing trade receivables from a particularly fractioned clientele but which offers the possibility of being categorised in the same risk classes. In fact, different impairment rates are determined in the provision matrix, making it possible to group together in the proposed matrix, first of all the receivables based on the days’ delay in payment of the trade receivables. In addition to this aggregation variable, impairment rates are estimated by customer classes that show the same loss path. The standard does not lay down a single principle for customer segmentation, leaving each entity free to select the sample sub-sets in order to make them consistent, based on individual experiences. According to the individual customer base, therefore, each entity organises the provision matrix by dividing customers into clusters using different factors and variables such as geographical area, product area and credit rating. As anticipated above, when the General Deterioration Method is applied, financial instruments are classified into three stages according to the deterioration of their credit quality between the date of initial recognition and the measurement date: - Stage 1 – for activities that have not undergone a significant increase in credit risk with respect to those recorded at the time of initial recognition or if they have a low credit risk on the reference F-78 ----- Receivables falling due beyond a period considered normal commercial practice and not earning explicit interest are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any related impairment losses. Receivables sold without recourse are derecognized from the balance sheet if substantially all of the related risks and rewards have been transferred to the purchaser. Regarding impairment, the IAS 39 model based on losses suffered has been replaced by the ECL (Expected Credit Loss) model, as provided for by IFRS 9.

The Group’s segment information is divided into the Tea, Food & Other, Pharmaceutical and Tobacco Packaging segments, grouped together by reference markets. **IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED FROM 1 JANUARY 2019** The Group has applied IFRS 16 – Leases from 1 January 2019. This standard, published in January 2016, replaces IAS 17 – Leases, IFRIC 4 – Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 – Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 – Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 defines the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases on the balance sheet on the basis of a single model similar to the one used to account for finance leases under IAS 17. The Group has applied the standard by adopting the simplified retrospective method, assessing, for leases previously classified as operating leases, the lease liability at the current value of the residual payments due, discounted using the lessee’s marginal financing rate on the date of the initial application, and recognising the asset consisting of the right of use for an amount equal to that of the liability. There are therefore no cumulative effects to adjust the opening balance of the equity and the figures for the comparative period have not been restated. In particular, the net assets recorded at the date of FTA amounted to 141,091 thousand euros (property, plant and equipment of 141,712 thousand euros, net of deferred costs of 621 thousand euros) and lease liabilities of 141,091 thousand euros. For leases previously classified as finance leases, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of first-time adoption is the carrying amount of the leased asset and the lease liability measured immediately before this date by applying IAS 17. Furthermore, the Group has used the right not to re-examine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease on the date of first application. In these consolidated financial statements, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are shown in the statement of financial position under Right-of-use assets and Lease liabilities, respectively. Details of the rights of use assets and of the lease liabilities are provided in Notes 2 and 15. In the statement of cash flows, repayment of the principal and interest on the financial liability is shown as part of the cash flows of the financing activity. The lease contracts entered into by the Group are essentially attributable to real estate and car leases. Non-lease components were not included in determining the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Group included in the duration of the contract any extension periods covered by the renewal option, when assumed with reasonable certainty that it will be exercised, also based on past experience, and took advantage of the option to exclude short-term contracts (including leases with a duration that ends within 12 months from the date of initial application) from the scope of application of the standard and contracts in which the underlying asset is of low value.

IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and introduced a new model for the recognition of revenue deriving from contracts with customers on the basis of the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract with the customer; (ii) identification of performance obligations to be transferred to the customer in exchange for the consideration; (iii) identification of the contractual consideration; (iv) allocation of the consideration to the individual performance obligations; (v) recognition of revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The accounting standards in force up to 31 December 2017 provided for recognition of revenue to the extent that it was probable that the economic benefits would be achieved and the amount involved could be determined reliably and the revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or due.

The changes in the breakdown of revenue by geographical area are discussed below: - revenue from European Union countries, excluding Italy, is growing in Spain, France, Ireland and Slovenia; - sales in other European countries are slightly decreasing compared with the previous year, especially in Russia; - North America is growing significantly in a context essentially without significant local competition; - in Asia and the Middle East there was a slight decrease of 5.6%, but this confirms the importance of this market, which regularly accounts for more than 20% of Group sales. The progress in local economies is generating an improvement in production standards closer to those of the West and as a consequence a demand for machinery more in line with what we can offer. In particular, there has been growth in China and a decrease in Japan; - revenue from other countries reflects a variety of trends with growth in Brazil, Mexico, Algeria and Morocco; - the growth in Italy was due to the higher number of projects with respect to the prior year. These fluctuations recur annually since revenue depends on the level of investment projects of the pharmaceutical companies, which is inevitably unstable in a market like Italy.

As required by IFRS 16, this contract led to the recognition of ROUs for 13,473 thousand euros in 2019. The other assets are essentially cars and assets under construction are mainly attributable to CMRE S.r.l.’s building complex under construction in Ozzano dell’Emilia (BO). As regards the accounting impact of FTA of IFRS 16, please refer to the comments in the section entitled “Implementation of accounting standards”. It should be noted that in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018, property, plant and equipment included the contractual value of assets held under finance leases and presented in accordance with IAS 17, which was in force until 31 December 2018. From 1 January 2019, the balances outstanding at 31 December 2018 of 12,452 thousand euros were reclassified to assets for rights of use, in accordance with IFRS 16. In addition, 29,222 thousand euros of leasehold improvements have been reclassified. For further information on lease liabilities, see Note 15. In the income statement for 2019, the FTA of IFRS 16 led to the elimination of operating lease payments for 23,170 thousand euros and recognition of depreciation on the right-of-use assets and interest expense on the lease liabilities, as reported below: in thousands of euros 2019 Depreciation of right of use assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21,024 Short-term or low-value lease fees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,591 Interest expense on lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,208",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Transworld Packaging Holding S.p.A. controls thirteen companies, either directly or indirectly. For further information, see the list of equity investments provided in section H of the explanatory notes. At 31 December 2017, non-controlling interests amount to 21,309 thousand euros (14,647 thousand euros at 31 December 2016) and principally relate to GIMA TT S.p.A., 17,808 thousand euros and the Ilapak Group, 2,931 thousand euros. The dividends paid to minority shareholders in 2017 amounted to 10,583 thousand euros and refer for 8,100 thousand euros to GIMA TT S.p.A. (7,537 thousand euros in 2016, of which 6,032 thousand euros attributable to GIMA TT S.p.A.). In 2017, GIMA TT S.p.A., a subsidiary of the Parent Company that produces automatic packaging machines in the tobacco sector, was listed on the MTA, as commented on in the “Scope of consolidation” section. This reduced its shareholding from 70% to 60.084, without resulting in a loss of control over GIMA TT by the Group; therefore, the effect of the above transactions has increased equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company by 99,169 million euros, in compliance with international accounting standards.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,2580,30. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,2580.1,,2580.1.1,,"On 4 February 2019, Transworld Packaging Holding S.p.A. acquired 100% of the Swiss company Luna Investment SA, based in Lugano with share capital of 100 thousand CHF, for a total of 2,033 thousand euros. The company has as its object to purchase, hold, manage and sell equity investments. The goodwill recognized provisionally amounts to approximately 2,069 thousand euros. On 11 April 2019, IMA completed the closing of the acquisition of 61.45% of Tecmar S.A., based in Mar del Plata (Argentina), an important player in the South American market in the design, production and marketing of automatic packaging machines in the coffee and food sectors. IMA has also signed put & call options on the other 38.55%, to be exercised after the approval of the financial statements at 31 December 2023. F-137 ----- On 5 April 2018, IMA, through its subsidiary GIMA S.p.A., exercised the option to purchase a further 31% of Petroncini Impianti S.p.A., with operations based in Sant’Agostino (FE), which is market leader in machinery for the production of coffee, thereby bringing its overall interest in the company to 80%. GIMA SpA already held 49% of the investment, acquired in 2016 for 2,000 thousand euros, whose carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 applying the equity method was equal to 1,969 thousand euros. Petroncini Impianti S.p.A. controls Petroncini International Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. (100%). The acquisition cost of this 31% was equal to 8,600 thousand euros, fully paid at the closing. As required by IFRS 3, if a business combination is carried out in several phases, the interest held previously is remeasured at the fair value on the date of acquisition of control and the difference compared with the value of the previously held investment is recognized in the income statement; the income related to the acquisition of Petroncini Impianti SpA determined in this way was 11,625 thousand euros.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS,2583.1,,2583.1.1,,"In compliance with current Consob regulations on Related-Party Transactions, from 2010 IMA S.p.A. adopted the procedure to be followed by IMA and its subsidiaries when carrying out transactions with parties related to IMA; this procedure was updated on 15 February 2019. For further information please read the Report on operations. At 31 December 2019 the share capital of IMA S.p.A. was held 51.594% by SO.FI.M.A. Following the total asymmetric spin-off of Lopam Fin S.p.A., the former parent company of SO.FI.M.A., which took place on 16 July 2019, and its consequent cancellation from the register of companies, the entity at the highest hierarchical level that holds control of IMA S.p.A. at 31 December 2019 is SO.FI.M.A. The following companies form part of the domestic tax group: IMA S.p.A., CO.MA.DI.S. S.p.A., Corazza S.p.A., Packaging Manufacturing Industry S.r.l. and Revisioni Industriali S.r.l. as consolidated companies and SO.FI.M.A. as the consolidating company. As described earlier, intra-group transactions are a consequence of the organizational structure of the Group. Such transactions are carried out as part of ordinary operations on an arm’s-length basis. In addition to intra-group transactions, the Group also conducts operations with other related parties, mainly parties controlling the Parent Company, or parties responsible for the administration and management of IMA S.p.A. or entities controlled by such parties.

The processes and methodologies applied to evaluate and determine the recoverable amount of each CGU, in terms of value in use, are based on complex assumptions that, due to their nature, imply the use of management’s judgment, in particular with reference to the forecasted cash flows for the period 2019-2021, the normalized cash flows used to estimate terminal value and the discount and longterm growth rates applied.

Such revenues and margins from contract work are recognized on the stage-of-completion basis applying the “cost-to-cost method”, which is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred for work performed to date on the estimated total costs to complete the contract. The procedures and application for revenue recognition, and for the valuation of contract assets and liabilities of contract work, are based on complex assumptions that, due to their nature, imply the use of management’s judgment, in particular with reference to the estimated costs to complete each project and changes in estimates compared to the previous year, if any. Such changes could be influenced by multiple factors such as, for example, the timeframe required to develop and complete the projects, the high technological and innovative content, the possible presence of price variances and price adjustments, and the performance guarantees of the machines, including the estimation of contractual risks, if any. Considering the economic and financial significance of contract work and the complexity of the assumptions used in forecasting total costs of the contracts, in addition to the potential impact of the changes in estimates, we considered that this item represents a key audit matter.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group’s audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. F-258 ----- We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We have provided those charged with governance with a statement that we complied with the ethical and independence requirements applicable in Italy, and we have communicated to them all circumstances that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determined those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We have described these matters in our auditor’s report. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: - we identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - we obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - we evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; - we concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

The classification of financial assets on initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and the business model that the Group uses to manage them. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value, plus transaction costs in the case of a financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are valued at the price of the transaction determined in accordance with IFRS 15, as commented in paragraph “Revenue from contracts with customers”. For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, it must generate cash flows that depend only on the principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid (so-called “solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)”). This measurement is referred to as an SPPI test and is carried out on the individual instrument. For the purposes of subsequent valuation, financial assets are classified into four categories: _Financial assets at amortised cost_ The Group evaluates financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following requirements are met: - the financial asset is held within the framework of a business model the objective of which is the possession of financial assets aimed at collecting contractual financial flows and - the contractual terms of the financial asset envisage cash flows on certain dates represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment testing. Profits and losses are recognized in the income statement when the asset is eliminated, modified or revalued. _Financial assets at fair value through OCI_ The Group assesses the assets from debt instruments at fair value recorded in the comprehensive income statement if both of the following conditions are satisfied: - the financial asset is held within the framework of a business model, whose objective is achieved through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial assets, and - the contractual terms of the financial asset include cash flows on certain dates, represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid. For financial assets measured at fair value through OCI, interest income, changes for exchange differences and impairment losses, together with write-backs, are recognized through profit or loss and calculated in the same way as financial assets measured at amortised cost. Rest of changes in fair value are recognized in OCI. On elimination, the cumulative change in fair value recorded in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss. _Investments in equity instruments_ On initial recognition, the Group can irrevocably choose to classify its equity investments as equity instruments valued at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity instruments pursuant to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. Each instrument is classified individually. The profits and losses on these financial assets are never booked to the income statement. Dividends are recognized as other revenue in the income statement when the right to payment has been F-174 ----- According to IAS 39 financial assets are split into four categories: financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, investments held to maturity, loans and receivables, and financial assets available for sale. The IMA Group holds available-for-sale securities and equity investments in other companies and financial receivables. Financial assets available for sale are measured at fair value and financial receivables are measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost. At 31 December 2017, the Group did not possess financial instruments measured at fair value in the income statement or investments held to maturity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,2595,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET IN FORCE,2595.4,,2595.4.1,,"The Group is assessing the impact of the amendments to accounting standards that have been issued but not yet in force. In particular, IFRS 16 Leases was published in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 defines the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases on the balance sheet on the basis of a single model similar to the one used to account for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard will come into force for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group will apply the new standard from the obligatory effective date. The Group has carried out an analysis of the potential impact that adoption of the new standard could have on the balance sheet, financial position, income statement and disclosures made in the notes. The quantitative effects of the estimate could be subject to further changes during 2019 as the Group is currently finalising the analysis. The Group will apply the standard by adopting the simplified retrospective method, assessing, for leases previously classified as operating leases, the lease liability at the current value of the residual payments due, discounted using the lessee’s marginal financing rate on the date of the initial application, and recognizing the asset consisting of the right of use for an amount equal to that of the liability. Therefore, there are no cumulative effects to adjust the opening balance of the equity. Furthermore, the 2018 financial statements will not be restated for comparative purposes. The lease contracts entered into by the Group are essentially attributable to real estate and car leases. The Group did not consider the non-leasing components. It included in the duration of the contract any extension periods covered by the renewal option, when assumed with reasonable certainty that it will be exercised, also based on past experience, and took advantage of the option to exclude short-term contracts (including leases with a duration that ends within 12 months from the date of initial application) from the scope of application of the standard and contracts in which the underlying asset is of low value. The Group has estimated that, at the date of first application, the lease liability amounts to approximately 141,043 thousand euros. As mentioned in Note 32 Commitments, at 31 December 2018 the Group had commitments for property rentals relating to industrial facilities, warehouses and offices for a total of 132,641 thousand euros and future minimum payments for non-cancellable operating leases for a total of 4,811 thousand euros. Lease instalments paid during the year for operating lease contracts and rents amounted to 21,187 thousand euros.

143_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,2617,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTRACT WORK,2617.1,,2617.1.1,,"Contract work is defined in IAS 11 (“Construction Contracts”) as a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an asset or a group of interrelated assets, having regard for their design, technology, function or final use. Contract costs are recognized in the year they are incurred. Contract revenue is recognized on a stage-of-completion basis at the reporting date, if the outcome of the construction contract can be estimated reliably. If the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent of the contract costs incurred that are likely to be recovered. Expected losses on a construction contract are recognized as an expense as soon as it becomes probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue. Revenue from contract work is recognized on a stage-of-completion basis applying the “cost-to-cost” method, which involves establishing the proportion of costs incurred on work performed to date with respect to the estimated total costs of the contract. The valuation reflects the best estimate of the project costs at the balance sheet date. Directors base their estimates on the information generated by the internal system of reporting, forecasting and accounting for the contract; they also examine and, where necessary, revise their estimates of revenues and costs at the various stages of completion of the contract. Any economic effects are recognized in the period that the updates are made. To provide better support for management’s estimates, the Group has set up contract risk management and analysis tools, designed to identify, monitor and quantify the risks relating to the performance of such contract work. Contract work is shown net of any provisions for write-downs, losses likely to be incurred to finish the contract and advance payments for contract work in progress. This analysis is carried out contract by contract and their presentation in the statement of financial position is as follows: - the amount due from customers is classified among Trade receivables if the costs incurred plus recognized margins (less recognized losses) exceed the advances received; - the amount due to customers is classified among Advances if the advances received exceed the costs incurred plus recognized margins (less recognized losses).",N/A,as_expected,2021,770

Receivables falling due beyond a period considered normal commercial practice and not earning explicit interest are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any related impairment losses.

In view of the strategic nature of these acquisitions for the IMA Group, these equity investments have been classified as financial assets available for sale and changes in their fair value are recognized in equity.

The change of the year, amounting to 364 thousand euros, reflects impairment adjustment recognised under financial charges.
