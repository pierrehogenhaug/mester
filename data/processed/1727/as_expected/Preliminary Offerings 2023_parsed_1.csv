For the financial year ending December 31, 2023, we reconsidered our definition of Net Debt and decided to no longer include amortized costs as part of Net Debt. Accordingly, in this Offering Memorandum, we define Net Debt as ""Gross debt (representing long- and short-term borrowings (excluding amortized costs) and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives and financial guarantee contracts) less cash and cash equivalents."" We believe the revised definition of Net Debt provides investors with more useful information and we intend to continue to present Net Debt in accordance with this revised definition going forward. We have applied our revised definition of Net Debt throughout this Offering Memorandum for each of the periods presented, and as a result, the amount of Net Debt presented herein does not reconcile to the amounts presented in the Annual Financial Statements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,54,IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM,54.8,Non-IFRS Measures,54.8.2,,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions), Cash Conversion, Free Cash Flow, Gross Capital Expenditure, Gross Debt, Net Debt, Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Cash Flow, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Reported EBITDA, Reported EBITDA Margin and Reported Free Cash Flow, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS (the ""Non-IFRS Measures""). For reconciliations of the Non-IFRS Measures to the nearest IFRS measures, see ""Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information"" and ""Management's Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures,"" ""—Free Cash Flow,"" and ""—Net Debt.""_ ----- The Non-IFRS Measures are used by our management to assess operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS standards or other generally accepted accounting principles. The Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit from ordinary operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The Non-IFRS Measures include figures derived from the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, the Annual Financial Statements and accounting records through aggregation, subtraction or division, but the Non-IFRS Measures have neither been audited nor reviewed. We define these Non-IFRS Measures as follows: - **_Adjusted EBITDA_** represents our Reported EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off items described in ""Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As _Adjusted Financial Information"";_ - **_Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage; - **_Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions)_** represents purchases of property, plant and equipment plus purchases of intangible assets shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows; - **_Cash Conversion represents Operating Cash Flow divided by Reported EBITDA; - **_Free Cash Flow represents_** our Operating Cash Flow less Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and the carrying amount of sold property, plant and equipment; - **_Gross Capital Expenditure represents our Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) plus acquisitions shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows; - **_Gross Debt_** represents our long- and short-term borrowings (excluding amortized costs) and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives and financial guarantee contracts), see also ""—Net Debt"" below; - **_Net Debt represents our Gross Debt less cash and cash equivalents, see also ""—Net Debt"" below; - **_Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA represents Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA; - **_Operating Cash Flow represents_** our Reported EBITDA adjusted for changes in net working capital and operating lease payments; - **_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents our Adjusted EBITDA, after giving pro forma effect to the expected EBITDA impact of completed acquisitions in the first six months of 2023 described in ""Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As _Adjusted Financial Information"";_ - **_Reported EBITDA represents profit for the year/period before depreciation and amortization expense, financial income, financial expense, share of profit of joint venture, income tax expense and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses represents the impairment of our investment in Fortrent in the year ended December 31, 2022; - **_Reported EBITDA Margin represents Reported EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage; and - **_Reported Free Cash Flow represents_** our Reported EBITDA adjusted for the carrying amount of sold property, plant and equipment, less Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions). These Non-IFRS Measures may be defined differently from the corresponding terms under the Indenture and have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of their limitations are the following: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; ----- - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and the relevant Non-IFRS Measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required to make such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our audited financial information and by using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading rental equipment specialist in Europe. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, with strong market positions across our main markets, including the largest market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden and the second largest market share in each of Germany and Finland, in each case in terms of revenue in 2022. Our family-owned business started out of four garage boxes in the 1970s, and, under five decades later, has expanded into an industry leader with an extensive network of 759 depots in 18 European countries and a fleet of approximately 860,000 rental units as at June 30, 2023. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €1,524.9 million in revenue and €540.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA. We serve customers in a variety of end-markets from civil engineering, industrial, construction and infrastructure to events and warehousing. Our core product offering includes general and specialist rental equipment alongside complementary products and services, enabling us to be a one-stop-shop for our customer base of both corporate clients (business-to-business) and individuals including craftsmen and retail clients (business-to-consumer). Our generalist division is mainly focused on the less cyclical 'fit-out, maintain and operate' market segments which use lighter equipment, while our specialist division is tailored to reach niche markets, such as site preparation, sanitation and access control. With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe, for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer ""do-it-yourself"" (""DIY"") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training courses, project management and emergency assistance. In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions: - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; and - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue (representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8 ""Operating Segments"" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see ""Presentation of _Financial Information—Operating Segments.""_ ----- We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group, is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020. We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements. Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996, we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs. The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers' industries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Leading market positions in a large and growing European market supported by favorable underlying growth drivers,"We have grown significantly since our founding in 1977 as a local rental company. Since then, we have grown into a multinational company through a combination of organic growth and transformative and bolt-on acquisitions. With the Cramo acquisition in 2020, which allowed us to expand our operations in the Nordics and Baltics while strengthening our network in Western and Central Europe, we have created a true pan-European rental equipment player with increased scale and resilience. We believe that our current footprint provides us with beneficial scale in strong and growing geographic and customer end-markets. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental business in Europe by rental revenue in 2022. As of June 30, 2023, we operate a comprehensive depot network of 759 depots, comprising 681 general rental depots and 78 specialist rental depots. We believe that our scale is particularly important as a provider of rental equipment, because it helps us optimize fleet utilization rates through our ability to easily relocate units to areas with higher demand for specific types of equipment and provides us with additional bargaining power in negotiations with OEMs and equipment suppliers and maintenance partners. We believe that our scale and our market leadership also help to increase our brand recognition and affords us with greater opportunities to attract and retain talented and experienced personnel. In the Netherlands, which is historically our cornerstone market, we believe that we hold a strong leader position with between 25% and 30% of market share based on revenue in 2022, which we believe is significantly ahead of our competitors. We believe we are also the leader in Belgium with approximately 10% of market share and the second-largest player in Germany with between 5% and 10% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. With the acquisition of Cramo in 2020, we expanded our presence into five more European markets (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania) and significantly strengthened our position in six European countries where Boels and Cramo had a joint presence. We believe that we are the second largest player in Sweden, with close to 20% of market share, and in Finland, with more than 15% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. ----- We believe that the markets we address are strong and poised for further growth. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the total market size of the top 15 European rental equipment markets is estimated to have increased by 4% from €24.7 billion in 2021 to €25.7 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow by 3.3% in 2023 and 5.6% in 2024. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the European market is expected to remain strong, driven by an increased rental penetration and a structural shift in customers' preferences towards renting rather than owning equipment. This shift is supported by the attractiveness and flexibility offered by renting, as it optimizes the split between operating costs and capital expenditures by reducing the fixed portion of maintenance and fleet replacement costs and allows customers to avoid investing in expensive equipment that may not be used frequently. Moreover, the transition to achieving net zero CO2 emissions amplifies this effect, as electric equipment is generally more expensive. This structural shift is expected to support continued demand for rental equipment companies' products and services over the medium and long term. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from growth and positive trends in the equipment rental industry. The European rental equipment industry is still highly fragmented, consisting of a large number of small companies serving local or regional markets, with a limited number of medium to larger companies serving regional, national and international customers. We believe we are one of only a few companies with a strong pan-European platform, with strong relationships with the key equipment OEMs. We compete with a large number of smaller competitors locally and a few larger international competitors. We believe that we are well-positioned for growth by leveraging our scale and footprint, while relying on our proven approach of customizing our strategy for each local market, while centralizing our key operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,"Resilient business model supported by robust diversification across geographies, end markets, products and customers, supported by a notable depot network","We strive to minimize the impact of economic cycles through continually maximizing our rental fleet utilization rate, developing specialist activities focused on non-construction related niche markets, diversifying our customer base by investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction related customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction projects. We have a diversified footprint and address several different customer end-markets, helping to mitigate our exposure to macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, with the acquisition of Cramo, we significantly increased our geographical diversification, bringing our revenue generated in the Netherlands to 24% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, compared to nearly half of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Moreover, no single country represented more than 25% of our revenue generation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We believe that this enhanced geographic diversification gives us greater resilience during periods of slow economic growth, as different countries operate within different economic cycles. Based on our revenue and EBITDA growth, we believe we outperformed our largest European competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving the resilience of our business model. The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We address multiple customer end markets, which also contributes to our resilience in reducing the impact of volatility of external factors such as market conditions and macroeconomic developments. We have positioned ourselves as a leading generalist equipment rental company that is also active in the attractive specialist sub-segment and in DIY, with specialist rental and DIY representing 28% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 54% of our sales were derived from non-construction end-markets, indicating a relatively modest exposure to the cyclical construction market. Furthermore, our exposure to the construction end market includes a large part of less cyclical phases of construction activities, such as the fit out, maintenance and operational phases. The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by end markets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. ----- Over time, we have continued developing our expertise in specialist rental equipment, focusing on nonconstruction related end-markets, such as site preparation, modular space, measurement, testing and safety, sanitation, portable kitchen, hoisting and lifting, access control, and industrial rental and pumps. We believe our specialized knowledge is key to our ability to service different niche markets, providing further resilience and less exposure to the more cyclical construction market. By leveraging our generalist rental equipment business, we also aim to provide the best and most comprehensive rental solutions for our customers with the objective of cross-selling our specialist equipment to fuel future growth. Ultimately, our specialist business represents a key peer differentiator with customers, which we believe provides for higher returns. In parallel, we also operate in the niche market of DIY rental, with more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops as at June 30, 2023, where customers at DIY retail stores have access to primarily smaller equipment rental such as tools. This type of business is less cyclical than traditional equipment rental market and the costs to operate this business are typically lower than other equipment rental businesses due to the strong operational leverage of the existing rental depot network. In the DIY market, we are able to offer convenience as a differentiating factor to our customers, generating higher customer foot traffic in the stores, at a time when e-commerce is putting a strain on retailers and brick-and-mortar stores. We strive to offer a wide range of equipment and tools across all the phases of construction projects, including the build (both heavy construction and fit out), operate and maintain phases. Our business model also hinges on providing a diversified range of products to our customers. We particularly focus on smaller equipment rentals, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, which represented approximately 48% of our rental revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. These rentals position us within the less-cyclical 'fit out', 'maintain' and 'operate' phases of the asset cycle, as demand for such rentals is typically more resilient and makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects. For example, smaller equipment rentals tend to be more sought after for renovation and maintenance use, which are inherently less exposed to cyclical demand than other end uses. As of June 30, 2023, with a fleet of approximately 860,000 equipment units, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment, in addition to value-added services such as logistics, we aim to provide full turnkey solutions to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner. Furthermore, with a comprehensive network of 759 depots (strategically located within a 50-kilometer reach of our key customers and project sites across Europe) and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30, 2023, we are capable of mobilizing our rental fleet even in remote places for any customer or user at the right time, through multiple delivery methods: pick up and return or delivery to desired locations. By constantly adapting our network to changes and fluctuations in the market, we have the strategic ability to open or close access points near our customers. Based on market trends or developments in specific regions in Europe, we can adapt swiftly and embrace changes in our industry. Our hub-and-spoke networking model provides a diversified customer reach and develops efficiency and flexibility in our operations, ensuring that we are close to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return or project delivery. This proximity to our customers results in shorter transport times, lower costs and lower CO2 emissions. Supported by our broad product offering and dense network, we also benefit from a large and diversified customer base, serving numerous customers of different sizes and from different sectors through our various channels (both generalist and specialist rental products) ranging from DIY customers, cash customers and craftsmen to large industrial, services and construction companies, potentially operating in different economic cycles. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 7.4% of our revenue, with no single customer representing more than 2% of our revenue. We benefit from strong customer loyalty, evidenced by the fact that our 10 largest customers by revenue have, on average, an approximately 20-year relationship with us. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust fleet management and digital capabilities,"We differentiate our offering from most of our peers by focusing on smaller rental items, such as tools and access equipment, in addition to construction equipment and containers. The chart below shows our revenue breakdown by product category for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Over the last five years, we have invested more than €1.4 billion to renew our rental fleet, with €448 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a young, well-invested fleet with a historical purchase value of approximately €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023. These investments have reduced the weighted average age of our fleet to 53 months as of June 30, 2023, allowing us to offer our customers the latest advanced equipment and sufficient headroom to reduce or delay our capital expenditures during economic downturns. The chart below shows our rental equipment fleet's average useful life and its age (in months), by product category, as of June 30, 2023. Our tools product category, which amounted to 16% of our rental sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, has the lowest spread between average useful life and average fleet age in our fleet, with an average of approximately 3.5 years of use remaining before ultimately needing to be replaced. Our smaller equipment, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, and other small tools, are characterized by superior unit economics compared to our other product categories, as they lead to higher money utilization rates (defined as our twelve-month fleet sales divided by the historical purchase price, based on the weighted average price by number of rental units). For the year ended December 31, 2022, our money utilization rate for the tools and light equipment product category was higher than our larger product categories, such as construction equipment, which we believe results in an increase in our return on fleet investments and an increase in our resilience through business cycles, given our high exposure to the tools and light equipment category. The chart below shows our money utilization rate for our different types of rental equipment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. ----- Our focus on tools and access equipment makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects and more exposed to the less cyclical renovation market, where we have a better pricing power among our smaller customers. On our major long-term projects, we often provide a full range of equipment from small hand-held tools to larger equipment, reflecting our ability to support our clients on their various steps and needs with adequate and available equipment. This ability to provide full range of equipment in due time ultimately fosters relationships with our clients, creating recurring revenue streams and the potential for cross-selling between our generalist and specialist equipment. We have developed a robust asset management strategy for our extensive fleet. Our fleet management strategy covers the entire lifecycle of our equipment units, which includes purchasing, renting, and equipment servicing, as well as reselling the equipment at the end of its financial or economic lifetime. When making purchasing decisions, we seek to provide a true one-stop shop experience for our customers by ensuring a high degree of availability across our entire rental range and equipment that is adapted to their needs. By closely monitoring trends, events and market prices, we can quickly adjust and adapt our offer to customers' needs. For example, the share of Eco-labelled equipment in our fleet is relatively high and growing in line with higher market demand for electrical, hybrid or battery-powered equipment and the highest sustainability standards. Simultaneously, we seek time- and cost-efficiency to maximize our economies of scale and fleet occupancy performance. These initiatives improve our fleet availability and utilization rates while minimizing our maintenance capital expenditures. We have implemented an advanced and integrated infrastructure to drive decision making for our fleet, such as enterprise resource planning and specialized hardware and software. This asset management system allows us to track the complete life cycle of any rental asset in our fleet, providing us with visibility on our any given item (such as depot performance, inventory levels, fleet allocation and pricing) and the ability to adjust our fleet investment and pricing. This enables us able to serve our customers according to their needs, quickly and efficiently. In addition, this system makes it possible to limit downtime and improve utilization rates and pricing. Finally, as a piece of our equipment reaches the end of its lifecycle within the Company, we believe that we are able to optimize the timing of its resale and maximize its resale value through closely following secondary market prices and trends and taking third-party insights into account. Our fleet management strategy also relies on a central procurement strategy. This enables us to benefit from economies of scale and allows us to be close to our OEMs and their product development, positioning us at the forefront for the latest products in terms of efficiency, safety and sustainability. In addition, our relationships with OEMs not only allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. We also foster our relationships with our OEMs by collaborating on technological developments and data analyses, and we aim to deepen our cooperation with them further. In addition, we have invested and continue to invest in the latest technology to help us efficiently process our fleet maintenance and repairs and minimize our related costs and administrative workload. These technological capabilities allow us to be in full control of depreciation and replacement strategies and therefore systematically improve our fleet usage, composition and performance. We monitor and reduce the impact machine repairs and maintenance have on lifetime costs and resale value. Finally, we seek to be a leader in innovation and digital transformation across the entire rental process, which we believe results in higher customer satisfaction and percentage of recurring business, better fleet damage control and substantial emissions savings. We were an early adopter of digital offerings in the European rental market, having anticipated this trend by preparing a detailed mapping of our customer experiences per segment, with the aim to simplify online rental in all our customer's life cycle stages and provide a one-stop-shop solution: from becoming a customer to online renting, logistics, usage, having all relevant information available and invoicing. In parallel, this digital transformation generates operational efficiencies by allowing us to optimize our processes such as transport and logistics. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Since our foundation more than 45 years ago, we have been focused on increasing scale and achieving sales growth. Our business model is based on actively distributing our fleet through our depot network, directly competing with local players and ultimately winning market share by providing newer equipment and better customer service. This model has delivered a proven track record of strong growth over the past decade. Between 2012 and 2022, our revenue grew at a CAGR of approximately 19%, significantly exceeding the growth of the economy, the construction market and the equipment rental market over the same period in Europe. While delivering robust sales growth, we have also managed to retain steady and high margins, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

Revenue for 2019 has been prepared solely for illustrative purposes based on management estimates utilizing a simple aggregation of the revenue of Cramo and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have the ability to actively manage our fleet investment based on existing market conditions and the stage of the industry cycle, which has contributed to our counter-cyclical cash generation. In an industry growth cycle, we invest in our rental fleet to enhance our product catalogue and expand into new products and markets. In a downturn, with our newly invested young fleet, we can rapidly reduce our capital expenditures and postpone our investments, streamline our depot network and the size of the fleet, and pay down debt with our strong cash flows resulting from lower capital expenditures. Our business has flexibility to make investment decisions on a regular, short-term basis, and has no long-term expansionary capital expenditures commitments. Therefore, we are generally able to quickly adjust our fleet investments to respond to the changing market environment. For example, recently, we were able to quickly adapt our investments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on maintaining our existing fleet through reduced capital expenditures. After the stabilization of market conditions in 2021, we resumed our investments by increasing our capital expenditures. ----- The countercyclical nature of cash generation and our ability to adjust our capital expenditure while preserving our cash generation through the cycles supports our conservative leverage policy and enables us to deleverage during challenging economic periods, as we did during the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, the double dip recession, and more recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The members of our management are further supported by divisional and regional managers in an organizational structure that empowers entrepreneurship spirit and decision making. Jan Piet Valk, our Chief Financial Officer since 2020 and member of our Management Board, has acquired a proven international experience through his previous chief financial officer positions. He is responsible for the overall financial management, M&A strategy, health and safety policy, legal, treasury, sustainability and real estate matters and is involved in all key decisions in the company. Mr. Valk has recently been awarded ""CFO of the Year"" by Financieel Management, in recognition of his independent role in the leadership of our Group, his management skills and his board position. Under Mr. Pierre Boels Jr.'s leadership, we managed to significantly increase our sales and EBITDA, both organically and through acquisitions, having successfully executed and integrated 27 acquisitions since 2012. Our CEO has assembled an experienced management team with significant industry expertise, including: - Reiant Mulder, Chief Operations Officer of Central Europe and member of our Strategic Board with more than 20 years of services experience. - Guy Cremer, Chief Procurement Officer, working with us since 1989 and leading in the Fleet Management department since 2000. Additionally, Mr. Cremer was recognized with the award for ""Rental person of the year"" by ERA in June 2023 for his influential role in the shift towards lower carbon emission equipment last year; and - Martin Holmgren: Chief Operations Officer of Nordics and a member of our Strategic Board. Mr. Holmgren is also Vice President of ERA and has worked for almost 30 years in the construction and rental industry. Our highly qualified senior management team is in close contact with our local business directors, since investment decisions strongly benefit from local market knowledge. For example, the choice between opening a greenfield location when expanding into a new region or acquiring an established company in the region is based on local insights about rental company concentration provided by local business leaders: we consider acquisitions when rental concentration is high and greenfield expansion in locations where rental concentration is low. We have an external Advisory Board that meets five times a year and consists of a group of experienced entrepreneurs and leaders. This independent body advises the Management Board on policy matters and the general course of affairs of the Group. In addition, the Advisory Board and its individual members function as a critical sounding board for our Management Board.

We have set ambitious CSR targets to position ourselves as a front runner in the development of a safe and environmentally friendly business and a key partner to our customers in meeting their increasing needs and demands for more sustainable solutions. We believe that the core purpose of rental, compared to ownership, is the achievement of the efficient use of equipment and materials, therefore making a positive contribution to the circular economy. According to a research study ----- led by ERA, efficient use of equipment results in a reduction of approximately 30% to 50% of CO2 emissions (depending on specific user practice) and that the rental business model stimulates such efficient use. Our rental concept allows our customers and their end-customers to meet their objectives and targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality, safety and to reduce their carbon footprint. CSR topics are at the heart of our business model. We also chose to apply the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 (""GRI 2021"") Standards and Disclosures to report our sustainability-related data, to commit to the guidelines of UN Global Compact and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals relevant to our business. In addition, based on a formal materiality assessment, we have identified four focus areas covering all aspects of corporate and social responsibility, including Employee Care, Social Care, Customer Care and Environmental Care. We have also identified, key performance indicators in relation to each topic and set ambitious targets for 2025. We aim to be the leader in sustainable fleet investments, to enable our customers in executing their projects with the lowest level of emissions, while continuing to deliver profitable growth. Our Green Team, which includes members from our fleet, sales and marketing departments, has jointly set out a strategy to invest in anticipation of customer needs and develop ambitious and innovative solutions (including zero emission equipment) in their field. For our fleet, we invest in energy-efficient products to improve our energy performance. For example, our fleet includes electrical two-ton excavators, fully battery-operated six-meter telehandlers and over two-ton electric-wheeled loaders. We also have a wide availability of battery packs and have created solar panel roofs for site huts and new zero emission welfare units, which were both brought to market in 2022. Additionally, our fleet contains more than 1,000 Stage V engines meeting the EU standard for non-road machines with low emissions of particulate matter. Our state-of-the-art fleet adheres to strict environmental and safety performance standards and helps increase our customers' productivity while reducing their emissions footprint. Of our total energy powered fleet units (equipment driven by a motor and with all types of power), approximately 81% is electrically-powered as of December 31, 2022 and we aim to increase this percentage to 85% by 2025. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 67% of our fleet value was comprised of electric, hybrid and gas equipment and not motorized equipment (meaning, equipment without an engine or motor). We have steadily reduced the portion of our diesel-powered equipment as a percentage of fleet value over time, reaching 24% as of June 30, 2023 (excluding Stage V diesel powered equipment).

Acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy that we pursue either for geographical expansion (filling in gaps in our existing footprint), increase market share, acquire specialist knowledge, improve our competitive position, or acquire certain assets. We have a clear, defined and well-established acquisitions strategy with a dedicated integration team in place. The success of our international expansion and our ability to effectively integrate acquired companies is demonstrated by our track record of 27 successful acquisitions since 2012. In particular, we demonstrated our disciplined M&A strategy and execution with our transformative acquisition of Cramo in 2020. During the 6 months of the initial integration period, our management executed a clear integration plan to minimize execution risk related to the acquisition, while maintaining a high quality service for our customers and efficiently responding to their needs. In countries where Boels and Cramo had geographic overlap, such as in Germany, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, we focused our efforts on optimizing our depot network, rebranding and refurbishing Cramo's depots in Central Europe (including Germany), enhancing our cross-selling opportunities and optimizing our back-office functions. We also invested substantially in integrating the fleets in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, increasing the availability of fleet and our flexibility, allowing us to optimize our response to market demands. In 2021 and 2022, we invested in and deployed new equipment categories that meet specific local requirements as a result of our analyses of the local markets, in order to be less dependent on large projects, with the aim to reach small and medium enterprises and retail clients. As a result of such efforts, we were able to successfully integrate our Central European operations in only 10 months and achieved synergies in terms of centralization of our mutual best practices in our key operations: IT, finance, fleet management and human resources through the deployment of our One Boels strategy. As a result of these efforts, we believe we have realized significant synergies, which generate recurring savings in EBITDA and capital expenditures, ----- primarily due to the optimization of our procurement functions, the consolidation of our IT systems and the reduction of our corporate expenses (including as a result of the closing of Cramo's headquarters in Finland). We believe that our acquisition track record, including our ability to integrate companies, positions us for growth while strengthening our local presence. The success of our international expansion supports our financial and operational development and establishes us as a market consolidator in a fragmented equipment rental industry.

We also continuously work to mitigate our own climate impact by reducing energy consumption, increasing the use of renewable energy and increasing circularity of our products and operations. We reduce, reuse or recycle materials, reduce waste and handle hazardous waste properly. For facilities and installations, we invest in energy efficient products, services and design for energy performance improvement. For example, we have been increasing our energy efficiency while reducing our emissions through investments in sustainable technologies and services, LED lighting, solar panels, ----- better insulation or development of energy management systems. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our energy use relative to sales by 12%, compared to 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our gas usage by 28% to 8,900 MWh compared to 2021, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,670 tCO2 of our emissions. We are also improving logistics planning in order to limit emissions related to equipment deliveries, as well as increasing our purchase of more renewable energy. We also disclose the Group's greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) with clear reduction targets. In 2022, we announced a number of targets with respect to our carbon emissions for 2025, using 2021 as a baseline, including: - reduce our emissions (calculated in tCO2) relative to sales (Scope 1 and 2) by 20%; - reduce our energy use relative to sales (Scope 1 (direct energy use) and Scope 2 (purchased energy)) by 15%; and - increase our share of renewable electricity to above 92% (compared to 56% in 2022 and 49% in 2021). Simultaneously, we are assessing our scope 3 targets with the main initiatives expected to be set as soon as 2024.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategies,9.6.1,Achieve a leading position in all our markets and become a leading partner for our customers,"We intend to continue working to provide a high quality, one-stop-shop experience for both individual consumers and businesses, while ensuring that our entire rental range of products meets our customers' evolving demands, in order to achieve a leading market position in each of the markets we address. We believe that we are well-positioned to become the leading partner of our customers in all the geographies we serve. We believe that our customers already recognize us as a preferred one-stop-shop for their rental needs, primarily due to our diversification across products, end markets, general and specialist rental, and our strong European geographic coverage. Our acquisition of Cramo has demonstrated our ambition to keep strengthening and expanding our geographic coverage and diversifying our service offering. We believe we can achieve a leading position in our markets through our strong, long-term partnerships with our customers. In order to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner, we aim to provide full turn-key solutions, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment (including site huts, site safes, traffic sets and sanitation), in addition to value-added services such as logistics. For example, in 2021, we delivered full service rental solutions for a wind farm project in Lithuania by providing site huts, construction equipment and special tools, in addition to access control, on-site maintenance, and helping with planning, transportation, delivery. Since 2022, we provide full turnkey solutions for an automotive Gigafactory located in Berlin-Brandenburg. We combine our proximity to customers and our understanding of their needs in order to continue providing our customers with valueadded services and products.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategies,9.6.2,Grow through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions,"We have achieved an impressive track record of both sales and EBITDA growth through a strategic combination of strong organic growth and the successful integration of both our transformative and smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Through our acquisition strategy in particular, we have expanded to cover new geographic markets and have diversified our catalogue of products and services. We believe we have significant opportunities to continue growing organically due to our comprehensive network of 759 depots and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30, 2023. We intend to increase the density of our network in less concentrated regions which we believe have a strong potential of profitable growth through our clear greenfield expansion strategy. ----- We also intend to continue evaluating strategic acquisition targets to further strengthen and expand our operations and customer base, to selectively enter new markets over time, in particular in geographic areas with low rental company concentration to increase opportunities for upselling and cross-selling our products. In pursuing such acquisitions, we maintain the same disciplined, targeted, and opportunistic acquisition investment criteria that have historically enabled us to successfully identify acquisition targets and profitably acquire and integrate them. Successful integration of acquisitions is key to our strategy, and we believe we are well-positioned to integrate future acquisitions efficiently and profitably. We have dedicated integration teams supported by local teams with superior knowledge of their local markets to develop synergies in our fleet management, expedite the completion and integration of acquisitions and position us to achieve our long-term success.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategies,9.6.3,Drive digital innovation to increase productivity for our customers and improve our operational efficiency,"We have developed and intend to continue to develop digital services in order to improve our customers' experience and boost our operational performance. We believe that we are a leader in the development of new, innovative digital business models in our industry. We have developed and deployed new types of data- and connectivity-based solutions to connect our people, internal processes and fleet to our customers, such as our new smart application for mobile devices, ""Equipment Pool"", which improves customers' access to equipment and machines, while reducing transportation times to and from customers' construction sites . We believe that we can leverage our digital processes and use of data in a customer-focused manner in order to improve communication between our employees and our customers, better identify customers' needs and facilitate interactions and transactions with customers. Although we already have improved processes and digital tools in place to optimize our customers' experience, we intend to continue enhancing our rental websites, including those of Cramo, Boels Rental and IQ Pass, to add further equipment data and specifications and combine our general and specialist rental fleet in a single platform. We believe that such technological capabilities positions us to achieve the full potential of our one-stop-shop solutions. We also intend to continue leveraging digital tools to streamline and boost efficiency in our internal systems. For example, we have implemented a single group-wide financial system to monitor our cash flows and key performance indicators. We have also implemented our group-wide One Boels strategy in order to continue harmonizing systems and processes based on four pillars: (i) One IT approach; (ii) One financial organization, (iii) One fleet and procurement organization and (iv) One HR approach and organization. We have developed our One Boels strategy as a clear, distinct, and strong organization that focuses not only on our customers' needs, but also boosts our efficiency. We intend to continue enhancing our operational systems and processes to increase our operational and procurement efficiency, improve our strategic relationships with OEMs, strengthen our fleet management and negotiating position for strategic procurement and maintenance of our fleet, and enhance our employee retention.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Historically, we have had a more centralized business model where our rental fleet was managed centrally to optimize the allocation of equipment, while local managers organized by countries and depots offered knowledge of local markets. Cramo, on the other side, has historically had a more decentralized business group structure, where operating decisions were made at the country and business-unit level. With the integration of Cramo, we have developed a synergized approach, which aims to combine the best practices of both organizations by centralizing key operations such as procurement or fleet management, while we keep a flexible and locally oriented commercial approach for each market and geography. We believe that this approach, together with our close cooperation with, and monitoring of, our depots, business units and departments, positions us to achieve our strategy, whilst retaining our disciplined and flexible business and financial models.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In the six months ended June 30, 2023, this primarily represents the release of an accrual amounting to €(4.0) million and old accounts receivable balances in connection with our trade receivable financing amounting to €(1.9) million. (iii) In 2020, this primarily represents insurance compensation related to the destruction of a property in Germany, partially offset by the book value of such property, amounting to €(0.7) million, a book gain on a sold property in the Netherlands amounting to €(0.4) million and a release of a provision taken in prior years amounting to €(0.2) million. In 2021, this primarily represents the result of a sale and leaseback transaction in Belgium amounting to €(0.7) million and a release of accruals amounting to €(0.3) million, offset by additional Cramo Central Europe integration expenses amounting to €1.2 million and additional provisions related to integration risks of certain acquisitions amounting to €0.6 million. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, this primarily represents the book gain on a sale and lease back transaction in Germany amounting to €(0.9) million.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Industry,13.1.1,We are vulnerable to fluctuations and deteriorations in the economic conditions in the industries and markets in which we and our customers operate.,"We may be negatively impacted by economic downturns and uncertainty in any of the countries in which we operate or the global markets generally, as adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial activity, cause disruption and volatility and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. The demand for our products and services is dependent on, among other factors, the industries in which our customers operate, the general economy and the stability of the global credit markets. During economic downturns, certain of our customers may, for example, suspend or delay projects and events or become more likely to go out of business or default on their payment obligations towards us. We serve a large number of customers, with a significant portion of our business being derived from construction, infrastructure, civil engineering and industrial activities. Many of the industries we serve are cyclical and seasonal by nature, with activity levels that tend to increase during periods of economic growth, decline during economic downturns and vary from quarter to quarter. Consequently, a downturn in construction, infrastructure, civil engineering or industrial activities, or the economy as a whole, generally leads to decreased demand for our equipment. Downturns also intensify price competition as equipment rental providers seek to increase utilization of idle equipment, and inflation can result in increased operating expenses that we may not be able to fully pass onto our customers. For example, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, our employee benefits expenses outstripped our revenue growth, in part because we were unable to fully pass along the cost increases to our customers at the same rate as our costs increased. In particular, some of our operating expenses, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges in specific countries, are linked to indices, including the Consumer Price Index, which may increase due to inflation. Furthermore, any extended period of inflation may lead to a stagflation or recession, which could in turn lead to the postponement of construction, infrastructure, civil engineering and other industrial activities, thereby lowering the demand for our services. See ""—A regional or global health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business and _exacerbate other risks to which our business is exposed.""_ We operate across four geographic regions: the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe, and Other Countries. In the last twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated 23.8%, 35.3%, 37.8% and 3.0% of our total revenue in the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe and Other Countries regions, respectively. Within these regions, we are particularly exposed to the economic conditions in the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. Our end markets may be impacted, either temporarily or over the long-term, by changes in: - government infrastructure spending; - spending levels by either public or private customers; - the credit markets and other economic conditions affecting our customers' ability to undertake new projects or hold events, or otherwise impacting customers' demand for our products and services; - the cost of construction and other materials; or - weather conditions affecting a particular region. Changes in these or other factors caused by deterioration in the construction, infrastructure, civil engineering and other industrial sectors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future. If in any of our markets the economic conditions deteriorate or a return to economic growth is further delayed, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Industry,13.1.2,"The equipment rental industry is highly competitive, which puts downward pressure on prices.","The equipment rental industry is highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national, multi-regional and international equipment rental companies to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. In addition, we may encounter increased competition from existing competitors or new market entrants in the future. We face competition principally from pan-European and national rental companies, as well as from regional and local entities. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be more specialized or may have greater name recognition in some markets. We also face competition from smaller competitors operating at regional or local levels, many of which benefit from a strong market presence and local relationships. Over time, our competitors, whether pan-European, national, regional or local, could consolidate their businesses, and the diversified service offerings or increased synergies of these consolidated businesses could increase competition in the markets in which we operate. Competition is based on an array of different factors, some of which are interrelated, including: speed of integrating new or emerging technologies; technical specifications and condition of equipment; engineering solutions and technical know-how; range and timeliness of the products and services offered; availability of equipment; client relationships; ability to quickly adapt to client requirements; a track record of delivery; the willingness to accept higher contractual risks in tender contracts; price; compliance with health and safety and environmental standards; brand name and reputation; resources and budget available for marketing and sales of products and services; and relevant certifications. If we are unable to maintain our competitiveness in relation to one or more of these factors, we may not be able to grow our market share and may potentially lose existing client relationships, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the equipment rental market is increasingly becoming digitized and there is increased focus on the sustainability of equipment, factors which are beginning to be used as differentiators within the market and are central to our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to capitalize on such trends or achieve the expected benefits of this strategy, or that we will be able to successfully implement and maintain the necessary technologies, processes, and capabilities. Our digitalization strategy involves significant investments in our websites, enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") tools, asset monitoring and maintenance systems, online platforms and data systems, many of which are provided by third-party service providers and partners. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful, will generate the anticipated benefits and will not increase our exposure to other risks related to increasing reliance on information technology systems and third-party service providers. See ""—Risks related to our Business—Disruptions in _our information technology systems could limit our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations"" and ""— Risks related to our Business—Our business and reputation may be adversely affected by the actions of third parties.""_ Furthermore, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in growing our fleet of electrical, hybrid or batterypowered equipment. These investments can be costly and may become obsolete or ineffective due to changing customer preferences, market conditions, technological developments or other factors. Our customers might choose to use the services of our competitors rather than ours. Although our top 10 customers at Group level only represented approximately 7.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, our results would be negatively affected if we were to lose one or more of our key customers to our competitors or if such customers were to decrease their business with us for any reason. These or other changes to the competitive landscape of our industry could result in a loss of market share, decreased revenue and a decline in profitability. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete effectively by lowering rental rates or prices. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our operating expenses, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges in specific countries, are linked to indices, including consumer price indices, which may increase due to inflation. As such, price pressure can be particularly acute in an inflationary macroeconomic environment where we endeavor to offset increased operating costs, including the cost of purchasing equipment, by increasing the rental rates and prices that we charge our customers, and we may not always be able to sufficiently raise rates or prices to offset the impact of inflation on our costs. In addition, we may not be able to match a competitor's price reductions or fleet investment, which could cause our customers to reduce their level of business with us. Termination of contractual arrangements by our customers may result in decreased market share and revenue, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Industry,13.1.3,Future technological developments may render our current rental fleet technologically obsolete before the end of the initially estimated economic life.,"While technological development in the types of tools and equipment that we have traditionally focused our business on has been relatively slow as compared with other sectors that are characterized by more rapid technological change, our rental fleet is increasingly technologically advanced and dependent on complex systems and hardware ----- (including batteries) for their continued operation. Rapid technological evolution and disruptive technologies, failure to upgrade equipment with new technology in time and related changes in laws and regulations (for example, through governments requiring the use of lower emissions technology or by customers actively selecting more sustainable options), may render components of our rental fleet technologically obsolete or redundant prior to the end of their planned useful rental life. Although we seek to sell such redundant or obsolete products on the secondary market, a secondary market for such products may not exist or may be insufficient for our resale needs, which would adversely affect the prices at which we are able to sell and could require us to recognize impairments. Technical obsolescence and redundancy may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Industry,13.1.4,"A regional or global health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business and exacerbate other risks to which our business is exposed.","Public health crises, epidemics or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, governments around the world, including in most countries where we operate our activities, imposed restrictive measures to battle the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19, including travel restrictions, curfews, lockdowns, quarantines and shutdowns of businesses and workplaces. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our business operations were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results differed by country and by end market depending on the severity of the government restrictions imposed and the severity of the pandemic. For example, the suspension of large gatherings and events caused demand for our products and services from the events end market to sharply contract. Overall, we estimate that, on a like-for-like basis reflecting the acquisition of Cramo in 2020, we experienced a mid-single digit revenue decline in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our level of activity, in line with the decrease in market activity, was the sharpest in Italy, Austria, Belgium and the United Kingdom, where strict lockdown measures were imposed. There can be no assurance that a similar public health crisis will not occur again in the future on a global or regional basis and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to our Business,13.2.1,"Our international operations expose us to risks inherent to international business, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.","We have operations in 18 countries across Europe. As a result, we are subject to numerous, rapidly evolving and complex laws and regulations which govern, among other things, labor matters, immigration, health and safety, financial reporting standards, corporate governance, tax, trade regulations, export controls, and competitive practices in each jurisdiction where we conduct our business. In addition, changes in regulations could impact the ability of rental operators to utilize their equipment in certain types of projects, affecting the competitive landscape in those projects, as well as in other areas in which the non-conforming equipment may be redeployed. Furthermore, we need to comply with various local standards and practices of different regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies specific to each jurisdiction in which we operate. Further, we are also reliant on local managers to oversee the day-to-day functioning of our branches and to ensure their compliance with local law, and we may be subject to risks related to such compliance, including issues that may arise as a result of insufficient oversight. In such cases, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are multiple risks associated with the international nature of our operations, including inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions, unanticipated changes in the regulatory environment, political instability (such as the threat of war, terrorist attacks or civil unrest) and import and export restrictions. Furthermore, these risks may be greater in certain areas where we operate. Any of these events may affect our employees, reputation, business or financial results as well as our ability to achieve our strategy, including the following specific business risks: - adverse economic developments in economies around the world; - social and political instability in a number of countries around the world (such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine); - potential terrorist attacks; - epidemics and pandemics, which may adversely affect our workforce, suppliers and customers; - adverse changes in governmental policies, especially those affecting trade and investment and any regulations impacting the equipment rental business or commercial operations generally; ----- - differing local product preferences and requirements; - pressures on management time and attention due to the complexities of overseeing multinational operations; - challenges in maintaining, staffing, managing multinational operations; - differing tax and regulatory regimes; - differing labor laws and collective bargaining regimes; - enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions; - the foreign currency translation and transaction risks of operating in euro; - the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend will not perform as expected; - obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; - reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries; - compliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory and regulations relating to potential future acquisitions; - price controls; - ownership regulations; and - inflation, recession, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, burdensome fiscal policies and transfer restrictions. For example, on February 24, 2022, Russian military forces commenced a war against Ukraine, and conflict and disruption in the region is likely to continue. Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine are highly unpredictable, this conflict has led and could continue to lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and the supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyber-attacks. We have historically had indirect operations in Russia through Fortrent LLC (""Fortrent""), a 50%-owned joint venture with Ramirent Oyj, and which generated a gain of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was accounted for in our consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Considering the level of uncertainty due to the geopolitical situation resulting from the war in Ukraine and the high volatility of the Russian ruble, we fully impaired our investment in Fortrent in the year ended December 31, 2022, which included the write-down of the full amount of the carrying value of our investment in Fortrent amounting to €10.9 million, the depreciation of certain receivables amounting to €0.9 million and the reversal of the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €2.6 million for the period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reversed the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €1.1 million for the period. In June 2022, we, together with our joint venture partner, decided to sell Fortrent. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our interest in Fortrent continues to be held for sale.

The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Although we do not have any current activities in Russia or Ukraine, we have activities in Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic States, and if the conflict intensifies or expands beyond Ukraine, it could have an adverse impact on our business.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates and successfully integrate them into our business. Acquisitions are subject to several risks and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at commercially acceptable prices or terms. In particular, our industry is experiencing rapid consolidation which could impact our ability to achieve our strategy. See also ""—The success of our strategy depends in part on our ability to grow through _acquisitions and integrate acquisitions into our business."" Our growth strategy also depends in part on our ability to_ successfully identify and open new depots, both in countries where we already have an established presence as well as other countries to which we may decide to expand in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive new depot locations and successfully open and operate them. Opening new depots requires significant investments and management attention and may involve risks associated with entering new markets, including markets where we face significant competition. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to successfully identify and operate such new depots. Any significant diversion of management's attention, unexpected cost associated with or any major difficulties encountered in acquiring new businesses or operating new depots could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and make it more difficult for us to achieve our strategy. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we can make strategic acquisitions and open new depots, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, the success of our strategy, in particular with respect to organic growth, depends on our ability to accurately forecast trends. Our decisions about investments in new equipment, for example, are based in significant part on our views of future demand, and any failure to accurately predict demand could negatively affect our growth prospects. If anticipated growth does not occur, we may not earn the level of returns that we hope to achieve on investments made during the bottom of the cycle. Alternatively, if growth is greater than expected, we may not have a fleet of appropriate size and mix. More generally, uncertainty regarding future product demand in the markets in which we operate, or markets in which we seek to enter, could cause us to maintain excess equipment inventory and increase our capital expenditures beyond what is efficient. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of equipment for rental that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to our Business,13.2.3,The success of our strategy depends in part on our ability to grow through acquisitions and integrate acquisitions into our business.,"Historically, we have achieved growth in part through acquisitions and our strategy assumes that some future growth will occur inorganically, through further acquisitions of businesses that we believe complement or enhance our existing products, services, markets, capabilities or technologies. For example, in February 2020, we acquired Cramo Plc (""Cramo""), a provider of equipment rental and modular space solutions and greatly expanded our operations in the Nordics. Although the integration of the Cramo business into our Central Europe region is largely complete, we are continuing to undertake significant integration projects with respect to management structures and back-office functions, through our various ""One-projects"", including One-Finance, One-Fleet, One-HR and One-IT. A failure to successfully execute any of these integration projects on time, on budget and as envisaged could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices or on advantageous terms. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities we have and lead to higher acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we successfully acquire new businesses. In general, the risks associated with acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, include the following: - we may lose sales and incur substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems in integrating acquired businesses and integration may be more costly and take longer than expected; - we may not achieve financial and operational synergies on a timely basis or without significant costs, if at all; - acquisitions may divert management's attention from the operation of the existing business; ----- - the assumptions underlying the business plans supporting the valuations of the acquisitions and expected synergies may prove inaccurate, in particular with respect to the future performance of the acquired businesses; - we may be forced to divest or reduce the scope of certain businesses to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations, in particular with respect to anti-trust authorizations; - we may need to write down goodwill and certain other intangible assets from our balance sheet if our initial estimates of the value of an acquired business are higher than actual results; - we may be further exposed to risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company, which could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and customer relationships; - we may not be able to retain existing customers of the acquired business; - we may experience corporate or market cannibalization; - we may face increased competition; - we may operate an acquired company as a joint venture with partners with whom we lack a longstanding relationship; and - we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or liabilities related to the acquired businesses, their integration and the growth of our business, particularly in geographic areas in which we have not previously operated. In addition to the risks described above, the integration of acquired businesses may be more difficult and take more time due to logistical, regulatory, linguistic, cultural and other factors such as our relative lack of familiarity with a given market and its economic, political and social dynamics. If we are not successful in implementing our acquisition strategy or integrating such acquisitions, or if some or all of our existing or future acquisitions prove ultimately to be unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to our Business,13.2.4,We depend on equipment manufacturers to obtain adequate rental equipment for our fleet on a timely basis.,"We purchase most of our rental equipment from well-known original equipment manufacturers. We rely on our relationships with original equipment manufacturers to centralize our procurement and benefit from economies of scale. Failure to maintain these relationships, or successfully optimize our economies of scale in the future, could lead to higher unit costs for our procurement and present availability issues due to shortages of material or components such as microchips. As we do not manufacture any of the products that we rent to our customers, we rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of the equipment, tools, spare parts and consumables that are essential to our business. However, our suppliers may not be able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us on a timely basis or at all for logistical or strategic reasons, including issues affecting the global supply chain generally as a result of economic disruption. Further, suppliers may be unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us, or they may seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us. As a result, we could face increased costs for our equipment or longer delivery times. Delays in the delivery of new equipment may impair our ability to respond to increases in demand, put us at a disadvantage to our competitors and may cause us to miss opportunities in our markets. For instance, equipment manufacturers have recently faced and continue to face supply chain difficulties, in particular with respect to the raw materials needed to manufacture chips and batteries, and as a result, we have recently experienced, and continue to experience, delays in deliveries of purchased equipment. In addition, delays in delivery can adversely affect our equipment maintenance and relocation costs, as there may no longer be local demand for the purchased equipment by the time it arrives at the point of delivery. We may experience further delays or an inability to source new equipment on a timely basis or at all. We may not be able to find alternative sources of supply for the equipment we purchase in each of our core product categories, and the termination or delay of equipment orders by a major supplier could adversely affect our business. If we are required to procure more costly equipment, our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to pass the cost increases of such equipment through to our customers. Furthermore, while our top 10 suppliers at Group level only represented approximately 11.1% of our total expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2022, our procurement processes could be negatively affected if our business relationships with any of our top 10 suppliers are disrupted, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ----- Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to our Business,13.2.5,"The cost of equipment purchases for our rental fleet, in addition to other operating costs, may increase.","The cost of new equipment that we purchase for our rental fleet may increase as a result of a number of factors, including increased raw material costs (such as costs of steel), scarcity of component parts necessary to manufacture our rental equipment (such as microchips and batteries), increased labor costs, inflation generally or geopolitical developments and other world events. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine destabilized the financial and commodity markets and resulted in an uncertain macroeconomic situation in Europe, causing inflation throughout the economy, rises in interest rates and volatile energy prices and such factors have had, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the cost of new equipment we purchase for our rental fleet. In particular, the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of our equipment and products, rose sharply in 2021 as countries around the world began to recover from the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and has continued to rise following the commencement of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine due to a combination of sanctions against Russian producers and disruptions of production in Ukraine. While additional capacity currently exists that can replace the foregoing volumes, increases in the spot prices of steel in Europe may nonetheless persist. Further increases in prices of raw materials could cause the price of new equipment to rise, which could materially affect our business to the extent that we are not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers. In addition, we are subject to risks related to the increases in energy or transportation costs. Energy prices are in turn subject to significant volatility caused by, among other things, inflation, market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, tariffs, resource availability, geopolitical developments and other world events, as well as climate change related conditions and other factors beyond our control. High energy and transportation costs could increase the price of new equipment purchases, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, higher energy and transportation costs could significantly increase our operating costs. In 2022, partially as a result of the increase in fuel prices stemming from the conflict in Ukraine, we saw a significant increase in our logistics costs compared to prior years. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing our logistics costs through our hub-and-spoke logistics model or in passing along such costs to our customers. Any future increases in our logistics costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Changes in customer demand due to changed technology, safety or environmental concerns, regulations, or other factors could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment, which would increase our costs. Further, electric, hybrid and battery powered equipment each have a purchasing cost which is significantly higher than similar equipment using older and less environmentally friendly engines. Purchasing electric, hybrid and battery powered equipment also incurs costs associated with training our employees and customers on the use, maintenance, safety requirements, and repair of the new technology. Due to the significantly higher purchasing costs of electric, hybrid and battery powered equipment our capital expenditure is expected to increase in the future. There can be no assurances that potential maintenance costs savings will offset the expected increase in capital expenditure.

Rental equipment asset management requires that we build up and maintain an inventory of durable, high-quality products that anticipate the needs of our customers and changes in technology, legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which we operate. In addition, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the economic life of the products and, to a lesser extent, the proceeds that may be received from the sale of these products. As the needs of our customers change, we may need to incur costs to relocate or retrofit our rental assets to better meet shifts in demand, beyond relocations that occur in the ordinary course of business to maximize fleet uptime and address customer demand. In addition, if the location of our assets is not efficiently coordinated with regional demand, we may incur costs from relocating the fleet (which includes costs associated with local regulatory compliance, as well as transportation and storage) or we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our rental assets, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, where we have contracts that employ the use of our rental equipment for long durations, we may be exposed to the risk that our costs increase materially over the term of the project, whether due to inflation, rising interest rates or adverse movements in currency exchange rates, and we are unable to pass on those cost increases to such customers where fixed pricing has been agreed. If the project is significant (or if there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects) or experiences cost overruns, delays or issues with the quality or availability of supplies, any of these may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ----- As the equipment in our rental fleet ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, generally increases, and we may be unable to pass along such costs to customers. Determining the optimal average age for disposal of our rental fleet is subjective and requires considerable estimates by management. Additionally, maintenance of newer, electric and hybrid equipment may be costlier than the maintenance cost of older gas- and dieselpowered equipment, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to pass those costs through to our customers.

Our information technology systems also facilitate our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. The administration of our business is increasingly reliant on the use of IT systems and artificial intelligence to digitalize processes and systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has risen as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased. Additionally, due to the significant efforts to digitalize our business, an increasingly larger amount of data is stored in IT systems and vulnerable to data security breaches. Our information technology systems may not be fully protected against such third-party intrusions or against viruses, ransom ware, or similar threats. Disruptions resulting from these threats, system crashes or other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use several ERP systems across our network and any disruption to our ERP systems, or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results. We back-up most of our data daily, train our employees in this regard, perform penetration testing and have a disaster recovery plan in place for most of our systems, including our ----- ERP system. However, our disaster recovery plan does not cover all of our systems. Our back-up systems may fail, and any recovery of our data may be incomplete or subject to delay. In addition, because our systems may contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately safeguard the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities. In most of the regions in which we operate, the processing of personal data is subject to governmental regulation and legislation.

Our finance costs are sensitive to interest rates, exchange rates and other monetary policies of governments and central banks in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We and certain of our subsidiaries borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates, which exposes us to the risk of rising interest rates, and on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, a significant amount of our indebtedness will bear interest at a floating rate. Although we seek to hedge against our interest-bearing liabilities through interest rate swaps, these instruments may not be effective or available in all circumstances. A sustained increase in inflation may result in higher interest rates on our borrowings (including finance leases) that are subject to a floating rate of interest, increasing our financial expenses and cost of borrowing.

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our debt facilities, including our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and our Trade Receivables Purchase Program. This cash may be insufficient, and we may require additional financing to obtain capital for, among other purposes, operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, acquisitions and debt service payments. Additionally, there is the risk that our capital expenditures will increase due to ineffective planning of investments or asset sales.

Accordingly, movements in exchange rates between any of these currencies and euro could have an adverse effect on our results of operations to the extent we have a mismatch between our earnings in ----- any foreign currency and our costs that are denominated in that currency. We also incur currency risk on the net investment in our subsidiaries in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. The results of operations and financial position of these subsidiaries are reported in the relevant functional currency of that subsidiary.

Significant increases in the value of the euro relative to foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Although we routinely engage in derivative transactions to hedge against any such fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against such risks. For example, our revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was negatively affected by the weakening of the Swedish krona, Norwegian krone and the British pound against the euro.

In the situation that no IIR applies at the ultimate parent entity level, a lower level parent entity may be required to apply the IIR. A secondary fall back is provided by an undertaxed payment rule (the ""UTPR"") in case the IIR has not been applied. The UTPR can be applied by (i) limiting or denying a deduction or (ii) making an adjustment in the form of an additional tax.

The Existing Senior Facilities bear interest at interest rates tied to EURIBOR. ----- EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, you should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).

The subsidiaries intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations under the Notes through a combination of dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans and repayment of intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or Guarantees of obligations under, the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. If our subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have sufficient sources of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. Further, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions or capital expenditure, sell significant assets, discontinue specified operations or obtain additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.

Finally, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. The Collateral may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy and/or judicial liquidation, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities, including holders of the Notes, may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer's and any Guarantor's remaining assets. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.

The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that, prior to the discharge of all senior liabilities (including the Notes), consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders' commitments under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the hedge counterparties’ senior obligations that are owed senior hedging liabilities and any other senior creditors or other noteholders in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors (the ""Senior Credit Participations"") which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Credit Participations at that time (the ""Majority Senior Creditors"") (in each case, acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing, the transaction security, then, in certain cases, junior creditors holding more than an agreed percentage of the junior credit participations (such percentage being prescribed in the relevant second lien facility agreement) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds, or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities, or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. In connection with acting in accordance with any instructions received by it, the Security Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any creditor or group of creditors until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require. To the extent we incur additional senior indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be further diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released.

In such an event, the holders of the Notes would be bound by any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders of the Notes. The creditors under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and holders of any other senior secured debt entitled to provide instructions regarding enforcement may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and such creditors may elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents, or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions and accepted the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Further, although the Indenture will restrict the Issuer's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' (as defined herein) ability to pledge any assets as collateral to secure other debt, and will require the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to secure the Notes equally and ratably if the Issuer pledges any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, ----- both the restriction on pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See ""Description of the Notes—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Liens."" For example, if the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security_ interests securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of the Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or the Guarantees equally and ratably. To the extent, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt or other obligations without also securing the Notes and the Guarantees, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to such debt or other obligations to the extent of the value of such assets. For example, the Existing Senior Facilities currently benefit from residual pledges over the share capital of certain non-material subsidiaries in Austria, Poland, Italy and the Czech Republic that previously guaranteed the Existing Senior Facilities as well as security over certain bank accounts and certain intercompany receivables of said non-material subsidiary in the Czech Republic, that will not secure the Notes. The Issuer may seek majority lender consent pursuant to the terms of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement to release such security at a future date. In addition, the Trade Receivables Purchase Program is currently expected to be secured on a first priority basis by certain collection accounts for trade receivables in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, that will not secure the Notes.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the pari passu ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Specifically, the Collateral is located in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and the multijurisdictional nature of any enforcement of the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors' rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. There can be no assurance that the value of the Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest or to the secured amount stated in the relevant Security Document (which may be lower than the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest), and the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under Dutch, Austrian, Belgian, English, Finnish, German, Norwegian, Swedish or other applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, unfair or voidable preference and insolvent transactions, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance, related party transactions, security registration or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See ""Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.""_ Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, Guarantees and security interests can be challenged (for example, by the bankruptcy receiver or insolvency trustee, in the case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents) or by any party granting the security interests and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or to the party granting the security interests, if the court found, inter alia, that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or the above-referred party was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest; ----- - the Guarantor or the party granting the security interests did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor or such party was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or of such party. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a party granting the security interests was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or its security interests were granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted unfair or voidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or voidable conveyances on other grounds. In addition, under German law, among others, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant Collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or security interest could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security interest was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Further, the Security Documents will provide that the Security Agent must not enforce the security rights granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Germany over the Collateral to the extent enforcement of the Collateral would result in the amount of the Guarantor's net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) to fall below its stated share capital or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital and thereby violating sections 30 and 31 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act. Furthermore, the enforcement of the Collateral granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded (entirely) pursuant to certain limitations contained in the relevant Security Documents, in case the granting or enforcement of such Collateral and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so secured finance party under such Collateral. These limitations may have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the security interests over the Collateral, potentially even to zero. See _""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the _Guarantees and_ _Certain insolvency law considerations.""_ There is also a risk that the Collateral may be held invalid by a German court because the initial value of the Collateral significantly exceeds the secured obligations (over-collateralization), including the liabilities under the Notes. Under case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), security arrangements granting excessive collateral may be invalid, if overall, in light of the motivation of the secured parties and the purpose of the collateral, the taking of excessive collateral is not reconcilable with good faith standards. The German Federal Supreme Court has held that collateral is excessive, if it can be expected at the time the relevant security arrangements are entered into, that the value of the collateral will be in obvious disproportion (auffälliges Missverhältnis) to the amount of the secured obligations at the time of enforcement. German courts have, however, not established specific numerical levels or ratios to determine whether collateral is deemed to be excessive at the time the security arrangements are entered into. Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher (exceeding 110 %) than the value of the obligations secured by such security. A summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Collateral in respect of German law is set out in Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations – Germany._ ----- The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we make dividends. The payment of dividends by a Guarantor or by the party granting the security interests to the Issuer to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to those Guarantors or parties to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees or the Security Documents. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders' resolutions and board resolutions. In addition, judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Instead, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will consider involving a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may require considerable time to complete. For all of the foregoing, an investment in the Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or may apply differently in a differently structured bond offering.

A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Existing Senior Facilities and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to allow us to purchase the Notes or we may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.

There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway or Sweden of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway or Sweden would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time.

Additionally, an increase in our gross indebtedness in connection with the Transactions could be viewed negatively by ratings agencies.

For example, our ultimate principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividend distributions, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of our principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due.

The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

(2) Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. For further information, see ""—Line Item Classification"" below. _Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information_ A. Goodwill Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. The amortization for the period presented has therefore been reversed within profit or loss. The impact is a reversal of €46.7 million amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 presented under depreciation and amortization expenses. ----- B. Leases At the date of transition to IFRS on January 1, 2021, we applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (twelve months or less). As we started accounting under IFRS as of January 1, 2021 for our entities in the Netherlands, we did not have the IFRS 16 accounting tools in place in 2020. In the Nordics (entities acquired in the context of our acquisition of Cramo), IFRS 16 accounting tools were in place in 2020. As a result, for those countries where IFRS 16 accounting tools were not in place in 2020, we have made estimations based on the actual lease expenses in 2020 and the Right of Use starting point at January 1, 2021. The total impact on the profit and loss statement for the ended December 31, 2020 amounts to: - depreciation of right-of-use assets presented under depreciation and amortization expenses of €53.6 million were recognized in 2020; - lease expenses presented under material and services of €55.3 million were reversed in 2020; - lease liabilities interest expenses of €5.3 million presented under finance expense were recognized in 2020; and - the recognition of €0.3 million of revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020 which was presented under revenue. C. Trade and other receivables The adoption of IFRS fundamentally changed our accounting for impairment losses for financial assets by replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forward-looking expected credit loss (""ECL"") approach. IFRS requires us to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and contract assets. We assessed the impact of the change on transition date of January 1, 2021 to be recognized in the statement of profit or loss for 2020 which has led to a decrease in net impairment losses on financial assets in an amount of €1.2 million. D. Revenue Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business are recognized on a net (agent) basis. The application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of revenue on a gross (principal) basis and accordingly an increase in revenue was recognized in the 2020 financial year. We adjusted this by an increase of revenue of €8.5 million and an equivalent decrease in material and services. We also adjusted revenue by €0.3 million for revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020. See ""—B. Leases"" above. E. Deferred tax The various transitional adjustments (leases, trade and other receivables) results in different temporary differences. Deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction in income tax expense. The total adjustment amounts to €0.3 million additional tax expenses in 2020. F. Defined benefit obligations Defined benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS19). The pension expenses in 2020 related to defined benefit plans, which amounted to €0.8 million. This has been adjusted under employee benefits expenses. G. Statement of cash flows Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as cash outflows from financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities increased by €50.1 million and cash outflows from financing activities increased by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2020. _Line Item Classification_ Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements for purposes of the 2020 comparative financial information presented in the FY 2021 Financial Statements. Certain of these line items have been reclassified in this Offering Memorandum to conform to IFRS presentation requirements.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.1,Overview,2375.1.1,,"We are a leading rental equipment specialist in Europe. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, with strong market positions across our main markets, including the largest market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden and the second largest market share in each of Germany and Finland, in each case in terms of revenue in 2022. Our family-owned business started out of four garage boxes in the 1970s, and, under five decades later, has expanded into an industry leader with an extensive network of 759 depots in 18 European countries and a fleet of approximately 860,000 rental units as at June 30, 2023. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €1,524.9 million in revenue and €540.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA. We serve customers in a variety of end-markets from civil engineering, industrial, construction and infrastructure to events and warehousing. Our core product offering includes general and specialist rental equipment alongside complementary products and services, enabling us to be a one-stop-shop for our customer base of both corporate clients (business-to-business) and individuals including craftsmen and retail clients (business-to-consumer). Our generalist division is mainly focused on the less cyclical 'fit-out, maintain and operate' market segments which use lighter equipment, while our specialist division is tailored to reach niche markets, such as site preparation, sanitation and access control. With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe, for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer ""do-it-yourself"" (""DIY"") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training courses, project management and emergency assistance. In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions: - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; and - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue (representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8 ""Operating Segments"" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see ""Presentation of _Financial Information—Operating Segments.""_ ----- We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group, is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020. We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements. Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996, we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs. The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers' industries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In preparing the FY 2022 Financial Statements, our opening statement of financial position was prepared as of January 1, 2021, the date of our transition to IFRS.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.3,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,2375.3.1,Economic Conditions,"Demand for our products is dependent on the industries in which our customers operate, the general economy and other factors. Many of the markets in which our customers operate are cyclical, with activity levels that tend to increase during periods of economic growth and decline during economic downturns. Demand for our products is correlated to conditions in these industries and in the general economy, including credit markets. Conditions in the markets in which our customers operate have an impact on both the utilization rate of our equipment and on prices. As demand increases, so do utilization rates, and we can then, subject to existing agreements with customers, choose to allocate equipment to customers who are willing to pay higher prices. When demand decreases, so do utilization rates, and we may reduce prices to preserve utilization levels. Demand can be affected by general economic trends and cycles that can have an impact (positive or negative) over a longer period and by short-term factors, such as seasonality, that affect the utilization rates and prices for a brief period. See ""—Seasonality"" below. In the past, we have managed the impact of medium and long-term trends by optimizing our rental fleet utilization rate, developing specialist activities focused on non-construction-related niche markets (such as the DIY market and the market for pumping equipment), diversifying our customer base by investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction-related customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction such as the fit-out, maintain and operation phases. We seek to further manage such trends through adjustment of our investments in new equipment, increases or decreases in sales of our equipment and the management of our depot network. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our business operations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results differed by country depending on the severity of the government restrictions imposed and the severity of the ----- pandemic. The decrease in our level of activity, in line with the decrease in market activity, was most notable in Italy, Austria, Belgium and the United Kingdom, where strict lockdown measures were imposed. In particular, as the entire events industry came to a halt, demand from the events end market sharply contracted. Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on certain aspects of our business, such as unit rentals and our DIY business. We deployed a number of measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the Group, including lowering the planned levels of capital expenditure and introducing a significant cost savings program. See also ""—Operating Expenses"" below. After a decrease in demand in 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the equipment rental market rebounded in line with the construction market, which benefitted from household savings, low interest rates and a relaunch of governmental construction projects. As a result of the measures we implemented in response to the pandemic and the recovery in demand that followed, we were able to generate positive Reported EBITDA of €432.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (based on the Reconciled Financial Information), and we increased our sales across all of our geographic regions in the year ended December 31, 2021, most notably in Northern Europe, driven by general economic growth and several large projects. Since February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilized the financial and commodity markets and resulted in an uncertain macroeconomic situation in Europe, causing inflation throughout the economy, to which central banks have responded with rises in interest rates, and volatile energy prices. Although we have continued to experience growth in revenue and Reported EBITDA, these macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for rental services and, paired with other economic developments, impact our operating expenses and the cost of new equipment we purchase for our rental fleet. In addition, we have historically had a shareholding in Fortrent, a 50% owned joint venture with Ramirent Oyj with operations in Russia, which was accounted for in our consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Considering the level of uncertainty due to the geopolitical situation resulting from the war in Ukraine and the high volatility of the Russian ruble, we fully impaired our investment in Fortrent in the year ended December 31, 2022, which included the write-down of the full amount of the carrying value of our investment in Fortrent amounting to €10.9 million, the depreciation of certain receivables amounting to €0.9 million and the reversal of the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €2.6 million for the period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reversed the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €1.1 million for the period. In June 2022, we, together with our joint venture partner, decided to sell Fortrent. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our interest in Fortrent continues to be held for sale. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased our revenue and Reported EBITDA by 11.6% and 10.8%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, demonstrating the resilience of our business model. In this period, each of our geographic regions experienced strong performance, with revenue generated by the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe and Other Countries (primarily Italy and the United Kingdom) regions increasing by 17.8%, 9.9%, 9.8% and 8.7%, respectively, compared to the prior year. In addition, while the inflationary environment resulted in an increase in our operating expenses during the year, particularly repair and maintenance expenses, transportation expenses and housing expenses, we were able to preserve our margins through our ability to increase prices and generate operational efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Established in 2008 as part of Backe, BAS Maskinutleie",2375.5.1,"Capital Expenditures, Fleet Age and Equipment Disposals","The management of our level of capital expenditure by increasing or decreasing the amount of investment in our fleet is an important factor in our results of operations and cash flow. Decisions about investment in new equipment are based on the condition and remaining useful life of our existing equipment as well as on our views of future demand, legislative developments and the industry transition towards higher sustainability standards. During growth cycles, we may decide to invest in our fleet by replacing aging equipment or equipment at the end of its useful economic life and by expanding the total size of the fleet, which in turn also reduces the average age of the fleet. In downturns we have the ability to limit capital expenditures to the replacement equipment at the end of its useful economic life and let the average age of the fleet slowly increase in order to conserve cash. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) amounted to €356.0 million and €533.4 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) amounted to €206.5 million on a Dutch GAAP basis, with no adjustments to this figure in the Reconciled Financial Information. In addition, we benefit from a well-invested fleet of rental equipment with an average fleet age significantly below the average useful life, which enables us to control our maintenance capital expenditure levels. As a proxy, we target annual maintenance capital expenditure of approximately 10% of our total fleet purchase value, less income generated from the sale of used equipment. Our Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) during the period under review related primarily to growth in activity, greenfield depot openings and the development of a diversified, sustainable fleet in order to position us to capitalize on growth opportunities. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, investments in our fleet increased the number of serialized rental items by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, reflecting a broadening of our existing assortment and our continued investment in the Eco-label fleet. These investments resulted in a decrease in the weighted average fleet age from 55 months in 2021, to 54 months in 2022 and 53 months as of June 30, 2023. We determine the allocation of investments in our rental fleet by the type of equipment and the requirements of our business units. We divide our equipment into several subgroups, which enables us to analyze the best strategic deployment, combined with the best possible use for customers, the lowest downtime and the most efficient economies of scale. As of June 30, 2023, our rental units were comprised of approximately 39% tools, 27% energy and climate, 13% material handling, 11% site huts and site preparation, 5% earthmoving and 4% access equipment. We continue to invest in our fleet to remain on top of market developments and play a leading role in the energy transition within the equipment rental sector, with a substantial amount of our planned capital expenditure to be invested in our Eco-label and zero-emission fleet. Of our total energy powered fleet, approximately 81% is electric as of June 30, 2023 and we aim to increase this percentage to 85% by 2025. Our aim is to be the frontrunner in investing in innovative solutions to increase the sustainability of our fleet. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of assets in our fleet. In a typical year, we target selling assets in our fleet with a resale value of between €50 million and €60 million and realizing a profit margin compared to book value of between 40% and 50% depending on market conditions. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 3.4% of our revenue from the sale of assets in our fleet. We sell assets in our fleet when we believe that these assets have reached the end of their useful life because they have become obsolete or when the cost of maintaining them in proper condition for customer use is too high. We may also sell assets in our fleet before the end of their useful life if we believe a decline in demand in a given market is likely to last for a significant period of time or if otherwise economical to do so. For instance, in 2022, the market for used equipment showed a high level of volatility and, as a result, we decided to resell certain categories of equipment and purchase new and more sustainable substitute equipment. The following table sets forth certain information on our fleet for the periods indicated.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Established in 2008 as part of Backe, BAS Maskinutleie",2375.5.2,,"serves the construction market from eight geographically spread locations. - On May 15, 2023, our subsidiary, Cramo AB, completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of KraftX AB (""KraftX""). KraftX is a leading provider in Sweden for power generators and emergency power supply. The company offers customers full-service power provision, from designing of the required power solution, rental and installation, through to support during the rental period. From its nine outlets across Sweden, KraftX serves customers in the construction, infrastructure and energy industries. Acquisitions impact our financial position and results of operations in a variety of ways. We incur costs related to the acquisition of the business, including the purchase price of the acquired business and the costs of integrating the acquired business, including any costs related to the generation of synergies. We take a conservative valuation approach and typically aim to pay EBITDA multiples of less than 4.5x for bolt-on acquisitions. Acquisitions may result in the addition of new depots and the closure of existing ones as we seek to optimize our fleet management and streamline our operations, which can impact on our sales from one period to the next. In addition, acquisitions can impact the comparability of our results between periods as our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place include the results of the acquired business only from the date of completion of the acquisition and the full impact of the acquired business is only reflected in subsequent periods. See ""—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Acquisition _of Cramo"" below._ In addition to expanding through acquisitions, we have also grown organically during the period under review by opening greenfield depots, which in turn, contribute to our sales. Along with acquired depots, greenfield depot openings enable us to continue to strategically expand our depot network to ensure geographic coverage for our customer base and serve additional customer demand. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we added 19 greenfield depots and 23 greenfield depots, respectively, which contributed to our sales growth over those periods, particularly in our general rental business. Between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2023, after the integration of Cramo Central Europe, we estimate that more than 90% of our revenue growth has been organic. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Some of our operating expenses, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges in certain countries, may be linked to indices, including consumer price indices, which may increase due to inflation. The management of our costs is an important factor in our results of operations and cash flows. With our centralized fleet ownership model, we seek to deploy our fleet efficiently across our network to respond to actual or anticipated increases and decreases in demand rather than renting additional equipment from third parties to then rent it out to our customers or duplicating investments in the same piece of equipment in different geographies, which could eventually lead to over-capacity. We also monitor our costs and margins on a regular basis. For example, when faced with more challenging market conditions in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a significant cost savings program, which included cutting certain fixed costs, such as staff costs through utilizing temporary contracts to increase the flexibility of our workforce during the period, as well as rationalizing our investment program on our fleet to focus on added value. In addition, we use temporary staffing from local employment agencies and contractor agencies where additional resources are needed for specific projects or to fill a vacant position in the short term, which enables us to maintain flexibility in our staff costs. For example, from March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our usage of temporary staff to manage our costs. Following the recovery in market activity in 2021, we increased our usage of temporary staff, which, together with higher hourly rates reflecting labor market shortages and the inflationary environment, resulted in an increase in our temporary staffing costs. This increase is reflected in our employee benefits expense in our statement of profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

For example, in certain regions in which we operate, demand in the construction and civil engineering markets tends to decrease in winter and during extended periods of inclement weather while increasing in the summer and during extended periods of mild weather. However, the seasonality impact on our results of operations is relatively small given regional variations in the response to working practices in connection with weather, as some regions experience little to no change in operational activity despite weather variations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are exposed to currency translation risk. We use forward exchange contracts to hedge some of our currency risks, mainly related to our cash flows in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. However, we cannot eliminate all of our currency risks, and any significant or prolonged adverse movements in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our profitability, cash flows and financial position. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with a nominal value of €383.0 million and €250.3 million, respectively, and a positive market value of €2.5 million and €2.4 million, respectively.

Our policy is to hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps, which effectively convert some of our floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities. However, we are not fully hedged and we remain exposed to changes in interest rates on our unhedged borrowings and on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 69% of the outstanding principal amount of our Existing Term Loan B was hedged through February 2028 with €1,000 million in notional amount of interest rate swaps. Pursuant to such interest rate swaps, the fixed interest rate at which EURIBOR has been swapped is 0.44% until February 2026, 2.84% between February 2026 and February 2027, and 2.68% between February 2027 and February 2028.

On November 11, 2019, we entered into a combination agreement with Cramo, pursuant to which we made a voluntary recommended public cash tender offer to purchase the outstanding shares in Cramo. Pursuant to the tender offer, on February 5, 2020, we acquired approximately 93.04% of the issued and outstanding shares in Cramo. For practical reasons, we consolidated Cramo in our financial statements as of February 1, 2020. Pursuant to a subsequent redemption process and squeeze-out procedure, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares in Cramo on June 3, 2020. Our audited consolidated financial statements and the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect the results of Cramo for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 only.

Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 10.0% to €269.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from €244.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to strong performance in the general rental product portfolio in Germany and the Czech Republic, with modest growth in Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg. Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 2.7% to €281.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from €274.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to organic growth in most countries within the region as well as the acquisitions of BAS Maskinutleie in Norway and Hyresbutiken and KraftX in Sweden, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate of each of the Swedish krona and the Norwegian krone against the euro. Revenue generated by the Other Countries region slightly increased by 1.3% to €23.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from €23.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to organic growth, as well as the acquisition of Illumin8 Lights in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate of the British pound against the euro. _Operating Expenses_ Materials and Services Materials and services expenses increased by 4.0% to €269.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €259.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increase in logistics costs, mainly attributable to the sales growth during the period, as well as higher prices for fuel, parts and services. Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense increased by 12.1% to €222.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €198.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees to 7,058 full time equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2023, from 6,692 full time equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as well as growth in wages and salaries which were increased as a result of the inflationary environment over the period. In addition, we incurred higher expenses for temporary staff in the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to an increase in the number of temporary staff and higher hourly rates for such temporary staff. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 6.4% to €171.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €160.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the significant increase of capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting investments in our rental fleet and acquisitions. See ""—Capital Expenditures"" below. Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Net impairment losses on financial assets decreased by 21.4% to €1.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €1.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to improved aging of outstanding receivables, which reduced loss allowances of trade and other receivables. _Financial Income and Expense_ Our net financial expense increased significantly from a net expense of €30.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 to a net expense of €43.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest expense in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in EURIBOR, which impacted the rate at which interest accrued on our unhedged floating-rate indebtedness, and an increase in our gross indebtedness over the period. We benefitted from the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging policy, which partially mitigated the impact of the increase in EURIBOR over the period. ----- _Income Tax Expense_ Our income tax expense increased to €14.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €5.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for carry forward losses from previous years in Germany and Finland in 2022, which we partially allocated to the six months ended June 30, 2022. _Profit for the period_ As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €39.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 21.7%, compared to a profit of €50.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The vast majority of our revenue growth in 2022 was organic as a result of the expansion of our depot network by 19 new locations, bringing the total to 743 as of December 31, 2022. Growth from acquisitions in the period was limited to the acquisition of Eekels Pompen in the year ended December 31, 2022, which also added three depots to our network. Revenue generated by the Netherlands region increased by 17.8% to €340.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from €288.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in sales from our general rental activities, strong growth in sales from specialist rental activities (including from the acquisition of Eekels Pompen), as well as an increase in sales to the industrial end market. Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 9.9% to €514.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from €467.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to sales growth across all countries within the region, with notable growth in Eastern European markets, while Belgium and Luxembourg showed stable performance under tougher economic circumstances during the year. Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 9.8% to €569.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from €518.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strong performance and growth in sales across all countries in the region, supported by investment in our fleet in both years. Sweden and Finland, our two largest markets within the region, experienced notable growth, with Sweden particularly supported by large industrial projects. Despite the uncertainty and geopolitical developments in the region, the Baltic countries showed the strongest growth in the Northern Europe region. In addition, Norway experienced significant growth in sales compared to the prior year, despite a stronger competitive environment. Revenue generated by the Other Countries region increased by 8.7% to €46.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from €42.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by strong economic conditions in the construction industry in the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively, in 2022, following the market recovery in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic. _Operating Expenses_ Materials and Services Materials and services expenses increased by 12.1%, in line with the increase in sales during the year, to €535.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €477.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in logistics costs, mainly attributed to the sales growth during the year, as well as higher prices for fuel, parts and services and certain rental related services. Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense increased by 12.3%, in line with the increase in sales during the year, to €410.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €365.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees to 6,515 full time equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 6,329 full time equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2021, to support the growth of our business and annual salary increases driven by inflation during the year. ----- Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 7.7% to €326.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €303.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the significant increase of capital expenditures in tangible and intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in increased depreciation of property, plant and equipment. See ""—Capital Expenditures"" below. Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Net impairment losses on financial assets increased by 15.6% to €3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in activities and sales, resulting in an increase in expected credit losses. Other Operating Expenses We recognized other operating expenses of €11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to nil in the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the write-down of our investment in Fortrent. See ""—Key Factors Affecting _Results of Operations—Economic Conditions"" for additional information. Financial Income and Expense_ Our net financial expense increased from a net expense of €70.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to a net expense of €71.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest expense in 2022 as a result of an increase in EURIBOR, which impacted the rate at which interest accrued on our floating-rate indebtedness, and an increase in our gross indebtedness compared to 2021. This increase was partially offset by the repricing of our Existing Term Loan B in June 2021, which resulted in lower interest rate margins in the second half of 2021. We also benefitted from the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging policy, which partially mitigated the impact of the increase in EURIBOR over the period. _Income Tax Expense_ Our income tax expense decreased by 32.4% to €14.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognized for carry forward losses from previous years in Germany and Finland in the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by an increase in current tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Share of Profit of Joint Venture_ Our share of profit of joint venture was nil in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our decision to classify our investment in the Fortrent joint venture as assets held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2022. See ""—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Economic _Conditions"" for additional information. Profit for the year_ As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €100.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 25.3% compared to a profit of €80.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

See ""—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our _Results of Operations—Acquisition of Cramo."" Excluding the acquisition of Cramo, the remainder of our revenue growth_ was primarily organic. Revenue generated by the Netherlands region increased by 2.1% to €288.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €282.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in general rental activity, partially offset by a decrease in activities related to the industrial and chemical and petrochemical industry end markets. Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 6.4% to €467.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €439.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a recovery of activity in certain Eastern European markets in 2021, which had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the full-year contribution of Cramo in Central Europe in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020). This increase was partially offset by the termination of certain non-core business activities in June 2020 relating to Cramo Germany's sale of new equipment. Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 21.3% to €518.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €427.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in demand for rental services driven by an improvement in general economic conditions, increased demand linked to several large projects in Sweden and the full-year contribution of Cramo in Northern Europe in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020). Revenue generated by the Other Countries region increased by 23.6% to €42.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €34.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a strong recovery in sales in Italy and the United Kingdom, which had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. _Operating Expenses_ Materials and Services Materials and services expenses increased by 18.0% to €477.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €404.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased level of activity in 2021 compared to 2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020). Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense increased by 5.8% to €365.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €345.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020) and a significant increase in temporary staff expenses in 2021 compared to 2020, which had been curtailed from March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.5% to €303.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €298.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020) and increased level of investment activities in the course of 2021. Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Net impairment losses on financial assets decreased by 44% to €3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to provisions recognized in 2020 relating to outstanding receivables of certain Cramo entities acquired in 2020, as well as the improved economic environment in 2021, compared to 2020 which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. _Financial Income and Expense_ Our net financial expense decreased from a net expense of €97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to a net expense of €70.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to certain fees and expenses related to the refinancing of indebtedness incurred to finance the Cramo acquisition and the successful amendment and repricing of the Existing Term Loan B in June 2021. ----- _Income Tax Expense_ Our income tax expense decreased slightly to €21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €22.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, while the result before tax increased significantly. This is primarily due to the recognition in 2021 of certain deferred tax assets for carry forward losses and (non-deductible) interest expense from 2020. _Share of Profit of Joint Venture_ Our share of profit of joint venture was stable over the period, amounting to €1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and €1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. _Profit/(loss) for the year_ As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €80.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a profit of €15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Our management has determined, based on a risk assessment, to hedge some of these currency risks by using certain forward-exchange contracts.

The FY 2022 Financial Statements and HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum were prepared in accordance with IFRS. Certain differences exist between Dutch GAAP and IFRS that may be material to the financial information presented therein. The discussion set forth below summarizes certain differences identified between Dutch GAAP and IFRS as applied by the Group, following a limited analysis of both sets of principles. For additional information on our first-time adoption of IFRS, including reconciliations of certain financial information from Dutch GAAP to IFRS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, see note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements. For a management reconciliation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 from Dutch GAAP to a more comparable basis with our financial information for subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS, see ""—Reconciled Financial _Information"" below.

For additional information, see note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements. - **Goodwill: Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. As a result, we have reversed €46.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2021. See ""—Reconciled Financial _Information"" below for information on the adjustments made for the Reconciled Financial Information_ for 2020. - **Leases: Under IFRS all leases are recognized in the balance sheet except for short term or low value lease contracts. Under Dutch GAAP financial lease contracts are presented ""on-balance"" and the operational lease contracts are presented ""off-balance"". On the transition date (January 1, 2021), we recognized €186.7 million of right of use assets and in total €183.9 million of lease liabilities.

(2) Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. For further information, see ""—Line Item Classification"" below. _Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information_ A. Goodwill Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. The amortization for the period presented has therefore been reversed within profit or loss. The impact is a reversal of €46.7 million amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 presented under depreciation and amortization expenses. B. Leases At the date of transition to IFRS on January 1, 2021, we applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (twelve months or less). As we started accounting under IFRS as of January 1, 2021 for our entities in the Netherlands, we did not have the IFRS 16 accounting tools in place in 2020. In the Nordics (entities acquired in our acquisition of Cramo), IFRS 16 accounting tools were in place in 2020. As a result, for those countries where IFRS 16 accounting tools were not in place in 2020, we have made estimations based on the actual lease expenses in 2020 and the Right of Use starting point at January 1, 2021. The total impact on the profit and loss statement for the ended December 31, 2020 amounts to: - depreciation of right-of-use assets presented under depreciation and amortization expenses of €53.6 million were recognized in 2020; - lease expenses presented under material and services of €55.3 million were reversed in 2020; - lease liabilities interest expenses of €5.3 million presented under finance expense were recognized in 2020; and - the recognition of €0.3 million of revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020 which was presented under revenue. ----- C. Trade and other receivables The adoption of IFRS fundamentally changed our accounting for impairment losses for financial assets by replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forward-looking expected credit loss (""ECL"") approach. IFRS requires us to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and contract assets. We assessed the impact of the change on transition date of January 1, 2021 to be recognized in the statement of profit or loss for 2020 which has led to a decrease in net impairment losses on financial assets in an amount of €1.2 million. D. Revenue Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business are recognized on a net (agent) basis. The application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of revenue on a gross (principal) basis and accordingly an increase in revenue was recognized in the 2020 financial year. We adjusted this by an increase of revenue of €8.5 million and an equivalent decrease in material and services. We also adjusted revenue by €0.3 million for revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020. See ""—B. Leases"" above. E. Deferred tax The various transitional adjustments (leases, trade and other receivables) results in different temporary differences. Deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction in income tax expense. The total adjustment amounts to €0.3 million additional tax expenses in 2020. F. Defined benefit obligations Defined benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS19). The pension expenses in 2020 related to defined benefit plans, which amounted to €0.8 million. This has been adjusted under employee benefits expenses. G. Statement of cash flows Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as cash outflows from financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities increased by €50.1 million and cash outflows from financing activities increased by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2020. _Line Item Classification_ Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements for purposes of the 2020 comparative financial information presented in the FY 2021 Financial Statements. Certain of these line items have been reclassified in this Offering Memorandum to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. The following tables set forth the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and the 2020 comparative financial information included in the FY 2021 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, including certain information with respect to the reclassification of line items to the presentation shown under ""—Reconciled Financial Information"" above.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.1,Overview,521.1.1,,"The equipment rental industry plays a key role in the value chain of significant and economically important endmarkets, including maintenance, infrastructure, construction, energy and energy transition as well as consumer-facing sectors. Equipment rental companies provide customers with a range for products from larger equipment such as aerial work platforms, excavators, earthmoving equipment and forklift trucks, to smaller equipment such as power saws, power generators, scaffolding, ladders, and small pumps. Rental companies are also active in rental markets for containers, sanitation, portable kitchens and trailers. In addition to providing equipment, many rental companies provide holistic support for their customers through a range of services such as maintenance, in-service inspection, repair, transportation, storage, compliance with health and safety regulations, insurance and training on the proper use of the equipment. The provision of holistic support along with equipment rental is becoming increasingly important for rental companies as large end-customers incrementally outsource those previously in-house services. Primary customers typically include engineering, procurement, and construction (""EPC"") contractors, industrial companies, government entities, infrastructure facilitators, utilities, maintenance operators, construction companies as well as homeowners, craftsmen and small and medium-sized enterprises. A large portion of the equipment rental customer base comes from the industrial and the commercial construction sectors. Commercial construction rentals are geared towards contractors conducting new-build and repair and renovation work who rent a wide range of equipment from power tools to backhoes. Industrial rentals are geared towards businesses conducting routine plant maintenance as well as for projects that require specialized tools such as welding equipment, power washing equipment, forklifts and other material handling equipment. Additionally, craftsmen as well as events and media companies have increasingly relied on rental solutions for operational equipment such as power generators, portable toilets and specialized craft equipment.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Customer Value Proposition and Equipment Rental Business Model,521.2.1,,"The long-term growth prospects for the equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, supported by fundamental tailwinds as customers are increasingly renting (i.e., outsourcing) rather than owning operational equipment. The shift to outsourcing is also driven by structural macroeconomic and regulatory factors that increase the attractiveness of renting equipment. The advantages of equipment rental over ownership for companies includes: - **Cost and business flexibility: Equipment rental increases business flexibility by allowing companies to transform fixed costs into variable costs incurred on an as needed basis. In contrast, equipment ownership entails a higher proportion of fixed costs and includes a number of ongoing costs in addition to the cost of initial purchase, such as insurance, maintenance, in service inspection, repair, transportation and storage and depreciation costs, which tend to increase over the life of the equipment. Equipment rental also reduces the amount of capital required in comparison to purchasing equipment, reducing a customer's exposure to credit market conditions and preserving capital for other investments, all of which enables customers to focus on the core parts of their business. - **Equipment access and availability: Equipment rental gives customers access to a comprehensive range of equipment, including the latest generation of technology, allowing them to select the most appropriate piece of equipment for the task at hand, which can improve safety, efficiency and quality. Equipment rental also allows customers to benefit from a number of ancillary services provided by rental companies, including training, safety testing, regulatory compliance, logistical support and consultation on equipment selection. In addition, when renting from rental companies with a large network of branches, customers are able to optimize their logistics flows to and from their worksites. ----- - **Climate change awareness: Rental of equipment is part of the larger developing circular economy, where equipment is rented by many customers over its life cycle allowing for better utilization rates while the rental company maintains control over the equipment's good functioning order through a program of maintenance and regular inspections. Equipment rental allows customers to be a part of this circular economy and reduce their carbon emissions by reducing the overall size of their equipment fleet, limiting their carbon footprint to the use of such equipment only and utilizing newer and more sustainable equipment compared with company-owned equipment. - **Health and safety: Equipment rental generally enhances the operational safety of customers by providing modern, well-serviced equipment. In addition, equipment rental allows customers to more easily benefit from the mechanization and automation of many of their operations, including hazardous tasks, by providing access to and training on specialized equipment, such as power access tools. In the European rental market, the key performance criteria mentioned by rental equipment customers consist of the availability of equipment, equipment quality, location, flexibility, and safety, which can be more important than price in certain markets. Small and medium enterprises (""SME"") tend to place orders via sales representatives or through direct engagement with a depot representative, while medium to large companies are increasingly ordering through online platforms. On average, a majority of rental equipment clients use two or more equipment rental companies primarily as a result of assortment, availability and price differences for each product segment. The economic value-add of a rental equipment provider is derived from the benefit from a lower break-even period and enhanced returns compared to regular equipment purchasers as a result of more efficient fleet utilization, benefit from centralized procurement contracts resulting in lower purchase prices, centralized and lower annual repair and maintenance costs, benefit from higher resale value after the useful life and equipment financing benefits due to economies of scale.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The construction market is composed of three primary subsectors: (i) new residential and non-residential building, (ii) renovation and maintenance, and (iii) infrastructure (which includes transportation infrastructure and telecommunications, as well as energy and water works). While the construction industry as a whole tends to be cyclical, within the overall construction market, individual end markets have differentiated growth patterns and dynamics. For example, the renovation and maintenance end market tends to be less cyclical, as customers tend to reduce or delay new projects in favor of renovation and maintenance work during periods of economic downturns. In addition, construction activity can vary significantly between different regional and local markets, which provides further balance and diversification to demand for rental equipment. In 2022, a majority of the largest European construction markets surveyed by Euroconstruct registered higher than anticipated growth at 3%, within an overall expansionary economic environment. The outlook for the overall European construction market is trending lower in 2023 and 2024, mainly due to a slowdown in the residential sector, with return to growth expected as soon as 2025. However, the maintenance and renovation sectors are expected to grow over the same period due to increase driven by sustainability regulations and energy efficiency measures in a context of high energy prices. This resonates with the recent European Green Deal proposals, with one of the main priorities revolving around ----- renovation, energy efficiency and cleaner energy. This is further supported by local government regulations, notably in the Netherlands' renovation and infrastructure maintenance markets. We have a proven track record of minimizing the impact of economic trends on our business by diversifying our specialist activities across non-construction related niche markets and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction market, such as the fit out, maintain, and operation phases. We also operate in multiple end markets in various countries, which enhances our resilience and reduces our exposure to market volatility, macroeconomic developments and specific events. Approximately 54% of our sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 come from non-construction customers, indicating relatively modest exposure to the construction sector's cyclical volatility. Furthermore, our exposure to the construction end-market includes a large part of less cyclical businesses such as fit out, maintain and operation, which account for more than half of the construction-related sales. Urbanization Urbanization is a key driver of demand for rental services, as the population shift towards cities increases the need for infrastructure development and maintenance. This leads to higher expenditures on large infrastructure projects, which typically require a wide range of equipment and tools that are more cost-effective and convenient to rent than to buy.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The rental penetration rate varies across countries, with Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, France, Denmark and the UK being relatively the most mature markets, and Eastern European countries having lower rental penetration rates, which offer significant growth potential. Increased benefits of rental versus ownership One of the key drivers for the increase in rental penetration rates is the enhanced value proposition of renting compared to owning equipment. Renting equipment offers access to modern equipment, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, as it reduces capital expenditure requirements, fixed costs of ownership, and residual value risk, while allowing customers to adapt to changing demand and project requirements. Moreover, large rental companies can leverage their scale and expertise in purchasing, maintenance, and repair of equipment, offering a competitive advantage over smaller companies that lack the financial resources for large fleet investments. Renting equipment also becomes more attractive for customers in an uncertain or declining economic environment, as customers in general prefer to opt for flexibility and avoid the burden of ownership and opt for more flexible and variable solutions. Decarbonization and ESG initiatives Another key driver for the increase in rental penetration rates is the growing pressure to decarbonize and adopt ESG initiatives across various industries. Renting equipment is inherently part of the circular economy, as it maximizes the utilization and lifespan of equipment, while ensuring its proper functioning and safety through regular maintenance and inspections. Renting also reduces the operational complexity and waste associated with owning equipment, as it requires fewer procurement, logistics, and disposal activities, while optimizing the carbon footprint. For instance, the building and construction industry, which is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, can benefit from renting more energyefficient and ESG-friendly equipment from rental companies. As market participants require more energy efficient and sustainable equipment, they are expected to rely more heavily on rental companies to provide the latest generation of equipment. Growing demand for digital solutions and add-on services Rental penetration rates are expected to be driven by the rising demand for digital solutions and add-on services that complement and enhance the rental offer and customer experience. Digitalization and technological advances enable rental companies to provide more value-added services, such as fleet management, route optimization, environmental reporting, online ordering and billing, which increase efficiency, transparency, and convenience for customers. Customers also expect more instant and easy access to information and offerings, price comparison, and online reviews, which rental companies can leverage to differentiate themselves and build loyalty. We have invested heavily in our digital capabilities and platforms to offer a seamless and customer-centric service across our markets and segments. Increasing preference for end-to-end proposition Growth in rental penetration rates is also expected to be driven by changing customer preferences for end-to-end propositions that provide turnkey solutions for their broader needs and project success, rather than just equipment or ----- services for specific tasks. Customers seek more comprehensive and integrated solutions that cover the entire value chain and offer a degree of flexibility and customization. Rental companies can respond to this demand by offering and providing packaged solutions that include a full range of equipment and services, such as planning, installation, operation, and maintenance that are tailored to the specific requirements and objectives of each customer and project. For example, we have provided full turnkey solutions for an automotive gigafactory in Berlin-Brandenburg by supplying a full range of equipment and services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

As a result, the industry has experienced a high degree of consolidation in recent years. For example, we have completed 27 acquisitions since 2012, including the transformational acquisition of Cramo in 2020. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, as illustrated by the chart below. We compete primarily with large national and international equipment providers that offer broad, generalized product ranges to customers. These include Loxam/Ramirent, and Kiloutou, both of which have a strong presence in France. In contrast to our largest competitors which have a higher focus on heavy equipment required in the new building phases, our business model focuses more on lighter equipment used in the subsequent fit out, maintain and operate phase (post-heavy equipment phase), resulting in less cyclical end-markets with higher degree of flexibility in equipment allocation and utilization. Post-heavy construction phases tend to be more diverse in terms of workload and therefore provide a greater opportunity to differentiate the product and service offering, including potential for ongoing service elements. We believe we have strong market positions across our main markets. We believe we have the largest market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of 2530% in the Netherlands, in Belgium an estimated market share of approximately 10%, and an estimated market share of close to 20% in Sweden. We believe we have the second largest market share in Germany and Finland in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of 5-10% in Germany and more than 15% in Finland.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the German rental market is expected to reach a total size of approximately €5.0 billion in 2022, an increase of approximately 2.0% compared to 2021, and based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by approximately 4.3% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. Demand in the construction sector accounts for approximately 65% of the total market sales. The German rental industry, Europe's second largest market after France, is characterized by a fragmented and diversified competitive landscape consisting of a number of international and regional players with a strong local customer base. We believe we are the second largest player in the market, with an estimated 5-10% market share based on 2022 revenue, with the largest player, Zeppelin, mainly focused on earthmoving equipment. Other large players include, HKL and Mateco. Recently, foreign players including Kiloutou and Riwal entered the German market through acquisitions but are still relatively small. German customer demand tends to be sophisticated in terms of higher focus on innovation, service offering and quality, illustrated by an increasing demand for on-site services such as temporary traffic management, onsite power and water, safety management, and site access control. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these factors with our strong services, network density and fleet offering, which include a wide range of equipment, from small tools to large machines, as well as specialized solutions for specific sectors and projects. The growth potential in Germany is significant and is expected to be primarily driven by two factors: increasing penetration of rental equipment and fundamental growth in infrastructure and energy sector in the mid-to-long term. In particular, the infrastructure and energy sector is expected to benefit from strong demand for infrastructure projects, especially within highways and bridges, which require substantial maintenance and modernization. In addition, the energy sector is expected to provide further growth, particularly as coal energy production is set to end by 2037, which necessitates structural changes to Germany's current energy infrastructure, a trend which is also expected for other major European countries. Additional key trends in the German rental market that are expected to shape the industry dynamics and performance in the coming years include (i) further consolidation of the fragmented market, as larger players seek to gain scale and market share through acquisitions and partnerships, (ii) a focus on decarbonization of construction sites, leading to increased demand for newer and more efficient equipment, (iii) substantial government expenditures on large infrastructure projects, aimed at addressing a backlog of civil engineering projects (roads, bridges, rail) as well as investments in 5G infrastructure and energy transition as a result of policies to increase renewable energy sources, and (iv) increasing demand for one-stop-shop offering, over pure specialist rental companies, as customers seek to simplify their procurement processes and benefit from a broader range of equipment and services from a single provider. _The Netherlands_ The following table sets forth the market turnover growth rate for the Netherlands for the periods indicated. ----- The Netherlands ................................................

The Dutch equipment rental market is a sizable and growing sector, with an estimated value of approximately €1.2 billion in turnover in 2022 according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. The market is forecast to grow at a rate of approximately 2.4% in 2023 and accelerate to approximately 4.0% in 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report. The growth prospects are supported by the ongoing and planned investment in various segments of infrastructure, environment, and new technologies, with a focus on enhancing energy efficiency and security in the country. The Dutch rental industry is characterized by a relatively high degree of consolidation, with a dominant player and a few large competitors, followed by a number of smaller and more specialized or local providers. We believe we are the market leader in the Dutch rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of approximately 25-30%. Although not directly comparable, other large players in the market include Collé, Loxam, Mateco, Peinemann and Riwal. Smaller rental companies, with less than 50 employees, account for approximately 41% of the total market sales, reflecting the fragmentation of the market. Key trends in the Dutch rental market include: (i) consolidation, with smaller challengers being acquired by established players, (ii) increasing demand for DIY and rental of small equipment, driven by a growing number of independent craftsmen who prefer to rent rather than buy equipment for their projects, (iii) growing demand for digitalization of products and services offering, with currently low penetration of digital solutions as well as packaged services, (iv) increasing focus on emission and more hybrid solutions for rental equipment, due to stricter government regulations and environmental standards that require more energy-efficient and less polluting equipment, and (v) increase of maintenance and repair of infrastructure, with the recent Dutch government's announcement to address a number of repair issues in the existing roads and bridges. _Sweden_ The following table sets forth the market turnover growth rate for Sweden for the periods indicated.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Swedish rental market has an estimated value of SEK17.9 billion in turnover in 2022 and is forecast to grow by approximately 1.0% in 2023, accelerating to approximately 3.7% in 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report. Demand in the construction sector accounted for approximately 70% of the total market sales in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. We believe we have the second largest market position in the Swedish rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of close to 20%. Other major competitors include Ramirent/Loxam and Renta. Compared to other European countries, the Swedish rental market is mature and has a high rental penetration rate, meaning that a large proportion of construction equipment is rented rather than owned. In the medium to long term, the market is expected to benefit from the structural trends of public investment in greener iron, steel and battery production, as well as the shift to renewable power generation from wind and solar sources. Sweden has one of the highest rental GDP and construction sector penetration in Europe, as well as high standards for safety, quality, and environmental performance. Customers are increasingly demanding end-to-end rental solutions that cover not only the equipment, but also the ancillary services such as on-site traffic management, waste management, and safety solutions. Moreover, there is a strong demand for modern and safer machines that have a lower environmental footprint, as the market is moving towards decarbonization and sustainability. _Finland_ The following table sets forth the market turnover growth rate for Finland for the periods indicated. ----- Finland .................................................................. (5.1)% 2.3% 6.8% 5.2% 4.2% Source: 2021 and 2022 based on ERA 2022 Market Report; 2023 and 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Finnish equipment rental market has an estimated value of approximately €0.7 billion in turnover in 2022 and, based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by approximately 5.2% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024. Demand in the construction sector accounted for approximately 70% of the total market sales in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. The construction market saw significant growth in 2022, reflecting positive developments in infrastructure and non-residential projects. The market outlook for the medium term is favorable, as the rental penetration rate and the outsourcing trend from ownership to rental are expected to increase further in the coming years. The competitive landscape of the Finnish rental market has historically been dominated by two local major players, Loxam/Ramirent and Boels/Cramo. However, the market has recently witnessed the emergence of Renta as a new player, driving up investments and increasing competition through consolidation with small players. The market is also characterized by a large number of smaller companies (with 1-49 employees), which generated approximately 63% of the total industry revenue, and large firms (with over 250 employees), which generated approximately 37% of total industry revenue according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. Merger and acquisition activity in the Finnish rental market has been relatively stable, especially compared to the neighboring markets of Norway and Sweden, which have seen more consolidation in recent years. The investment level in the market is high, as companies seek to renew their fleet and add more sustainable fleet options, as demand for equipment such as crane equipment and electric machinery increases. The demand for greener equipment is supported by investment from the public sector. Key trends that shape the Finnish rental market include: (i) a growing demand for add-on or packaged services, (ii) an increasing focus on digitalization with connected fleet and digital services, (iii) a rising focus on decarbonization and greener solutions following Finnish regulations aimed at reducing the emissions of the sector, and (iv) a geographical polarization, with construction and equipment rental market concentrated in the main urban areas. _Belgium_ The following table sets forth the market turnover growth rate for Belgium for the periods indicated. Belgium ................................................................ (8.8)% 3.7% 3.6% 4.1% 5.0% Source: 2021 and 2022 based on ERA 2022 Market Report; 2023 and 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Belgian equipment rental market has an estimated value of approximately €0.7 billion in turnover in 2022 and, based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by approximately 4.1% in 2023 and 5.0% in 2024 as construction activity is projected to improve. The rental companies in Belgium have benefited from the strong recovery of the rental demand, which has resulted in full order books through mid-2023. As the rental volume growth normalizes in the medium term, increasing rental penetration rates are expected to drive further growth in the industry. The Belgian rental industry is characterized by a high level of fragmentation, whereby only a few rental companies have national coverage, caused by the regional split between Flanders and Wallonia and the related language differences. Generally, Flanders tends to have more specialized rental companies that are oriented towards the non-construction sector, while Wallonia tends to have more generalist rental companies that are focused on the construction sector. This is a distinctive feature of the Belgian market compared with other European markets (except for Switzerland) and has not significantly changed in the recent years. Given that most rental players are local rather than national, the language barrier increases the barriers to entry for new domestic or foreign players, as they need to adapt to the different customer needs in each region. We are one of the few players with nation-wide coverage in Belgium and we believe we have the largest market position in the Belgian rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of approximately 10%. ----- Other large players in the market include Loxam and TVH. Small rental companies (less than 50 employees) contributed approximately 75% to the total market sales in Belgium in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, although investment levels were flat in 2022 compared to 2021, Belgian rental companies are renewing their fleet and adding new machinery as market demand is trending higher for smaller machines, access equipment and platforms. The transition to hybrid machinery or battery powered equipment has resulted in increased demand, but this is still slow and not expected to materialize meaningfully in the short-term. However, in the longer term, environmental regulations and customer awareness of environmental issues are expected to drive a more significant increase in demand. Additionally, outside the construction and industrial sectors, there has been a substantial increase in rental demand in the Belgian events sector. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe, for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer ""do-it-yourself"" (""DIY"") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training courses, project management and emergency assistance. In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions: - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023; and - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue (representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, in six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8 ""Operating Segments"" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see ""Presentation of Financial _Information—Operating Segments.""_ ----- We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group, is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020. We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements. Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996, we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs. The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers' industries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Competitive Strengths,212.2.1,Leading market positions in a large and growing European market supported by favorable underlying growth drivers,"We have grown significantly since our founding in 1977 as a local rental company. Since then, we have grown into a multinational company through a combination of organic growth and transformative and bolt-on acquisitions. With the Cramo acquisition in 2020, which allowed us to expand our operations in the Nordics and Baltics while strengthening our network in Western and Central Europe, we have created a true pan-European rental equipment player with increased scale and resilience. We believe that our current footprint provides us with beneficial scale in strong and growing geographic and customer end-markets. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental business in Europe by rental revenue in 2022. As of June 30, 2023, we operate a comprehensive depot network of 759 depots, comprising 681 general rental depots and 78 specialist rental depots. We believe that our scale is particularly important as a provider of rental equipment, because it helps us optimize fleet utilization rates through our ability to easily relocate units to areas with higher demand for specific types of equipment and provides us with additional bargaining power in negotiations with OEMs and equipment suppliers and maintenance partners. We believe that our scale and our market leadership also help to increase our brand recognition and affords us with greater opportunities to attract and retain talented and experienced personnel. In the Netherlands, which is historically our cornerstone market, we believe that we hold a strong leader position with between 25% and 30% of market share based on revenue in 2022, which we believe is significantly ahead of our competitors. We believe we are also the leader in Belgium with approximately 10% of market share and the second-largest player in Germany with between 5% and 10% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. With the acquisition of Cramo in 2020, we expanded our presence into five more European markets (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania) and significantly strengthened our position in six European countries where Boels and Cramo had a joint presence. We believe that we are the second largest player in Sweden, with close to 20% of market share, and in Finland, with more than 15% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. ----- We believe that the markets we address are strong and poised for further growth. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the total market size of the top 15 European rental equipment markets is estimated to have increased by 4% from €24.7 billion in 2021 to €25.7 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow by 3.3% in 2023 and 5.6% in 2024. According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the European market is expected to remain strong, driven by an increased rental penetration and a structural shift in customers' preferences towards renting rather than owning equipment. This shift is supported by the attractiveness and flexibility offered by renting, as it optimizes the split between operating costs and capital expenditures by reducing the fixed portion of maintenance and fleet replacement costs and allows customers to avoid investing in expensive equipment that may not be used frequently. Moreover, the transition to achieving net zero CO2 emissions amplifies this effect, as electric equipment is generally more expensive. This structural shift is expected to support continued demand for rental equipment companies' products and services over the medium and long term. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from growth and positive trends in the equipment rental industry. The European rental equipment industry is still highly fragmented, consisting of a large number of small companies serving local or regional markets, with a limited number of medium to larger companies serving regional, national and international customers. We believe we are one of only a few companies with a strong pan-European platform, with strong relationships with the key equipment OEMs. We compete with a large number of smaller competitors locally and a few larger international competitors. We believe that we are well-positioned for growth by leveraging our scale and footprint, while relying on our proven approach of customizing our strategy for each local market, while centralizing our key operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Competitive Strengths,212.2.2,"Resilient business model supported by robust diversification across geographies, end markets, products and customers, supported by a notable depot network","We strive to minimize the impact of economic cycles through continually maximizing our rental fleet utilization rate, developing specialist activities focused on non-construction related niche markets, diversifying our customer base by investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction related customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction projects. We have a diversified footprint and address several different customer end-markets, helping to mitigate our exposure to macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, with the acquisition of Cramo, we significantly increased our geographical diversification, bringing our revenue generated in the Netherlands to 24% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, compared to nearly half of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Moreover, no single country represented more than 25% of our revenue generation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We believe that this enhanced geographic diversification gives us greater resilience during periods of slow economic growth, as different countries operate within different economic cycles. Based on our revenue and EBITDA growth, we believe we outperformed our largest European competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving the resilience of our business model. The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We address multiple customer end markets, which also contributes to our resilience in reducing the impact of volatility of external factors such as market conditions and macroeconomic developments. We have positioned ourselves as a leading generalist equipment rental company that is also active in the attractive specialist sub-segment and in DIY, with specialist rental and DIY representing 28% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 54% of our sales were derived from non-construction end-markets, indicating a relatively modest exposure to the cyclical construction market. Furthermore, our exposure to the construction end market includes a large part of less cyclical phases of construction activities, such as the fit out, maintenance and operational phases. The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by end markets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. ----- Over time, we have continued developing our expertise in specialist rental equipment, focusing on nonconstruction related end-markets, such as site preparation, modular space, measurement, testing and safety, sanitation, portable kitchen, hoisting and lifting, access control, and industrial rental and pumps. We believe our specialized knowledge is key to our ability to service different niche markets, providing further resilience and less exposure to the more cyclical construction market. By leveraging our generalist rental equipment business, we also aim to provide the best and most comprehensive rental solutions for our customers with the objective of cross-selling our specialist equipment to fuel future growth. Ultimately, our specialist business represents a key peer differentiator with customers, which we believe provides for higher returns. In parallel, we also operate in the niche market of DIY rental, with more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops as at June 30, 2023, where customers at DIY retail stores have access to primarily smaller equipment rental such as tools. This type of business is less cyclical than traditional equipment rental market and the costs to operate this business are typically lower than other equipment rental businesses due to the strong operational leverage of the existing rental depot network. In the DIY market, we are able to offer convenience as a differentiating factor to our customers, generating higher customer foot traffic in the stores, at a time when e-commerce is putting a strain on retailers and brick-and-mortar stores. We strive to offer a wide range of equipment and tools across all the phases of construction projects, including the build (both heavy construction and fit out), operate and maintain phases. Our business model also hinges on providing a diversified range of products to our customers. We particularly focus on smaller equipment rentals, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, which represented approximately 48% of our rental revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. These rentals position us within the less-cyclical 'fit out', 'maintain' and 'operate' phases of the asset cycle, as demand for such rentals is typically more resilient and makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects. For example, smaller equipment rentals tend to be more sought after for renovation and maintenance use, which are inherently less exposed to cyclical demand than other end uses. As of June 30, 2023, with a fleet of approximately 860,000 equipment units, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment, in addition to value-added services such as logistics, we aim to provide full turnkey solutions to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner. Furthermore, with a comprehensive network of 759 depots (strategically located within a 50-kilometer reach of our key customers and project sites across Europe) and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30, 2023, we are capable of mobilizing our rental fleet even in remote places for any customer or user at the right time, through multiple delivery methods: pick up and return or delivery to desired locations. By constantly adapting our network to changes and fluctuations in the market, we have the strategic ability to open or close access points near our customers. Based on market trends or developments in specific regions in Europe, we can adapt swiftly and embrace changes in our industry. Our hub-and-spoke networking model provides a diversified customer reach and develops efficiency and flexibility in our operations, ensuring that we are close to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return or project delivery. This proximity to our customers results in shorter transport times, lower costs and lower CO2 emissions. Supported by our broad product offering and dense network, we also benefit from a large and diversified customer base, serving numerous customers of different sizes and from different sectors through our various channels (both generalist and specialist rental products) ranging from DIY customers, cash customers and craftsmen to large industrial, services and construction companies, potentially operating in different economic cycles. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 7.4% of our revenue, with no single customer representing more than 2% of our revenue. We benefit from strong customer loyalty, evidenced by the fact that our 10 largest customers by revenue have, on average, an approximately 20-year relationship with us. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Competitive Strengths,212.2.3,Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust fleet management and digital capabilities,"We differentiate our offering from most of our peers by focusing on smaller rental items, such as tools and access equipment, in addition to construction equipment and containers. The chart below shows our revenue breakdown by product category for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Over the last five years, we have invested more than €1.4 billion to renew our rental fleet, with €448 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a young, well-invested fleet with a historical purchase value of approximately €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023. These investments have reduced the weighted average age of our fleet to 53 months as of June 30, 2023, allowing us to offer our customers the latest advanced equipment and sufficient headroom to reduce or delay our capital expenditures during economic downturns. The chart below shows our rental equipment fleet's average useful life and its age (in months), by product category, as of June 30, 2023. Our tools product category, which amounted to 16% of our rental sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, has the lowest spread between average useful life and average fleet age in our fleet, with an average of approximately 3.5 years of use remaining before ultimately needing to be replaced. Our smaller equipment, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, and other small tools, are characterized by superior unit economics compared to our other product categories, as they lead to higher money utilization rates (defined as our twelve-month fleet sales divided by the historical purchase price, based on the weighted average price by number of rental units). For the year ended December 31, 2022, our money utilization rate for the tools and light equipment product category was higher than our larger product categories, such as construction equipment, which we believe results in an increase in our return on fleet investments and an increase in our resilience through business cycles, given our high exposure to the tools and light equipment category. The chart below shows our money utilization rate for our different types of rental equipment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. ----- Our focus on tools and access equipment makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects and more exposed to the less cyclical renovation market, where we have a better pricing power among our smaller customers. On our major long-term projects, we often provide a full range of equipment from small hand-held tools to larger equipment, reflecting our ability to support our clients on their various steps and needs with adequate and available equipment. This ability to provide full range of equipment in due time ultimately fosters relationships with our clients, creating recurring revenue streams and the potential for cross-selling between our generalist and specialist equipment. We have developed a robust asset management strategy for our extensive fleet. Our fleet management strategy covers the entire lifecycle of our equipment units, which includes purchasing, renting, and equipment servicing, as well as reselling the equipment at the end of its financial or economic lifetime. When making purchasing decisions, we seek to provide a true one-stop shop experience for our customers by ensuring a high degree of availability across our entire rental range and equipment that is adapted to their needs. By closely monitoring trends, events and market prices, we can quickly adjust and adapt our offer to customers' needs. For example, the share of Eco-labelled equipment in our fleet is relatively high and growing in line with higher market demand for electrical, hybrid or battery-powered equipment and the highest sustainability standards. Simultaneously, we seek time- and cost-efficiency to maximize our economies of scale and fleet occupancy performance. These initiatives improve our fleet availability and utilization rates while minimizing our maintenance capital expenditures. We have implemented an advanced and integrated infrastructure to drive decision making for our fleet, such as enterprise resource planning and specialized hardware and software. This asset management system allows us to track the complete life cycle of any rental asset in our fleet, providing us with visibility on our any given item (such as depot performance, inventory levels, fleet allocation and pricing) and the ability to adjust our fleet investment and pricing. This enables us able to serve our customers according to their needs, quickly and efficiently. In addition, this system makes it possible to limit downtime and improve utilization rates and pricing. Finally, as a piece of our equipment reaches the end of its lifecycle within the Company, we believe that we are able to optimize the timing of its resale and maximize its resale value through closely following secondary market prices and trends and taking third-party insights into account. Our fleet management strategy also relies on a central procurement strategy. This enables us to benefit from economies of scale and allows us to be close to our OEMs and their product development, positioning us at the forefront for the latest products in terms of efficiency, safety and sustainability. In addition, our relationships with OEMs not only allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. We also foster our relationships with our OEMs by collaborating on technological developments and data analyses, and we aim to deepen our cooperation with them further. In addition, we have invested and continue to invest in the latest technology to help us efficiently process our fleet maintenance and repairs and minimize our related costs and administrative workload. These technological capabilities allow us to be in full control of depreciation and replacement strategies and therefore systematically improve our fleet usage, composition and performance. We monitor and reduce the impact machine repairs and maintenance have on lifetime costs and resale value. Finally, we seek to be a leader in innovation and digital transformation across the entire rental process, which we believe results in higher customer satisfaction and percentage of recurring business, better fleet damage control and substantial emissions savings. We were an early adopter of digital offerings in the European rental market, having anticipated this trend by preparing a detailed mapping of our customer experiences per segment, with the aim to simplify online rental in all our customer's life cycle stages and provide a one-stop-shop solution: from becoming a customer to online renting, logistics, usage, having all relevant information available and invoicing. In parallel, this digital transformation generates operational efficiencies by allowing us to optimize our processes such as transport and logistics. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Since our foundation more than 45 years ago, we have been focused on increasing scale and achieving sales growth. Our business model is based on actively distributing our fleet through our depot network, directly competing with local players and ultimately winning market share by providing newer equipment and better customer service. This model has delivered a proven track record of strong growth over the past decade. Between 2012 and 2022, our revenue grew at a CAGR of approximately 19%, significantly exceeding the growth of the economy, the construction market and the equipment rental market over the same period in Europe. While delivering robust sales growth, we have also managed to retain steady and high margins, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

Revenue for 2019 has been prepared solely for illustrative purposes based on management estimates utilizing a simple aggregation of the revenue of Cramo and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have the ability to actively manage our fleet investment based on existing market conditions and the stage of the industry cycle, which has contributed to our counter-cyclical cash generation. In an industry growth cycle, we invest in our rental fleet to enhance our product catalogue and expand into new products and markets. In a downturn, with our newly invested young fleet, we can rapidly reduce our capital expenditures and postpone our investments, streamline our depot network and the size of the fleet, and pay down debt with our strong cash flows resulting from lower capital expenditures. Our business has flexibility to make investment decisions on a regular, short-term basis, and has no long-term expansionary capital expenditures commitments. Therefore, we are generally able to quickly adjust our fleet investments to respond to the changing market environment. For example, recently, we were able to quickly adapt our investments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on maintaining our existing fleet through reduced capital expenditures. After the stabilization of market conditions in 2021, we resumed our investments by increasing our capital expenditures. ----- The countercyclical nature of cash generation and our ability to adjust our capital expenditure while preserving our cash generation through the cycles supports our conservative leverage policy and enables us to deleverage during challenging economic periods, as we did during the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, the double dip recession, and more recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The members of our management are further supported by divisional and regional managers in an organizational structure that empowers entrepreneurship spirit and decision making. Jan Piet Valk, our Chief Financial Officer since 2020 and member of our Management Board, has acquired a proven international experience through his previous chief financial officer positions. He is responsible for the overall financial management, M&A strategy, health and safety policy, legal, treasury, sustainability and real estate matters and is involved in all key decisions in the company. Mr. Valk has recently been awarded ""CFO of the Year"" by Financieel Management, in recognition of his independent role in the leadership of our Group, his management skills and his board position. Under Mr. Pierre Boels Jr.'s leadership, we managed to significantly increase our sales and EBITDA, both organically and through acquisitions, having successfully executed and integrated 27 acquisitions since 2012. Our CEO has assembled an experienced management team with significant industry expertise, including: - Reiant Mulder, Chief Operations Officer of Central Europe and member of our Strategic Board with more than 20 years of services experience. - Guy Cremer, Chief Procurement Officer, working with us since 1989 and leading in the Fleet Management department since 2000. Additionally, Mr. Cremer was recognized with the award for ""Rental person of the year"" by ERA in June 2023 for his influential role in the shift towards lower carbon emission equipment last year; and - Martin Holmgren: Chief Operations Officer of Nordics and a member of our Strategic Board. Mr. Holmgren is also Vice President of ERA and has worked for almost 30 years in the construction and rental industry. Our highly qualified senior management team is in close contact with our local business directors, since investment decisions strongly benefit from local market knowledge. For example, the choice between opening a greenfield location when expanding into a new region or acquiring an established company in the region is based on local insights about rental company concentration provided by local business leaders: we consider acquisitions when rental concentration is high and greenfield expansion in locations where rental concentration is low.

We have set ambitious CSR targets to position ourselves as a front runner in the development of a safe and environmentally friendly business and a key partner to our customers in meeting their increasing needs and demands for more sustainable solutions. We believe that the core purpose of rental, compared to ownership, is the achievement of the efficient use of equipment and materials, therefore making a positive contribution to the circular economy. According to a research study ----- led by ERA, efficient use of equipment results in a reduction of approximately 30% to 50% of CO2 emissions (depending on specific user practice) and that the rental business model stimulates such efficient use. Our rental concept allows our customers and their end-customers to meet their objectives and targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality, safety and to reduce their carbon footprint. CSR topics are at the heart of our business model. We also chose to apply the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 (""GRI 2021"") Standards and Disclosures to report our sustainability-related data, to commit to the guidelines of UN Global Compact and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals relevant to our business. In addition, based on a formal materiality assessment, we have identified four focus areas covering all aspects of corporate and social responsibility, including Employee Care, Social Care, Customer Care and Environmental Care. We have also identified, key performance indicators in relation to each topic and set ambitious targets for 2025. We aim to be the leader in sustainable fleet investments, to enable our customers in executing their projects with the lowest level of emissions, while continuing to deliver profitable growth. Our Green Team, which includes members from our fleet, sales and marketing departments, has jointly set out a strategy to invest in anticipation of customer needs and develop ambitious and innovative solutions (including zero emission equipment) in their field. For our fleet, we invest in energy-efficient products to improve our energy performance. For example, our fleet includes electrical two-ton excavators, fully battery-operated six-meter telehandlers and over two-ton electric-wheeled loaders. We also have a wide availability of battery packs and have created solar panel roofs for site huts and new zero emission welfare units, which were both brought to market in 2022. Additionally, our fleet contains more than 1,000 Stage V engines meeting the EU standard for non-road machines with low emissions of particulate matter.

Acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy that we pursue either for geographical expansion (filling in gaps in our existing footprint), increase market share, acquire specialist knowledge, improve our competitive position, or acquire certain assets. We have a clear, defined and well-established acquisitions strategy with a dedicated integration team in place. The success of our international expansion and our ability to effectively integrate acquired companies is demonstrated by our track record of 27 successful acquisitions since 2012. In particular, we demonstrated our disciplined M&A strategy and execution with our transformative acquisition of Cramo in 2020. During the 6 months of the initial integration period, our management executed a clear integration plan to minimize execution risk related to the acquisition, while maintaining a high quality service for our customers and efficiently responding to their needs. In countries where Boels and Cramo had geographic overlap, such as in Germany, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, we focused our efforts on optimizing our depot network, rebranding and refurbishing Cramo's depots in Central Europe (including Germany), enhancing our cross-selling opportunities and optimizing our back-office functions. We also invested substantially in integrating the fleets in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, increasing the availability of fleet and our flexibility, allowing us to optimize our response to market demands. In 2021 and 2022, we invested in and deployed new equipment categories that meet specific local requirements as a result of our analyses of the local markets, in order to be less dependent on large projects, with the aim to reach small and medium enterprises and retail clients. As a result of such efforts, we were able to successfully integrate our Central European operations in only 10 months and achieved synergies in terms of centralization of our mutual best practices in our key operations: IT, finance, fleet management and human resources through the deployment of our One Boels strategy. As a result of these efforts, we believe we have realized significant synergies, which generate recurring savings in EBITDA and capital expenditures, ----- primarily due to the optimization of our procurement functions, the consolidation of our IT systems and the reduction of our corporate expenses (including as a result of the closing of Cramo's headquarters in Finland). We believe that our acquisition track record, including our ability to integrate companies, positions us for growth while strengthening our local presence. The success of our international expansion supports our financial and operational development and establishes us as a market consolidator in a fragmented equipment rental industry.

We also continuously work to mitigate our own climate impact by reducing energy consumption, increasing the use of renewable energy and increasing circularity of our products and operations. We reduce, reuse or recycle materials, reduce waste and handle hazardous waste properly. For facilities and installations, we invest in energy efficient products, services and design for energy performance improvement. For example, we have been increasing our energy efficiency while reducing our emissions through investments in sustainable technologies and services, LED lighting, solar panels, ----- better insulation or development of energy management systems. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our energy use relative to sales by 12%, compared to 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our gas usage by 28% to 8,900 MWh compared to 2021, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,670 tCO2 of our emissions.

We also disclose the Group's greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) with clear reduction targets. In 2022, we announced a number of targets with respect to our carbon emissions for 2025, using 2021 as a baseline, including: - reduce our emissions (calculated in tCO2) relative to sales (Scope 1 and 2) by 20%; - reduce our energy use relative to sales (Scope 1 (direct energy use) and Scope 2 (purchased energy)) by 15%; and - increase our share of renewable electricity to above 92% (compared to 56% in 2022 and 49% in 2021).

We believe that we are well-positioned to become the leading partner of our customers in all the geographies we serve. We believe that our customers already recognize us as a preferred one-stop-shop for their rental needs, primarily due to our diversification across products, end markets, general and specialist rental, and our strong European geographic coverage. Our acquisition of Cramo has demonstrated our ambition to keep strengthening and expanding our geographic coverage and diversifying our service offering. We believe we can achieve a leading position in our markets through our strong, long-term partnerships with our customers. In order to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner, we aim to provide full turn-key solutions, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment (including site huts, site safes, traffic sets and sanitation), in addition to value-added services such as logistics.

We have developed and deployed new types of data- and connectivity-based solutions to connect our people, internal processes and fleet to our customers, such as our new smart application for mobile devices, ""Equipment Pool"", which improves customers' access to equipment and machines, while reducing transportation times to and from customers' construction sites . We believe that we can leverage our digital processes and use of data in a customer-focused manner in order to improve communication between our employees and our customers, better identify customers' needs and facilitate interactions and transactions with customers. Although we already have improved processes and digital tools in place to optimize our customers' experience, we intend to continue enhancing our rental websites, including those of Cramo, Boels Rental and IQ Pass, to add further equipment data and specifications and combine our general and specialist rental fleet in a single platform. We believe that such technological capabilities positions us to achieve the full potential of our one-stop-shop solutions. We also intend to continue leveraging digital tools to streamline and boost efficiency in our internal systems. For example, we have implemented a single group-wide financial system to monitor our cash flows and key performance indicators.

In 1980, we opened our first formal office in Sittard, and in the 1990s, we expanded to Belgium and Germany and began supplying mobile kitchens and in-shop rental points in DIY stores. As we continued on our trajectory of organic growth and expansion, Pierre Boels Jr. became CEO in 1996 and implemented our European growth strategy. In 2000, we commenced a full-service offering with OneCall, which provides customers with a single point of contact for their rental needs. We celebrated 25 years in business in 2002 with 650 employees and 65 depots in three countries. In 2004, we opened our 100th depot. During the early 2000s, we strategically expanded into countries and activities that were complementary to our original footprint and product and service base. In 2007, we commenced operations in Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, and at the end of 2011, we acquired Baurent Baumaschinen Miet-Service GmbH, a construction machinery and equipment rental company, expanding our presence in Germany. In 2015, we acquired leading specialist companies in climate and energy rental, shop-in-shop rental and earthmoving equipment. In 2017 we opened our 400[th] depot. In 2017 and 2018, we completed additional strategic acquisitions in the United Kingdom, while also adding to our industrial rental operation by acquiring Abird. The year 2020 marked an important point in our history, where our fleet exceeded the €2.0 billion purchase value mark for the first time reflecting both our organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe we became the second largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, all within 50 years of selling our first product, an 11-kilo breaker. That year, we acquired the listed Finnish rental company Cramo, integrating the five Central European countries where Cramo's presence overlapped with Boels and raising the overall number of countries in which we operated in to 18. In 2021, we launched our sustainability motto ""Orange is the new green,"" highlighting our commitment to assisting our customers in building and working with lower emissions. In 2022, we acquired Eekels Pompen, a Dutch specialist pump company, expanding our product portfolio. That same year, we launched our One Boels program to integrate overhead activities, such as finance, HR, fleet management and IT throughout our entire network into the Boels organization.

Regardless of their size or industry, many of our customers have time-sensitive and complex projects, and we believe that our vast network of depots and wide range of general and specialist offerings allow us to meet our clients' needs.

As of June 30, 2023, our fleet is comprised of approximately 39% tools, 27% energy and climate, 13% material handling, 11% site huts and site preparation, 5% earthmoving and 4% access equipment. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €813 million in rental revenue from our fleet only (excluding revenue on fleet items), of which tools and light equipment generated 48% (comprised of tools generating 16%, ----- material handling generating 12% and energy and climate generating 20%), access equipment generated 25%, earthmoving generated 13% and site huts and site preparation 14%. With the goal of providing the European market with the best and latest equipment, we aim to invest strategically in high-quality equipment that adheres to strict environmental and safety performance standards. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, investments in our fleet increased the number of serialized rental items by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, reflecting a broadening our existing assortment and our continued investment in the Eco-label fleet to meet higher market demands for electrical, hybrid and battery-powered equipment with high sustainability standards. We have continued to expand our fleet to include Eco-Label, Zero Emission, and ZeroEmission Evolution offerings. Machines and tools with the Eco-Label are less harmful to the environments in which they operate in terms of emissions, vibrations and noise. As a result, they are better for the health of the user and local residents. Zero Emission machines and tools that are manufactured to not emit carbon dioxide and Zero-Emission Evolution machines and tools are those which we believe are at the forefront of technical development and make a larger impact in reducing our customers environmental footprint. Examples of these include larger telehandlers, certain types of dumpers, and 4x4 heavy terrain scissor lifts. For a further discussion of our fleet management investment decisions, see ""—Fleet Management."" We have a well invested fleet as evidenced by the young weighted average age of our fleet which was 53 months as of June 30, 2023, compared to 54 months as of December 31, 2022, which we believe will allow more flexibility in our capital expenditures over the near to medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Data from information technology systems provides us with a comprehensive overview of the health, profitability and productivity of our fleet. Utilizing this data allows us to provide recommendations to our customers concerning which machinery might meet their requirements best. Additionally, in each depot we keep a record of each missed rental caused by an item being unavailable either in a local depot or in our fleet more broadly. We believe this allows us to better anticipate local demand and further optimize our logistics system. We invest in innovative technology that enables us to not only track our rental items on a continuous basis but also to process fleet maintenance and repairs efficiently and with relatively low administrative costs. We believe this allows us to promptly register any equipment part for maintenance, thereby reducing duplicate purchases, as well as reducing the frequency of asset audits, and rapidly identify lost items. In 2022, we fully integrated digital document management in our fleet management system for all rental items, including with respect to all test certificates and CE declarations. Therefore, this system now allows us to track important documentation with respect to legal or regulatory compliance and further work to enhance our quality control and assurance, while reducing costs and equipment downtime through regular maintenance checks and repair.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

For example, we have collaborated with our OEMs on various product improvements for our rental equipment, including the standardization of lighting units, type and positioning of support wheels and the placement of protective brackets, suspension points and lift points to aid in loading. This procurement strategy has also provided us with the ability to negotiate prices, better analyze constraints in supply and explore ground-breaking technological developments.

The digitalization of our system has facilitated our fleet maintenance and repair strategy. For each numbered item in our fleet, we keep track of the total cost of ownership, which allows us to determine which brands or items are most efficient from a cost/quality perspective. Additionally, we believe this data enables us to determine the optimal time to sell to avoid increased maintenance costs for ourselves while still offering the buyer a quality tool that can last. We may also decide to sell certain equipment sooner in cases where there is insufficient rental demand for such products. We sell our used equipment through various channels, of which direct sales from our warehouse and auction sales are the most important. We generally sell our used equipment outside of our principal markets, and occasionally we may need to sell equipment as scrap. The disposal of any piece of equipment from the fleet is a technical decision made by a technical manager based on analysis, recorded metrics, and historical lifetime expectations. We have established metrics and guidelines for each category of equipment that help determine the desired replacement cycle. Most metrics are based on repair costs relative to rental income, utilization rate and age.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

For example, in 2020, shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially reduced our capital expenditures and focused on achieving the synergies from the Cramo acquisition. Through consolidating depots in certain regions and increasing the density of our network in others, we were able to increase the utilization rates of our fleet. Following the Cramo acquisition, we also relocated equipment in order to generate better returns. In 2021 and 2022, we invested substantially in updating our fleet, which we believe not only increased our revenue and results, but also increased our flexibility and allowed us to react more quickly to increased market demand as end-market activity picked up.

We work to provide a one-stop-shop experience for our customers and aim to ensure that our rental range is available when needed, all while striving to minimize time and costs of delivery of equipment to customers and maximize economies of scale and fleet utilization performance. As part of our strategy, we divide our equipment into several subgroups which we believe enables us to analyze the most efficient and strategic routes for deployment, in addition to targeting the best possible use for our customers. Our fleet categories (Access, Earthmoving, Energy and Climate, Materials Handling, Site Huts and Site Prep, and Tools) are split into subcategories based on the characteristics of each item. By tracking maintenance costs and fuel consumption, among other metrics, we believe we are able to determine which piece of equipment is best suited for the job at the lowest cost and emissions. An increasing number of our fleet items are equipped with telematics, allowing us to track more data and provide our customers with up-to-date metrics on their usage on our recently launched MyBoels portal. Furthermore, we monitor fleet location, utilization and other metrics in one central system.

Alongside our OEMs, we plan and develop the equipment and machines we believe are needed in our markets and market segments in Europe, whether general or specialist. We believe our long-lasting relationships with large and recognized OEMs allow us to obtain useful information on new product innovations and assess market demand. Together with our OEMs, we analyze the time horizon for the next three years in terms of market demand whereby we address our requirements in terms of quality, safety and low maintenance costs. Our relationships with OEMs not only allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages. See ""—Competitive Strengths—Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust _fleet management and digital capabilities"" for additional information. Additionally, the sheer volume of our fleet provides_ important data to the OEMs on their equipment, which we believe gives us additional leverage in managing our relationship with our OEM suppliers. We do not consider ourselves dependent on any single supplier, with most pieces of equipment available from multiple different suppliers with whom we have a relationship.

With this extensive network, we are able to be closer to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return or project delivery. We believe that from an operational standpoint, this model reduces transport time and emissions, which from a service perspective results in shorter delivery and quicker response times for our customers. Our network of depots has grown significantly over the course of the past decade through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our network management is dynamic and the decision to open a branch is driven by our analysis of the interaction of the proposed branch and our existing network, the conditions in the local market and the competition within that market. Whether we open a new branch or acquire an existing network depends on the level of saturation in that market and whether acquisitions can provide us a level of penetration that would take too long to develop organically. Branches may be merged or closed based on the market environment (if, for example, a large construction ----- project concludes or an industrial site closes) or excess proximity to another branch following an acquisition. We may also relocate branches in light of the development of cities or the evolution of infrastructure, or to optimize our geographical coverage. We implement periodic network optimization plans to enhance the profitability of our depot network through better coordination of commercial activities and capital expenditures, pooling of resources, integrating overhead and backoffice activities between regions, improved exchanges of staff and equipment among branches and enhanced depot and hub positioning.

In addition, health, safety, well-being, diversity and social and ethical issues are among our top priorities. Our sustainability policy is comprised of three major ambitions: - we aim to become the most climate- and resource-efficient rental solutions company; ----- - we aspire to lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental industry; and - we strive to lead our company with high business ethics. We believe that our value chain perspective on sustainability helps us identify how we can optimally manage our impact on the environment while optimizing our business. We also strive to meet our customers' increasing needs and demands for more sustainable solutions. To help achieve our sustainability goals, we have implemented internal processes, including the establishment of a sustainability steering committee (the ""Sustainability Steering Committee""). As part of these processes, we engage with and work towards material topics, focus areas, strategic targets and targets per focus area, all of which are approved and monitored by our Sustainability Steering Committee. Based on a formal GRI 2021 materiality assessment conducted in 2022, we have identified four focus areas: customer care, employee care, environmental care and social care, each of which we describe below. Our strategic targets for each of these focus areas for 2025, in each case using 2021 as a baseline, involve: - achieving 85% of units powered by electricity within our energy powered fleet; - developing a harmonized group-wide customer satisfaction methodology; - reaching a 10% reduction of lost time injury rate, representing the average number of injuries occurring over one million working hours, (""LTIR"") per year; - attaining an employee satisfaction index of 84%; - reaching a wellbeing and diversity score of 80%; - achieving a 20% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions (measured as tCO2/sales) (for the year ended December 31, 2022, this amounted to 27.1 tCO2/sales, a decrease of 11% compared to 2021); - achieving a 15% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 energy use (measured as MWh/sales) (for the year ended December 31, 2022, this amounted to €123 million per MWh, a decrease of 12% compared to 2021); - increasing our share of renewable electricity use to above 92% (for the year ended December 31, 2022, this amounted to 56%); - having over 75% of our group entities receiving a silver or higher rating from Ecovadis (relative to revenue); and - reducing our exposure to legal proceedings pertaining to human rights, discrimination and sexual harassment, environment and anti-corruption.

Customer Care_ We believe that priority should always be given to our customers' sustainable operations. We strive to provide a safe working environment at construction sites, digitalized solutions and high-quality rental equipment and services. We also aim to help our customers minimize their climate impact by increasing circularity and offering an increased range of resource-efficient and fossil fuel-free alternatives. Our focus in this respect therefore includes investing in modern, durable and innovative technologies, in line with our aim to limit hazardous substances in our products and operations. Because of our goals, we expect our suppliers and business partners to demonstrate similarly high ethical standards as ours. We offer our customers a line of Eco-Label products, which currently consists of ecological alternatives to commonly available fuel-powered machines. These sustainable options include either electric or battery driven products, or products that have the capacity to significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions. We offer our Eco-Label products to assist customers in lowering their environmental footprint at construction sites and events. Eco-Label products also produce less noise and vibration and meet high standards for safety and user-friendliness. ----- In addition to expanding our sustainable service offering, Boels Training and Cramo Schools offer safety trainings every year to our customers. Customers' safety is a top priority, and training programs help us prevent accidents at construction sites by increasing safety awareness and competence. _Employee Care_ We strive to offer safe and healthy workplaces for our employees. Our ultimate goal is to significantly reduce, and if possible, eliminate, the occurrence of accidents within our control across our operations. We are also committed to treating our employees in an open, honest and equal way and strive to provide a diverse and inclusive culture, where all employees of different ages, gender and backgrounds have the same opportunities for development. In 2023, we have created the diversity, equity and inclusion (""DEI"") team to oversee our DEI initiatives, such as our leadership and talent programs. We believe our workforce should reflect the diversities of the communities in which we operate, and as such we strive to operate an unbiased recruiting process, remain committed to principles of fair pay and aim to consistently provide promotional opportunities. In addition, we value competence-based training and support career growth that encourages employees to achieve their full potential. We maintain confidential reporting channels for our employees throughout our organization and are in the process of harmonizing procedures following the Cramo acquisition, including through our group-wide business code of conduct which is now in place. In our Nordic regions where Cramo operates, we have a whistleblowing channel whereby any concern or issue regarding a potential compliance violation may be reported and investigated in a confidential manner. In Central Europe, we operate our ""Trust Persons"" program whereby employees can report misconduct and receive guidance, support and advice. A whistleblowing channel for Central Europe is expected launch in the near future. Finally, the safety of our employees is of critical importance to us, and we invest heavily in safety trainings and policies. Safety is a recurring topic in management sessions and is monitored through audits, inspections and reviews. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a LTIR of 16.2 and 17.4 injuries per one million working hours, respectively. _Environmental Care_ We continuously work to advance our capacities to mitigate our climate impact. In this respect, we focus on finding ways to reduce our energy consumption, increase the use of renewable energy, and increase circularity of our products across our operations. We also strive to use efficient logistics and transportation, reduce, reuse or recycle materials, reduce waste, and handle hazardous waste properly. In terms of facilities, installations and vehicle fleet, we seek to invest in energy-efficient products, services, and design for energy performance improvement. _Social Care_ We strive to respect human rights throughout our entire value chain, and we support the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which we aim to incorporate throughout our business and processes. Furthermore, we believe that an active collaboration with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders is key to the further development of sustainable rental solutions.

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer, with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing in the register on such date, which notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent, or such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act or any other applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on such date; (e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. (3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. (4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under ""Optional Redemption"" or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such tender offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such Note would remain outstanding following such purchase. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control. The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. ----- For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could lead to a mandatory prepayment and cancellation of all amounts and facilities under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. The Issuer's future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain Debt, including the Existing Senior Facilities and require a mandatory prepayment of such Debt under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and any such future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors of such repurchase. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those described under ""—Limitation on Debt."" The existence, however, of a Holder of the Notes' right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of Control. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes the rights described under ""—Events _of Default."" An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, may result in a cross-default under certain of the_ financing arrangements described under ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,"" including under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. The definition of ""Change of Control"" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ""all or substantially all"" of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors' rights and ----- compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. In the event that any one of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer or Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.1,European Union,1339.1.2,,"The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member states of the European Union (each, a ""Member State""). Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017) (as amended, the ""Recast Insolvency Regulation""), applicable within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company's ""centre of main interests"" (""COMI"") is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company's COMI ""shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties"" and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company's central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company's actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor's creditors are established. This means that a company's COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as of the date the company enters an insolvency proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor's COMI is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of ----- that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). They may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties' right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers' rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an ""establishment"" in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings must be ""secondary."" Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. An ""establishment"" is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean ""any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets."" Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where: either (i) main insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor's COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by that Member State's law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. In addition, the concept of ""group coordination proceedings"" has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under ----- Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner's recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer or the Guarantors. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (""exit day"") and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly into U.K. domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of U.K. domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146), as amended, effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the United Kingdom, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the ""Insolvency Act""), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the ""Insolvency Rules"") and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the ""U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations""). On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, and applies permanently from May 1, 2021. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of U.K. insolvency procedures across the EU and _vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for U.K. insolvency office holders and U.K. restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of a U.K. office holder has been made in reliance on a U.K. domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats (statutaire zetels) in the Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their COMI in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. The following is an outline of certain aspects of Dutch law and practice relating to insolvency laws. This is not a complete summary of currently applicable Dutch law or practice, and should not be treated as a substitute for professional advice.

In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.2,The Netherlands,1339.2.3,Suspension of Payments,"An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (i.e. more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors' meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors' meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors declare against it. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. ----- The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a ""cooling down period"" (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors' meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor's assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or canceled by operation of law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, vote in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors, unless otherwise approved by the court. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor's assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.2,The Netherlands,1339.2.5,Bankruptcy,"Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be ----- due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself; provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor's creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note's potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured pre-bankruptcy claims have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted _pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in_ a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors' meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors' meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a ""cooling down period"" for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below ""— _Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.""_ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor's assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured ----- and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors' meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ""parallel debt"" obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the ""Parallel Debt"") mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The articles of association (statuten) of the Issuer and each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantees and security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling). As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the issuance of a Note, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) (the ""Enterprise Chamber"") on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company's articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares ----- in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company's articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered. The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor's assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities' priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities' priority, most notably the lease of the debtor's premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company's articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person's bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest ----- may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor's other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders' register. However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The law relating to insolvency is regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) (the ""IO"") which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The IO regulates on the one hand bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtor's assets or company as a whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also provides for recovery proceedings - insolvency enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions. Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates the reorganization of companies in financial distress – see further below for details. As to Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Austria (the ""Austrian Guarantors""), a rebuttable presumption exists that these entities also have their respective COMI in Austria. Insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria in the event of an insolvency of a company having its COMI in Austria, or if such company has an ""establishment"" in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the Recast Insolvency Regulation does not apply, also if such company has assets in Austria. Such proceedings will be governed by Austrian law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Austria in accordance with Austrian law with respect to the assets of companies that are not organized under Austrian law. Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that the insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. A debtor is insolvent in case of illiquidity within the meaning of section 66 IO (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due) or over-indebtedness within the meaning of section 67 IO (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor's liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as a going concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)). Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a creditor's request, such creditor will have to show that the debtor is illiquid or over-indebted. In the event that the debtor is at imminent risk of becoming illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), insolvency proceedings may be initiated only upon the debtor's request. ----- The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon insolvency. If it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency immediately. If the debtor undertakes promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency, the debtor has a maximum period of 60 days to file. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IO has been amended to allow the debtor 120 days to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor's illiquidity is caused by a natural disaster, which includes pandemics, epidemics, floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or similar disasters of comparable magnitude. Depending on whether the debtor submits a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated proceedings may be in the form of recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren) or bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren). If it is the debtor that has applied for the initiation of insolvency proceedings as recovery proceedings and has submitted to the court a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that offers a recovery rate of at least 20% payable to the unsecured creditors within a maximum period of two years, the court initiates insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings. If the conditions for recovery proceedings are not met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. The legal provisions regulating recovery proceedings do not apply to bankruptcy proceedings. A debtor may also submit a recovery plan during bankruptcy proceedings that are already in progress. For the debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court it should meet certain criteria specified by sections 140 et seq IO. The purpose of a recovery plan is to enable a debtor to be released from a portion of its debts (not to exceed 80% of the aggregate amount thereof) and to continue its business operations. A recovery plan must be approved by a ""qualified majority"" of the debtor's unsecured creditors for it to become effective. For the approval of the recovery plan, two majorities must be reached: (i) more than half of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote must approve of the recovery plan and (ii) the creditors voting in favor of the recovery plan must represent more than 50% of the aggregate amount of all claims of the unsecured creditors present at such hearing. Once the debtor has complied with the terms of a recovery plan that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, it will be released from its remaining outstanding unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in accordance with the plan's terms may enforce their individual claims against the debtor. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the creditors, insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings. If the recovery proceedings have been initiated and the debtor has submitted a recovery plan that offers a recovery rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors over a maximum two-year period after the approval of such recovery plan, the debtor qualifies for self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren mit Eigenverwaltung). Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor is not allowed as of the date of the opening of the insolvency proceedings to dispose of the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). The opening of insolvency proceedings takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such proceedings in [the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the opening of insolvency proceedings](http://www.edikte.justiz.gv.at/) (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of the insolvency estate. With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either ex officio or upon the request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors' committee (Gläubigerausschuss) charged with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency estate. Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator's role is to continue the debtor's business with a view to enabling a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by implementing the debtor's recovery plan or by a (partial) sale of the debtor's business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor's business is possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor's business operations. As a result of the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized thereby will be distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such proceeds. If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either subject to the recovery administrator's approval or may be performed only by the recovery administrator. Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and must file their claim with the competent court within the period set out in the court order opening the insolvency proceedings. At the respective hearing (examination hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung)), the insolvency administrator must declare whether it acknowledges or contests each of the claims filed with the court. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor's claim, such creditor will be entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings ----- and the pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors that will follow. If a creditor's claim is contested by the insolvency administrator, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil proceedings and only then participate in the insolvency proceedings. Claims of unsecured creditors which were created before the opening of the insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzforderungen) rank pari passu among themselves. Certain claims which lawfully arose against the insolvency estate after the opening of the insolvency proceedings (privileged claims (Masseforderungen)) enjoy priority in insolvency proceedings. Claims which are secured by in rem security, such as pledge over shares (preferential claims (Absonderungsrechte)), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the realization of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution to the unsecured creditors to the extent that the proceeds from the realization of the assets charged to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval of the recovery plan to the extent their claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes, social security contributions and employee compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian law. The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during such proceedings constitute privileged claims (Masseforderungen) and rank prior to all other unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen). Claims of creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a retention of title or trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. According to the IO, a request for preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation of the debtor's business cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, unless, inter alia, the preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Once insolvency proceedings have been opened it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject to an automatic stay (Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings are terminated due to lack of funds to cover the cost of such proceedings. Execution liens obtained within the last twelve months may be subject to voidance law. According to the IO (and subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions), for a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may terminate contracts only for good cause. In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely performance by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered a good cause allowing a termination. This restriction only applies if a termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the debtor's business. No restrictions apply if a termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Furthermore, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency proceedings against the other party is not enforceable (again, subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions). Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is therefore not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor's enterprise. A reorganization procedure may be opened if a substantial and sustainable deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may be certifiably anticipated. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is not insolvent at the time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. The relevant criteria for the opening of a business reorganization procedure are a quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years applies, each as defined in, and determined in accordance with, the URG. Pursuant to section 19 of the URG, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement, for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is (subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions) not enforceable. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The likelihood of insolvency is presumed where the criteria for the opening of a business reorganization procedure under the URG (see above) are met. Creditors cannot file for the opening of restructuring proceedings. The primary objective of the ReO is the approval of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) by the majority of the creditors of the debtor in each class (see below). Such restructuring plan which shall ensure the solvency of the debtor needs to be submitted by the debtor. Under certain circumstances, the court may confirm the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), even if the qualified majority is not reached in each class (cross-class cram-down). This cramdown possibility is aimed at finally removing the disruptive potential of hold-out creditors outside of insolvency proceedings. Amongst others, the exercise of rights as well as their enforcement, may be limited under the ReO. For example, and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) claims may be restructured (for example by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a reduction in the value of the relevant claims (Forderungskürzung)), subject to certain preconditions to be met, even without the consent of or against the affected creditors, (ii) the ReO allows for a stay of individual enforcement actions (Vollstreckungssperre) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) for a period of three up to a maximum of six months and (iii) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) it is not allowed, subject to certain prerequisites to be met and exemptions (e.g. for derivatives and other financial transactions), to withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or, in any other way, modify essential contracts yet to be performed (wesentliche noch zu erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant debtor by virtue of a contractual clause providing for such measures, solely by reason of, for instance, the opening of restructuring proceedings or meeting the pre-requisites for the opening of restructuring proceedings. The ReO provides for five different possible creditor classes in restructuring proceedings: (i) secured creditors, (ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders, (iv) particularly vulnerable creditors (with claims below Euro 10,000) and (v) subordinated creditors. Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures. However, shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), with the consequence that there is no possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cram-down. Therefore, a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders. New or interim financing as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those necessary for the continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible subsequent insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing party did not know about the debtor's illiquidity. The ReO also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure that can be used by the debtor if only financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures. In such simplified proceedings, the debtor remains entirely in possession (no restructuring expert will be appointed). Further, creditors do not need to vote on a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) in a court hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring agreement that has already been signed by at least a 75% majority in value of each financial creditor class (no majority based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such restructuring agreement can be sanctioned by the court without the initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an enforcement stay in these fasttrack proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible in such proceedings. Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the ReO, which do not qualify as European restructuring proceedings (Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly available registers or data bases.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

It in particular stipulates that a loan granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder in a financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is illiquid, over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure are met) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity replacing shareholder loans must not be repaid as long as the crisis subsists and any security interest granted in connection with such loans must not be enforced. This means, in particular, that in an insolvency of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated (i.e., there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) or a right for separate satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A shareholder is defined to be, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in the borrower but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden _Einfluss) regarding the borrower. Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as_ shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which allows a dominant influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) regarding the borrowing company (indirect controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the borrowing company of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the borrowing company. Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even stricter rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to the provisions of the Act on Equity Replacements, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme Court are still applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts. In this context, it must also be noted that it is uncertain whether the rules on equity substituting shareholder loans also apply to ""a-typical pledgees"" (atypische Pfandgläubiger) and/or under what circumstances a secured lender may qualify as a-typical pledgee.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantors for the benefit of their respective creditors. The entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by Austrian capital maintenance rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships of which the general partner/s is or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders in circumstances other than as a distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by a reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability partner of which is a corporation) in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian subsidiary were not for the Austrian subsidiary's corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt). Austrian corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the group (but not for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient. Any transaction that violate Austrian capital maintenance rules are null and void. This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules. Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee with respect to liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating Austrian capital maintenance rules and the resultant invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called ""limitation language"" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Austria (see _Capital _Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language). Pursuant to such limitation language, the grant of collateral and the provision_ of upstream and sidestream guarantees of Austrian subsidiaries are limited to the extent required to avoid a breach of the Austrian capital maintenance rules. ----- No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the Indenture entered into by Austrian Guarantors, in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount permitted under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the Guarantees to the extent possible or whether the Guarantees could be deemed void in their entirety. Moreover, Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot be ruled out that future court rulings may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of subsidiaries incorporated in Austria and constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited partnership the general partner or general partners of which is or are corporations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

""Maximum Amount"" means the maximum amount which the respective Austrian Guarantor is permitted to pay or secure pursuant to the Finance Documents (i) without violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and (ii) without exposing the managing directors or members of the supervisory board of the Austrian Guarantor to any personal liability or criminal responsibility. ""Austrian Guarantor"" means a Guarantor that: (a) is incorporated and registered with the Austrian companies register (Firmenbuch); or (b) in respect of a company incorporated and registered in a non-EU member state, has its real seat of its administration in the Republic of Austria; or (c) any other corporation to which Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules apply. (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations (Verpflichtungen) and liabilities (Haftungen) of an Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement shall at all times be limited so that at no time shall an Austrian Guarantor be required to assume any liability (Haftung) or obligation (Verpflichtung) to pay or secure any amount under this Agreement to the extent that such liability (Haftung) or obligation (Verpflichtung) would violate Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. Should any obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of the Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement violate or contradict Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and therefore be held invalid or unenforceable or should the assumption or enforcement of such obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) expose any managing director, member of the supervisory board or officer of the respective Austrian Guarantor to personal (civil) liability or criminal responsibility, such obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) shall be deemed to be replaced by an obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of a similar nature (i) which is in compliance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules; (ii) which does not expose the managing directors, members of the supervisory board, or officer of the Austrian Guarantor to any personal liability or criminal responsibility; and (iii) which provides the best possible security interest in favour of the noteholders. By way of example, should it be held that any obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of the Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement contradicts Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules this obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) shall be reduced to the Maximum Amount. Such limitation may have the effect of reducing the amount of the obligations (Verpflichtungen) and liabilities (Haftungen) to zero.

A grant of security or payment under such circumstances is not voidable if the preferential treatment was given more than one year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. - Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der _Zahlungsunfähigkeit): Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the insolvent entity's_ illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or after the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings may be challenged if: - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with such connected person which is considered to be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors (nachteilige Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with respect to such payment or granting of security, or to a transaction directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor should have had knowledge of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the insolvency estate was not objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction; - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a third party which is directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; and - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) such transaction's negative effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in particular, when a recovery effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches _Sanierungskonzept)._ A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may be objectively balanced, i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, it nonetheless has a negative effect on the recovery rate of unsecured creditors.Transactions carried out more than six months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may not be voided due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der Zahlungsunfähigkeit). ----- The relevant hardening/suspect periods will commence upon the entry into of the relevant transaction. Consequently, upon the issuance of the Notes, the relevant hardening/suspect periods in relation to the Guarantees will commence. Furthermore, the relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization proceeding if such reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods. See ""Business _reorganisation proceedings.""_ In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the IO, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any transactions pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on which such other creditor exercises its voidance rights in court.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Stampable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments, mortgages. According to the GebG, stamp duty on, e.g., (a) sureties (Bürgschaft) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts to 1% of the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated as a surety for stamp duty purposes); and (b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in a case of an assignment for security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned receivables. Stampable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (section 20(5) of the GebG). Note that this exemption is not available for, inter alia, security for the Notes. As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampable transaction is created in Austria and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty. Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampable transaction outside of Austria may trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria. If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria. Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampable transaction in a qualified manner (so called confirming document; _rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered by a so-called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a stampable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampable transaction. If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the GebG generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance (e.g. a surety), the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the GebG). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of the stampable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within their discretion. ----- If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a stampable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the GebG have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017) (recast) (the ""Recast Insolvency Regulation"") and Belgian law also allow territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets (located in Belgium) of companies that do not have their center of main interests in Belgium. The effects of those territorial bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide mainly for two in court insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy _(faillissement/faillite). Both proceedings are regulated by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de _droit économique), as amended. Note that Belgian insolvency law offers different out of court restructuring options but_ that these will not be further discussed. Recently an Act was adopted in the Belgian Parliament to implement the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 (the ""New Insolvency Act""). The New Insolvency Act amends certain provisions of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law, in particular with respect of restructuring proceedings. These new provisions apply to insolvency proceedings (including judicial restructuring) opened as of September 1, 2023. Note that the New Insolvency Act distinguishes between private and public (in court) reorganization proceedings and offers the possibility for companies to silently prepare for bankruptcy proceedings (the ""Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceeding""). These key changes are briefly discussed below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.4,Belgium,1339.4.2,Judicial Reorganization,"Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to all legal entities as well as all individuals that qualify as an enterprise (onderneming/entreprise) in the sense of Article I.1, 1° of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, subject to certain exceptions for regulated liberal professions, credit institutions and certain other entities active on the financial and insurance markets. A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. The contents of this principle are broad and are defined in practice by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the legal obligation to declare bankruptcy under Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for judicial reorganization. The obligation to declare bankruptcy is suspended as from the filing of a petition for judicial reorganization. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company's registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. The petition for judicial reorganization must indicate the measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to carry out the reorganization. A number of documents must also be attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, an interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor, an external expert accountant or a certified tax accountant. The court may however review and, as the case may be, grant a petition to open judicial reorganization proceedings where the debtor has been unable to provide certain required documents. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court's decision, subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor's assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. If the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months before and such request was granted, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect, except if the court decides otherwise. ----- Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for reorganization and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After this hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and all required documents have been provided, the court will declare the judicial reorganization proceeding open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months (for proceedings opened before September 1, 2023) or four months (for proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023). At the request of the debtor or the relevant insolvency practitioners and after having obtained a report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the initial start of the moratorium period. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization proceeding in the last twelve months before the new request. The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor's assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. Furthermore, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to create legal or contractual security. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor, these will not be affected by the moratorium provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor's customers) during the moratorium. Receivables that form part of a pledge over business assets do not benefit from such exemption. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the ""Belgian Financial Collateral Act""), such as shares in any Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on cash held on accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor's creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor in principle continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the reorganization, the court may appoint an enterprise mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d'entreprise) to assist the debtor during the moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of all or part of its assets or its activities. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon the request of the debtor, any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings (kennelijk grove tekortkomingen/manquements graves _et caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties_ or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et caractérisée), the court may, upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopig _bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor's corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium and_ charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management of all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, _bepaalde_ _en_ _met_ _elkaar_ _overeenstemmende _aanwijzigingen/indices graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._ Note that the New Insolvency Act aims at simplifying the existing regime and introducing new insolvency practitioners, ie the restructuring expert (herstructureringsdeskundige/practicien de la reorganization) and the liquidation expert (vereffeningsdeskundige/practicien de la liquidation) – both considered judicial administrators. The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the reorganization, has additional powers, including the power to advise the court to end the reorganization procedure prematurely if he or she considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of his or her business. ----- Reorganization proceedings aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the proceeding does not terminate any contracts. Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Subject to certain conditions, such enforcement prohibition does not apply to close-out netting provisions. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor's default that occurred prior to the reorganization proceeding if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable agreement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

For that purpose, within a period of 8 days following the ruling declaring the judicial restructuring proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the restructuring procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the restructuring plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a restructuring plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures, such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations, and the swap of debt into equity, and may be based on a differentiated treatment for certain various categories of liabilities. The plan must be filed with the Clerk's Office of the enterprise court at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan. The plan will be approved if a double majority (both in headcount and in principal amount due) of the creditors vote in favor, it being understood that the court needs to ratify the restructuring plan prior to it taking effect. The plan will be binding on the debtor and on all creditors (including the ones who voted against the plan, or abstained). For judicial restructuring proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023, a new voting system will apply for restructuring plans which involve large enterprises debtors (ie if during two consecutive financial years, one or more of the following thresholds have been met: (i) annual average number of employees of 250, (ii) annual turnover excluding VAT of €40,000,000, or (iii) the balance sheet total reaches €20,000,000 – this also applies if group companies together exceed one or more of the thresholds). Under the large enterprise regime, creditors (including shareholders) can and to a certain extend must be placed in different voting classes if their rights in a hypothetical liquidation or the rights obtained under the ----- restructuring plan are so dissimilar that there is no comparable position (in most cases, there will be a class of privileged creditors and of non-privileged creditors). In principle, a restructuring plan is adopted if every class has voted in favor of the restructuring plan, i.e. if a simple majority (in amount of the claim or interest) is obtained. If one or more classes vote against the plan, the court can only sanction the reorganization plan via a 'cross-class cram down' mechanism. This requires that additional confirmation criteria are met. SME's may opt-in to this new regime or choose to apply the SME voting regime, which resembles the current voting regime for collective agreement (see above). These two regimes are therefore coexisting in Book XX of the Code of Economic Law, the legislators' objective being not to hinder access to reorganisation procedures for small businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor's enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The price of the transferred assets should at least be equal to the liquidation value/assets to be transferred. In the case of comparable offers, priority will be given to the offer guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement.

Following the transfer, claims of creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to certain exceptions.

Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors' claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in respect of any ""enterprise"" as defined by Article I.1, 1° of the Code of Economic Law (which includes notably any legal person, other than certain public law entities). Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt _is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts_ as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor's assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The mere fact that an enterprise has more debts than assets does not entail the bankruptcy conditions are met with. Companies whose judicial liquidation has been started can be declared bankrupt up to six months after the judgments of the closing of the liquidation. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order) or whether they terminate ongoing contracts unilateral if such termination is required for administrating the bankrupt estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may summon the receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, for which claim he has to file a debt claim in the bankruptcy. The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. Further, the opening of bankruptcy proceedings will not cause ongoing agreements to terminate. The following exceptions however apply: a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and b) _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge of financial instruments or cash held on account, falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period until the filing of the first report of claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU member state, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security. ----- The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of such rules: a) _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called ""estate debts,"" have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. b) _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). c) _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. d) _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors (and secured/privileged creditors if the security/privilege did not allow them to be paid in full) who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). e) Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member's corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the management of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company's management will be subject to only a ""marginal review"" by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors or managers of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as ""abuse of company goods"" (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ""limitation language"" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. The limitation language applicable to any Belgian Guarantor which will be included in the Indenture will substantially be in the following form: a) ""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the guarantee, indemnity and other obligations of any Belgian Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to a maximum amount equal to the greater of: (i) an amount equal to 85% of that Belgian Guarantor's net assets, as calculated on the basis of its most ----- recent audited annual financial statements at the time the relevant demand is made and (ii) the outstanding amount of any intra-group loans, advances or facilities made to that Belgian Guarantor by any other member of the Group directly and/or indirectly using all or part of the proceeds of the Notes (whether or not such intra-group loan is retained by the relevant Belgian Guarantor for its own purposes or on-lent) at the time the relevant demand is made, and in any case the total liability of any Belgian Guarantor shall at all times be limited to the extent it would constitute unlawful financial assistance in accordance with article 5:152, article 6:118 or article 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. b) Any payment made by the Belgian Guarantor under this Section and any proceeds received by the Trustee and/or the Security Agent in connection with any Transaction Security granted by such Belgian Guarantor shall reduce the guaranteed amount determined in accordance with the formula in paragraph a) above. c) For the purposes of this Section, the net assets of a Belgian Guarantor means its ""netto actief""/""actif net,"" as defined in Articles 320 and/or 617 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, as amended or superseded.""",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the ""hardening period"" (verdachte periode/période suspecte). The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others: (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the act or asset provided by the debtor; (ii) payments for debts that are not yet due; (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due; and (iv) new security provided for preexisting debts. Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor's cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the guarantee or security interests provided, (ii) the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the company's cessation of payments or (iii) it is granted for preexisting debts. ----- If the Guarantee or security interests granted by a Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests. Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Enterprise Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor may obtain a court ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana), irrespective of its date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ""unable to pay its debts"" (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a ""qualifying floating charge"" (discussed below)) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator via an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company's property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer or the Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property that is either not subject to security, or is subject to a floating charge - however an administrator may only dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the leave of the court or with the consent of the secured creditor). The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. A secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator's powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (UK) (the ""Financial Collateral Regulations""). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) over financial collateral (including cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be extended by court order or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors). The Issuer or the Guarantors may exit administration if the administrator is satisfied that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon application to and subsequent order of the court if the administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume ----- normal business upon exiting administration. However, the administrator also has the power, should he or she conclude that there is no reasonable prospect of rescuing the company, to either place the company into liquidation or use the powers granted to administrators under, and in accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company's assets and thereby achieve substantially the same result as a liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The latter are not administrative receivers and are mostly used to sell land or other specific assets subject to a fixed charge. The contexts within which each would be appointed are described below. If a company registered in England and Wales grants a ""qualifying floating charge"" to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver provided the qualifying floating charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ""capital market arrangements"" (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ""capital market investment"" (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically provided for in English law-governed security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925 for the holder of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to appoint a receiver over the charged assets to collect the income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction of the secured debt. A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the relevant security documentation which typically provide for the ability of secured creditors to appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in accordance with their terms. Once appointed, the receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The security document pursuant to which the receiver is appointed will typically set out the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these powers will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged assets, with the proceeds being used to pay the secured creditors. An administrative receiver's and, typically, a receiver's primary duty is to realize secured assets and pay the proceeds to the relevant secured creditors, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the Prescribed Part (discussed below)). Both an administrator receiver and a receiver, however, also owe a duty to the company, in particular to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable at the relevant time when selling any asset. There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and terminating contracts. If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the appointment of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the administrator consents or the court permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. In contrast the appointment of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the appointment of an administrator. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed over part of the company's property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed ----- under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company's members, which is in turn divided into members' voluntary liquidation (""MVL"") (which can only be proposed by a solvent company) and creditors' voluntary liquidation (""CVL""). A CVL (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. A creditor, the company or in certain circumstances a shareholder, among others, can present a winding-up petition to the court for the compulsory winding-up of a company. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above) or that the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company via compulsory liquidation if it is a company registered in England and Wales or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an ""establishment"" in England and Wales or (iii) in the case of an unregistered foreign company, if it has enough of a ""sufficient connection"" with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except Denmark) but which has an ""establishment"" in England and Wales) may enter a creditors' voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company's property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a ""financial collateral arrangement"" under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company's affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding twelve months from the start of the liquidation. A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors' choice will prevail. On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors' powers to bind the company automatically cease, save for those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company's property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favor of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor's consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor's consent will be needed to release the security), and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. ----- Under English insolvency law, with some exceptions, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors. A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a member state of the EEA or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a member state of the EEA but has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) or in the United Kingdom. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company's directors (if the relevant company is not in administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the administrator or the liquidator (as applicable). The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company's unsecured debts, but may also form part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different creditor groups. A CVA requires the approval of a majority of 75% or more in value of the creditors of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, a resolution approving a CVA will be invalid if those creditors voting against it include more than 50% in value of all the creditors who are unconnected with the relevant company. A CVA will bind all unsecured creditors of a company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure, subject to the right that creditors have to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a CVA in certain circumstances. Additionally, a CVA will not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors without their consent. A CVA also requires the approval of more than 50% in value of the company's members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome of the meeting of members differs from the outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail. Like creditors, members also have the right to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company's property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; ----- - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate, e.g. any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver, moratorium debts, (in certain circumstances) certain ""priority pre-moratorium debts"" and expenses of the liquidation or administration (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (""FSCS"") up to the statutory limit. - Secondary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii) VAT, PAYE, income tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions and other certain tax debts (excluding corporation tax and employers' NI contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers) due to HM Revenue and Customs (""HMRC""), as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. - This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration, which preceded such liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act). An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge ----- realizations) (the ""Prescribed Part""). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the company's net property and 20% of the remainder of the company's net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company's net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including an administrative receiver) to set aside a Prescribed Part of the company's property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Regulations).",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period following the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given, or certain transactions entered into, by such company, and, as such, it cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of the English Obligor's insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold a transaction as valid.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings. _Transactions at an undervalue_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money's worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. ----- If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction (which may include the setting aside of any security interests or guarantees granted). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person (as defined in ""England and Wales—Connected Persons"" below), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction and did not become unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company's creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company's debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. The desire to prefer requires a positive wish to improve the creditor's position in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation. A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced only by proper commercial considerations there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which could include reducing payments under or setting aside the relevant Notes, Guarantees and Collateral (although there is certain protection for a third party who enters into a transaction in good faith and without notice). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the Connected Person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company. _Invalid floating charges_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a Connected Person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months before the onset of insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists ----- of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge, the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company, and the amount of the interest on any such amounts in pursuance of any agreement under which the money was so paid, the goods or services were so supplied or the debt was so discharged or reduced. No court action is required. Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to appoint an administrator out of court or through the less onerous in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests. It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a ""victim"" of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transactions_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside as an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). That order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in an extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). ----- _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e., not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

A ""Connected Person"" of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual, or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner. A person is an associate of any person with whom they are in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil partner or relative of any individual with whom they are in partnership. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case, directors of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom they employ. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are their associates together have control of it. A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or (ii) it is controlled by a person and that person's associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is controlled by a group of two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom they are an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with their directions or instructions, or they are entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor's ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a ----- purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property which is ring fenced (see explanation of the Prescribed Part above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge holder. It may also prevent the holder relying on that charge to appoint a receiver.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the aforementioned do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the English court has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with ""likely"" in this context meaning ""probable."" Security and/or Guarantees granted by the English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to U.K. company law. Under U.K. company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the property to the chargee but retains legal title to the property. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control. ----- In addition, the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (the ""NSIA"") came into force in January 2022 as the United Kingdom's new national security screening regime.

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of ""financial instruments"" includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds. The definition of “credit claims” includes claims under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the United Kingdom. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency officeholder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration proceedings and furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interests applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank's rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank's netting and set-off rights.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company's COMI is in England, the company's finance documents are English law governed, or the company's finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in any given case. English courts are unlikely to sanction a scheme for a foreign company where to do so would be in vain and they will want to ensure that a proposed scheme will be recognized in jurisdictions outside of England and Wales, as relevant. The English court has previously sanctioned schemes where expert evidence was provided showing that it is more likely than not that the scheme would be recognized in each jurisdiction where the company has material assets or liabilities. However, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not this test would be satisfied in any given case. ----- Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Classes must be comprised of those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in voting and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. If sanctioned by the court, a scheme will be binding on each relevant class of creditors (both secured and unsecured) and members including any dissenting or abstaining party. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the Recast Insolvency Regulation on the basis that they are not considered to be 'insolvency' proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the ""Brussels Regulation"") was commonly relied upon as a basis on which recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning the scheme could be obtained in each Member State. The Brussels Regulation ceased to apply to the United Kingdom on December 31, 2020, meaning that an alternative avenue of recognition for schemes is now required. Such avenues include recognition on the basis of the private international law of the relevant Member States or through the following instruments which, together, provide that schemes should still be recognized in Member States notwithstanding that the United Kingdom no longer benefits from the Brussels Regulation: - Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the ""Hague Convention""): where parties have stipulated an exclusive choice of court agreement in their contracts, the Hague Convention requires that the parties' decision and choice of court be respected. It further provides that any judgment rendered by the chosen court will be recognized and enforced in other signatory states. While the Hague Convention may allow for a scheme which seeks to compromise contractual arrangements which contain an exclusive choice of court agreement in favor of the Courts of the United Kingdom to be recognized in other signatory states, it does not apply to “insolvency, composition and analogous matters”; therefore, its application to schemes is not certain. The United Kingdom ceased to be a signatory of the Hague Convention (via its membership of the EU) on December 31, 2020, but acceded as a signatory in its own right as of January 1, 2021. - Bilateral treaties: some Member States have their own laws, or bilateral treaties with the U.K., that might enable recognition of an English scheme. However the number of these Member States is limited and the application of these laws and treaties to schemes is untested. - The Rome regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations ((EC) No 593/2008) (""Rome I""): allows parties to a contract to choose the law governing contractual obligations and applies in all Member States (except Denmark). Following December 31, 2020, Rome I will continue to be applicable in respect of recognition by Member States (except Denmark) of judgments given in the Courts of the United Kingdom, allowing parties to choose the law applicable to the contracts and for the choice of law to be respected in all Member States. In the context of English law governed debt that is compromised under an English scheme, Rome I will allow the relevant scheme order to be recognized throughout the EU.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.5,England and Wales,1339.5.18,Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020,"On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (""CIGA 2020"") enacted fundamental reforms to the United Kingdom's existing insolvency and companies legislation. _Moratorium_ Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a 'debtor-in-possession' process, meaning that a company ----- in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a 'monitor'. Despite the existence of a ""payment holiday"" in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under obligations incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as ""priority pre-moratorium debts""), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts. Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. _Ipso facto clauses prohibited_ CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition. _Restructuring plan_ CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006 (see ""England and Wales—Scheme of Arrangement""), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. This new standalone restructuring plan under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a restructuring plan. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. Save as set out above, there are no additional financial eligibility criteria, thereby making restructuring plans available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the restructuring plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency office holder). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see above), any creditors in respect of ""moratorium debts"" and ""priority pre-moratorium debts"" (see ""—Moratorium"") may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan without their consent. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant meeting, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic interest in the company. The creditors/members of a class are deemed to approve a restructuring plan if at least 75% in value of the creditors/members of that class who are present and voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in favor of the proposals. Unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in number of those creditors present and voting to vote in favor of a restructuring plan for class approval to be given. ----- As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme of arrangement does not have, a ""cross-class cram down"" provision. This allows the court to sanction a restructuring plan even if not all of the relevant classes of creditors and/or members have voted in favor of it. In order for the court to sanction a cross-class cram down the court must be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the ""relevant alternative"" (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and that the plan has been agreed by 75% in value of a class of creditors or members present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court's discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable. Parties' rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see above) to provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible. As above, the Hague Convention contains exclusions whereby it is deemed not to apply to judgments handed down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands, the English Court considers that restructuring plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties in order to propose a restructuring plan. The recognition of a restructuring plan in Member States therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those Member States, and may be less straightforward than the recognition of a scheme of arrangement. _So-called ""Henry VIII"" powers_ CIGA 2020 further confers on the U.K. government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.5,England and Wales,1339.5.19,,"One of the Guarantors is a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the ""English Obligor""). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligor would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, as discussed in the section ""—European Union"" above, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and, where a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union, any main insolvency proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State. Equally, even though the Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, it is possible that it (or other Guarantors) could be subject to English insolvency proceedings. Although the factors English courts assess when determining whether they have jurisdiction vary for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts do have the ability to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings. However, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions. Similarly, the U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the ""Model Law"") in the United Kingdom, which provides legislative provisions to deal with the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions), Implementation of the Model Law has been adopted without a requirement of reciprocity. Under national law implementing the Model Law, a foreign court may recognize certain U.K. insolvency proceedings as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). Under the Model Law, an ""establishment"" is defined to mean a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where the entity carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services. Furthermore, the U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where any English company has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non-main proceedings where it has an ""establishment"" in such foreign jurisdiction. As such, should the English Obligor have its COMI in a country other than the United Kingdom, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be foreign non-main proceedings and would be limited to the assets that the English Obligor has in the United Kingdom. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply on a temporary basis to prevent certain types of creditor action in the United Kingdom, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor's assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor's rights to enforce security over the debtor's property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies in relation to foreign non-main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a ""qualifying floating charge"" (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the Issuer or a Guarantor (to the extent applicable).",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In the event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law. In case of insolvency proceedings connected to another EU member state within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation shall apply. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Finnish insolvency law. The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended), the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended, the ""Finnish Restructuring Act"") and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään, 758/1991, as amended, the ""Finnish Recovery Act"") are particularly relevant to this discussion. Under Finnish law, if a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, the company may be the subject of two alternative types of proceedings: company restructuring (yrityssaneeraus) and bankruptcy (konkurssi). Further, the company restructuring proceedings may be divided into standard restructuring proceedings (perusmuotoinen _saneerausmenettely) described below more in detail and early restructuring proceedings (varhainen saneerausmenettely)._ Liquidation proceedings (selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended) generally concern only solvent companies as there is an obligation to conclude liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the full settlement of all of the company's debts is not possible in liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.6,Finland,1339.6.2,Company Restructuring,"If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for company restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with the Finnish ----- Restructuring Act. Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible - in theory, irrespective of the company's solvency situation - when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor's known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor's application for company restructuring. If no statutory barriers to restructuring under the Finnish Restructuring Act are established and, consequently, the court approves the application and opens restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a restructuring administrator (selvittäjä). The purpose of a company restructuring is to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company's viable business, ensure its continued viability and make debt arrangements with creditors and execute other measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the company's books and business documents and obtain any information on the company's business activities, as well as to participate in meetings of the debtor's corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator's consent is required to certain legal acts of a significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act. The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor's existing contracts (though restructuring debts deriving from such contracts may obviously be reorganized). However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act regarding premature termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor, contracts pursuant to which the debtor is obliged to make performances of non-monetary nature repeatedly or continuously (e.g., supply agreement), and employment relationships. _Moratorium_ Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the company that have arisen before the filing of the restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced), and the seizure of assets. The court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such prohibitions are in effect on an interim basis as of a date even prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e., shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The suspensions are in force until the restructuring program has been approved by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted. Debts arising after the filing of the application must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees, charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a continuous contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the application. _Debt arrangements_ Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts (i.e., debts that have arisen before the filing of the application) within the restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to the creditor's position and field of business. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor's claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. The part of the claim that is not covered by the value of the security is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value of the property will be determined by the restructuring program. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; and (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt. ----- Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor's security right, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs. _Approval of the restructuring program_ The draft of the restructuring program will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will approve it subject to the acceptance of all the creditors or of the majority in each group of creditors. However, there are some specific limitations under the Finnish Restructuring Act which apply even if the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore, even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft, the administrator or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act. In such a case the restructuring claims of the creditors in favor of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all known restructuring claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring Act and at least one group of creditors must have voted for approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also submit a proposal to the court with respect to the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its discretion. _Early restructuring proceedings_ In addition to what has been described above in respect of standard restructuring proceedings, debtors facing impending insolvency also have an option under the Finnish Restructuring Act to apply for the commencement of early restructuring proceedings. Early restructuring proceedings are more easily accessible to debtors, as the commencement of such proceedings does not require that the relevant debtor would already be insolvent (e.g. impending insolvency (uhkaava maksukyvyttömyys)_ being the requirement) and creditors have more restricted rights to object to the commencement of such proceedings. The initiation of early insolvency proceedings by the creditors is not possible. The court deciding on the commencement of early insolvency proceedings may prohibit the placing of any security and payment of any existing debt as described under ""Moratorium"" above. However, in early restructuring proceedings, such restrictions have to be ordered by the court deciding on the restructuring application and such restrictions are in effect as of the date when such restrictions have been ordered. Such moratorium may remain in force for up three months which period may be extended by the court to up to twelve months based on an application from either the debtor, the administrator or a creditor. In case the debtor is later found insolvent, the administrator (if appointed) may with the consensus of the debtor and creditors representing at least one-fifth of the debtor's known debts apply for a transfer to standard restructuring proceedings. In general, the content and process of the early restructuring proceedings is by large similar to standard restructuring proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court. A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors' claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional situations) continue the company's business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as it is reasonably possible. The debtor's assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decisionmaking powers of the creditors. _Notices to the bankruptcy estate with regard to claims_ As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a ""lodgment of claim"") with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator. Information concerning the deadline is sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official gazette of Finland (Virallinen lehti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is mandatory even for a creditor with a secured ----- claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of, and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and collateral as should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (Yrityskiinnityslaki, 634/1984, as amended), as security for a claim shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim letter. _Disbursements_ The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors (""draft disbursement list""). The court verifies that the estate administrator's disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft disbursement list have been observed. The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on Order of Payment of the Creditors (Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä, 1578/1992, as amended), the following creditors have priority over unsecured creditors in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset; (ii) the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with penalty interest incurred until the time of payment of the fees and expenses and after satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; and (iv) claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy and a loan or a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds, including by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that have an interest in collateral may exercise their right of liquidation of collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (Ulosottokaari, 705/2007, as amended, the ""Finnish Enforcement Code"") if the bailiff consents to the same.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code, the grounds for recovery set forth in the Finnish Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company restructuring and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor's counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company restructuring program, the administrator must file an action within one year from the commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or ----- relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor's economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Finnish Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor's sphere of interest (as defined in the Finnish Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction. Pursuant to the Finnish Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the debtor or the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. In the case of company restructuring, the returned property is to be held separately from the debtor's other assets and, after payment of the expenses resulting from the recovery, the returned property shall be used in accordance with the restructuring program. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Finnish Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of any such Guarantee or security agree to enforce the relevant Guarantee or security against the relevant Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. Such mandatory limitations to a company's ability to grant guarantees and third-party security are included in Sections 1 and 10 of Chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, under Finnish law if a company undertakes a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that deviate to the detriment of the company from arms' length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit distribution. The Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so is in the company's own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant circumstances, benefits and risks to the company (on a standalone basis, and any group benefit being taken into account only if and to the extent it directly or indirectly benefits the company itself) are to be taken into account. In the context of the guarantee or security, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by a Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the group companies in connection with the issue of the Notes are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the guarantee and security granted by a Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application ----- of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee and security, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed and secured. For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, security agreements and guarantees to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Guarantees granted by the Finnish Guarantors and the Security Documents under which any security have been granted by the Finnish Guarantors contain such limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of such Guarantees and security agree to enforce the relevant Guarantee and security against the relevant Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time period before the commencement of insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically, collection of receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the district court in order to obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement. In the case of a bank account, the pledge would be enforced by the creditor withdrawing the funds from the account and applying such funds towards the secured obligations.The Finnish Commercial Code (Kauppakaari, 3/1734, as amended) stipulates a default process in respect of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default process. The parties' discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee. A pledge of business mortgage notes may outside bankruptcy proceedings be enforced only through the public enforcement procedure set forth in the Finnish Enforcement Code. The creditor must first seek to obtain a court judgment or an arbitral award confirming the debtor's obligation to repay the debt. The enforcement of the court judgment or arbitral award is then carried out by a bailiff. Either the bailiff decides which property covered by the business mortgage will be sold in the auction or alternatively, the creditor may directly in the court proceedings rely on the business mortgage and petition to a specified property covered by the business mortgage. In the latter case, the court would order the specific property covered by the business mortgage to be sold by the bailiff in the auction. The sale may also be conducted by other means (such as a sale organized by a private auctioneer or other sale than a public auction organized by the bailiff). It should be noted that in the enforcement procedure, the priority of the holder of a business mortgage over the unsecured debtors is up to the full net realization value of the mortgaged property, whereas in bankruptcy proceedings the priority is limited to 50 per cent. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Consequently, under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, absent any change in circumstances, their centre of main interests at the time of an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is likely to be in Germany, and insolvency proceedings are likely to be initiated in Germany, in which case German insolvency law would govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the certain German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors' claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors, security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung _der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides_ for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies as well as the concentration of proceedings at the same court. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ""coordination proceedings"" (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ""coordination insolvency administrator"" (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ""coordination plan"" (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor's business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive _Fortführungsprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to_ Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Anpassungsanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur _Abmilderung von Krisenfolgen) (the ""SanInsKG""), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced_ to four (4) months until December 31, 2023. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a company limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a German stock corporation ----- (Aktiengesellschaft) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, (i) in the case of illiquidity at the latest within 3 weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason of, illiquidity occurred and (ii) in case of over indebtedness within 6 weeks (which period is temporarily extended to eight weeks applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 until December 31, 2023 according to the SanInsKG) after the mandatory insolvency reason of over-indebtedness occurred. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Moreover, once illiquidity or over-indebtedness has occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably (predominantly likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Proceedings are generally split into two distinct phases: Preliminary insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren) and formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren). Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige _Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The_ insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court usually also appoints a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung). The debtor-in-possession proceeding is an insolvency process in which the debtor's management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor's business affairs under the supervision of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), provided that, _inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession status and no circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on inaccurate facts. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, depending on the size of the debtor's business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors' committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the preliminary insolvency administrator or the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors' committee unanimously agree on an individual, as candidate for that role, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors' committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The court may add a representative for other creditor constituencies as well. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor's assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes _Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at_ least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse) following which the company will, inter alia, be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation. Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor's business affairs and to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors' assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority of the debtor's assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial ----- indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ""ipso facto clauses"" entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des _Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to_ agreements that are not governed by German law. For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of any opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a subsidiary of the Issuer (assuming the applicability of the German insolvency regime) would be the following: - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of assets of such subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such subsidiary of the Issuer, disposals effected by the management of such subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing of a petition for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor of such subsidiary of the Issuer in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in any part of such subsidiary of the Issuer's property that forms part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against such subsidiary of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor's possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. There is, however, no authoritative case law on this question. In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9%. of the gross enforcement proceeds (but can be higher or lower) plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to ----- an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims - _Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy e.g. unsecured creditors under a Guarantee granted by any German Guarantor in full after the secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor's assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor's business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of the debtor (i.e., the legal entity in case of a company) can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., these can be transferred to third-parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to utilize up an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors' rights to enforce certain security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the preliminary custodian) may avoid (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency administrator or preliminary custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator's or preliminary custodian's right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a ""shareholder like position"" (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from note guarantees would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. ----- In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully avoided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the Notes or the Guarantees, the insolvency administrator of the payor may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and the recipient would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or the Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases: - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be avoided if the act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was cash flow insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being cash flow insolvent (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow insolvency or filing); - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be avoided if the act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was cash flow insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor; - any legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right, or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was insolvent and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being insolvent; - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt is regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be avoided unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten year period is reduced to four years; ""knowledge by the beneficiary of the act"" in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the ""knowledge by the beneficiary of the act"" is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term 'affiliated party' includes, ----- subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a claim (Befriedigung) of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security (Sicherung), if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction (Befriedigung), if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder _Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, ""knowledge"" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor's illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors. With respect to an ""affiliated party"", there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ""knowledge"". The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ""cash transaction"" and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to avoidness rights under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian avoiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings over the payor's assets. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. To the extent possible the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied after the other claims of insolvency creditors have been satisfied in full in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor's gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the relevant loan or legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den _Stabilisierungs und Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen) (""Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act""),_ which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (""Restructuring Proceedings"") are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des _Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and_ Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it ----- is predominantly likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor's management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under ""—Insolvency""). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor's liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor's liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security provided to secure debts owed by the debtor and granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under ""—Insolvency""). The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor's liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the respective debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors' creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors even if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain legal requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can, among other things, restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its centre of main interest in Germany would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the relevant Guarantor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions may apply on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by a restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the relevant Guarantor as well as related intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament ----- and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law and/or the applicable rules on the recognition of foreign judgments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Any Guarantee granted by a German Guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—""GmbH"") is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter _Haftung—""GmbHG"")._ As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (""Sections 30 and 31"") prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company or an affiliated company (verbundenes _Unternehmen) of such shareholder within the meaning of section 15 et. seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act_ (Aktiengesetz) are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or a sister company or an affiliated company (verbundenes Unternehmen) of such shareholder within the meaning of section 15 et. seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability (as well as criminal prosecutions), it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ""limitation language"" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH. Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of any subsidiary Guarantee or security given by the German subsidiary incorporated as a GmbH will be limited if and to the extent payments (or security granting or enforcement) under any such subsidiary Guarantee (or security) would cause the German subsidiary Guarantor's net assets to fall below, or increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any Guarantee or security provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described. These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the right of payment and/or enforcement and would limit the claim accordingly irrespective of the granting of the subsidiary Guarantee or security pursuant to the Indenture. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect the enforcement of the payment obligations under the German Guarantees and/or the ability of the German subsidiary Guarantors to make payments on the subsidiary Guarantees and/or security. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding Section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) - now contained in Section 15 lit. b) para 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (i.e., a situation where a managing director makes a payment to the GmbH's shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the GmbH) or a so-called — ""destructive interference"" (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its payment obligations towards its creditors) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a subsidiary Guarantee (or granting and/or enforcement of security) granted by the German subsidiary Guarantors. In such case, the amount of proceeds permitted or capable to be realized in an enforcement process may be (further) reduced (up to zero). According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary Guarantees (or granting and/or enforcement of security) by the German subsidiary Guarantors. ----- Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary Guarantee (or granting and/or enforcement of security) or a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor's (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. The enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded, according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche _Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice_ (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a Guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) of such Guarantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of such Guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor's managing directors pursuant to section 15b paras 4 and 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner (Komplementär).",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Such accessory security interests (i) cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim, (ii) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated and (iii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a ""parallel debt."" Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the ""Parallel Debt Obligation""). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the ""Principal Obligations""), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security interest granted significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive overcollateralization. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination with other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is ----- exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (e.g. share pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the German Federal High Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis, legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Further, relevant rules are laid down in non-statutory law and the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (Dekningsloven) (the ""Recovery Act""), which contains general provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims. A new debt restructuring procedure has temporarily replaced (and, subject to forthcoming legislation, may in some form permanently replace) the court-administered debt negotiations proceedings in the Bankruptcy Act – see ""—Restructuring Proceedings"" below. The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor's assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor's contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or purporting to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy. There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debts as they become due (the ""cash flow test""), and (ii) be in ""deficit"" (the company's debts must exceed the sum of its assets, based on real, not book, values) (the ""balance sheet test""). During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor's assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor's assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors pursuant to the applicable priority provisions. All of the debtor's assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets have been acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner or the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity that is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets including, but not limited to, the realization of assets. Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the secured assets is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed an ordinary (unsecured) claim. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover the secured portion of their claims; however, the enforcement of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to restructuring proceedings). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets. Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien, to cover its costs and expenses, over assets pledged by the insolvent company. The statutory lien of the bankruptcy estate is limited to 5% of the estimated value or sales proceeds of the encumbered assets, but limited to 700 times the applicable Norwegian court fee for each registered asset (such court fee being currently NOK 1,243). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (security over cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (Lov om _finansiell sikkerhetsstillelse) (the ""Financial Collateral Act""), cf. the Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 (Panteloven) (the_ ""Liens Act"") Section 6-4 (9). In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the claims are provided with the following priority: ----- (i) secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset – either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate); (ii) super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, the liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate); (iii) salary claims (within certain limitations); (iv) tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations); (v) ordinary unsecured claims (all other unsubordinated claims, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and (vi) subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims). Creditors will obtain recovery from the surplus remaining after claims with better priority have been settled. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out within certain periods (ranging from three to twelve months depending on the grounds for setting aside or reversing the transaction and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt or perfected with undue delay and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The temporary debt restructuring procedure replaces the court-administered debt negotiations proceedings mentioned above until 1 July 2025. On January 13, 2023, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security submitted a legislative proposal for amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the Recovery Act and the Liens Act. The main purpose of the proposal is to implement rules on restructuring to replace the rules on court-administered debt negotiations proceedings in the Bankruptcy Act and the temporary rules in the Restructuring Act. The proposal has been subject to a consultation period and is currently under consideration. Under the Restructuring Act, debt restructuring proceedings are available to companies that are facing serious economic difficulties in the near-term without necessarily being unable to pay their debts as they fall due. Furthermore, any of the company's creditors may request debt restructuring proceedings if the company is unable to meet its obligations as they fall due.

However, the debt restructuring period shall normally not exceed six months, and the stay does not apply to security interests over monetary claims or any financial collateral arrangement in accordance with the Financial Collateral Act. Debt restructuring proceedings may result in either a voluntary settlement or a compulsory composition, which in each case may consist of a payment extension, pro rata reduction of debt, conversion of debt to equity, liquidation of all or parts of the debtor's assets or a combination of these measures, and/or in case of voluntary settlements, certain other measures. The adoption of a voluntary settlement requires the consent of all creditors comprised by the proposed settlement, while the adoption of a compulsory composition requires the consent of only 50% of the affected creditors (measured in value, not the number of creditors), however so that a composition consisting of converting debt to equity would normally need the consent of all relevant creditors (as well as consent from at least 50% of the company's shareholders). Pursuant to the Restructuring Act, a company undergoing restructuring pursuant to the Restructuring Act may raise financing for its operations during the restructuring phase (including for costs related to the restructuring).

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the relevant Norwegian enforcement authorities following an event of default. However, the position is different for the enforcement of share pledges in a Norwegian limited company: if the share pledge is in accordance with the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act, the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share pledge agreement. Furthermore, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor. ----- The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor, the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings.

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (konkursförvaltare) who is appointed by the competent court will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor's assets and distributing the proceeds amongst the creditors. The purpose of Swedish bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up a Swedish company in such a way that the company's creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is considered best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with mandatory priority rules (see below under the heading ""Priority of certain creditors""). In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the assets of the company and its directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to dispose of the company's assets or assume liabilities or obligations which may be invoked in bankruptcy. The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in bankruptcy may, under certain circumstances, in its discretion, choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts.

Upon obtaining an enforcement order or judgment against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. If (i) agreed between a pledgor and a secured creditor or a party acting as agent on behalf of a secured creditor and (ii) the secured creditor or its agent is in physical possession of the security ----- assets, the secured creditor or the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without having obtained an enforcement order or court judgment. However, where a security holder seeks to enforce such security itself, certain statutory notice requirements apply and the pledgee is under a fiduciary duty to protect the interest of the pledgor when exercising its rights as a secured party or liquidating a secured asset. This duty includes, inter alia, an obligation to notify the pledgor of any liquidation or sale of the collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to the pledgor that portion of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. There are provisions in the Swedish Contracts Act (Lag (1915:218) om avtal och andra rättshandlingar på förmögenhetsrättens _område) which prohibit an enforcing party from foreclosing a secured asset by assuming ownership of the secured asset_ without accounting for the value thereof. Certain categories of properties may however only be enforced through the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Additionally, in respect of a pledge over shares, the secured creditor or its agent may subject to the conditions above, carry out the enforcement and sell the shares through private or public sale or auction. Such process is however subject to certain fiduciary duties and must be carried out in a manner that safeguards the interests of the pledgor. For example the process should include a reasonable notice period before enforcement. There is no set time for such notice period; instead it will depend on the circumstances at hand. Generally, the notice period should be sufficient to allow the pledgor to participate in the sales process or prevent the enforcement by settling the secured obligations and sufficient for potential buyers to be able to make an informed decision in the sales process so that they may place the best possible bid for the shares. However, when determining what is a reasonable notice period, the interests of the secured creditors must also be taken into consideration, where one aspect may be that a delay in enforcement might lead to deterioration of the value of the security. In certain circumstances the fiduciary duty will also mean that the notice period needs to be shortened in the interest of the pledgor to prevent such deterioration. An enforcement in bankruptcy of security over, _inter alia, shares, can in principle be carried out in the same manner as outside bankruptcy (subject to certain statutory notice requirements and mandatory fiduciary duties). A creditor having security over a specific object may demand that such object is sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue delay, provided the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does not, however, apply to property that is necessary for the continuation of the debtor company's business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a composition would become substantially more difficult, provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured creditor. Upon enforcement of security over shares, such shares may, subject to the conditions and certain fiduciary duties as set out above, be sold by the secured creditor or its agent in an auction process. Such process will be subject to certain statutory notice requirements which depend on whether or not the shares are deemed to be financial instruments. In respect of shares which are not financial instruments, the shares may not, unless the receiver in bankruptcy consents otherwise, be sold earlier than four weeks from the day of the court session where the directors testified on the veracity of the accounts (edgångssammanträde) and the receiver in bankruptcy shall be given no less than three weeks prior notice of the auction and be offered to acquire the shares at least one week prior to any enforcement action is taken. In respect of shares which are financial instruments, the secured creditor may sell the shares without such notice periods, provided that the auction is carried out in a commercially prudent manner and that in respect of shares in an unlisted subsidiary of the bankruptcy debtor, after notifying the receiver in bankruptcy and giving the bankruptcy estate the opportunity to acquire the shares. Under Swedish law, the value of the business mortgages issued by a company, which are subject to security in favour of the noteholders, are dependent on the value of the assets held by that company at the time of the enforcement. It shall be noted that, a business mortgage creates a security interest over all movable property (Sw. lös egendom) belonging to the company and connected to the company's business, except for (i) cash and bank funds, (ii) shares and other financial instruments intended for general trading, (iii) property that can be the subject to a security interest due to a mortgage, or (iv) property that can neither be subject to a seizure (Sw. utmätning) nor included in a bankruptcy/insolvency liquidation. The business mortgage gives the creditors a right to succession to 100 per cent of the value of the company's movable assets (with the exceptions set out above), up to an amount equal to the lower of (i) the secured claim, or (ii) 115 per cent of the face amount of the business mortgage certificates, plus interest on such amount from the date of enforcement at a rate corresponding to the official reference rate plus four per cent, provided that claims with higher priority (e.g. which are subject to pledges) have been satisfied.

As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor's assets. However, some preferential and secured ----- creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: ""Specific preferential rights"" and ""General preferential rights."" ""Specific preferential rights"" apply to certain specific property and give a creditor a right to payment from such property. ""General preferential rights"" cover all property belonging to the insolvent company's estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Such preferential and secured creditors may also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (utsökningsbalken (1981:774)), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets (handpanträtt), enforcement through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act.

A corporate reorganization shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended by additional three month periods for up to 15 months in total from the commencement of the reorganization. An administrator (rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors of the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor and provisions which have the effect that one party may terminate, withhold performance, or otherwise change an agreement or the application of an agreement to the detriment of a counterparty as a result of an application for company reorganization or the opening of company reorganization proceedings with respect to that counterparty will not be valid and enforceable. During the corporate reorganization, the debtor's business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the corporate reorganization includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator, and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed.

If an individual is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch individual income tax purposes, income derived from the Notes and gains realized upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes are taxable at the progressive rates (at up to a maximum rate of 49.5%) under the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001, if: (a) the individual is an entrepreneur (ondernemer) and has an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable or the individual has, other than as a shareholder, a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise (medegerechtigde), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or (b) such income or gains qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige _werkzaamheden), which includes activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio_ management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer).

The individual's yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets held by the individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities on 1 January. The individual's deemed return is calculated by multiplying the individual's yield basis with a 'deemed return percentage' (effectief rendementspercentage), which percentage depends on the actual composition of the yield basis, with separate deemed return percentages for savings (banktegoeden), other investments (overige bezittingen) and debts (schulden).

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.2,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.2.2,Payments of Stated Interest,"_Euro-Denominated Stated Interest_ Each payment of ""qualified stated interest"" (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term ""qualified stated interest"" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment based on the ""spot rate"" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under ""—Disposition of Euros""). An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder who receives a stated interest payment denominated in euros (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, ----- for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. _Foreign Tax Credit_ Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be considered income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder's ability to claim foreign tax credits. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

In such event, U.S. Holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when principal payments are made on the Note. In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the ""daily portions"" of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note (""accrued OID""). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ""accrual period"" a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The ""accrual period"" of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note's ""adjusted issue price"" at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under ""—Payments of Stated Interest—Euro-Denominated Stated Interest."" OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such taxable disposition, the amount realized by a U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of the disposition (or based on the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market and taxably disposed of by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the election referred to in the prior sentence will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there ----- are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the ""U.S. dollar cost"" (as defined herein) of the Note to such holder increased by any previously accrued OID. The ""U.S. dollar cost"" of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (or based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described in the two previous paragraphs, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.-source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any which will be treated as discussed above under ""—Payments of Stated _Interest"" or ""—Original Issue Discount,"" as applicable. However, a U.S. Holder will only realize exchange gain or loss_ upon the disposition of a Note (including any exchange gain or loss attributable to the principal amount of a Note and any exchange gain or loss attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID) to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such holder on the disposition.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body.

In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Belgium, formal exequatur proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Belgium according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 et. seq. of the Belgian Code of Private International Law of July 16, 2004 (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé), and provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law, the following documents are produced in court by the claimant seeking enforcement: - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating that the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. In such an action, Belgian procedural rules will apply and the Belgian court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is set out below). However, the court will refuse recognition and enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law, if, among other things: - the rights of defense have not been observed; - the recognition or enforcement in Belgium would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy (such incompatibility being assessed by taking into account, inter alia, the intensity of the connection of the situation with the Belgian legal order and the gravity of the effect produced); - the decision is not final and may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law; it is debated whether a foreign judgment which has been declared provisionally enforceable in the State of origin may, despite being appealable in that State, be enforced in Belgium under Article 23, §4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law; - the judgment was obtained for the sole purpose of avoiding the application of the law which would have been designated on the basis of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (if Belgian courts had ruled on the case), and in a matter in which parties may not deviate from mandatory rules under such applicable law; - the claim was filed in the foreign courts after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter; ----- - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that is susceptible of being recognized in Belgium; - Belgian courts had exclusive jurisdictions in respect of that matter; - the competence of the foreign courts was solely based on the presence in the foreign state of the defendant or of assets with no direct connection with the dispute; or - the decision is in conflict with Belgian rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Belgium judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Note that the Belgian Code of Private International Law contains specific rules for the enforcement of judgements that relate to insolvency matters and that foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the merits of the judgment. As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori).

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it and no other compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at a trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and establishing a debt or being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, statute or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English recognition proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the ----- judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to recognize and enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. In respect of judgments rendered by an English court in a matter where parties have stipulated an exclusive choice of court agreement in their contracts, the final judgment is, as a principal rule, recognized and enforceable in Finland under the Hague Convention in accordance with its provisions. Where the choice of law provision is non-exclusive or exclusive in favour of one counterparty only, a judgment rendered by an English court is as such not enforceable in Finland but a Finnish title for execution (i.e. a Finnish court judgment) is required for such enforcement. In seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of an English court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system. As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. Contractual penalties (regardless of proof of actual damage) are, however, as a general rule enforceable. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.6,Germany,215.6.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - the judgment being final under U.S. law; - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according German law; ----- - whether the defendant who did not appear in the proceedings and who objects to this fact, was duly and timely informed of the proceedings, enabling him to present his defense; - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a judgment of a foreign court recognized by the German court and – in each case handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court; - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the procedure of a matter pending before a German court, provided that such matter was pending before a German court before the U.S. court entered its judgment; - the effects of recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with German public policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity of enforcement of judgments. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is doubtful whether a German court would impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Germany based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. federal and state law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally. German courts also usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, as incompatible with the substantive foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (tingsrätt). Pursuant to the 2012 Brussels Regulation, if a judgement contains a measure or an order which is not known under the laws of the Member State in which the recognition of the judgement is invoked or in which the enforcement of the judgement, the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent possible, be adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has equivalent effects attached to it and which pursues similar aims and interests. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters (the ""Lugano Convention""), a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will provided that a motion for enforcement has been filed and granted with the relevant district court, be enforceable in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Lugano Convention. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, concluded on June 30, 2005 (the ""Hague Convention"") judgments issued by courts in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that are based on exclusive choice of court agreement concluded in civil or commercial matters will, provided that such judgment has effect and is enforceable in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without a retrial on its merits in accordance with, and subject to the exceptions and limitations of, the Hague Convention, and recognition or enforcement may be refused by Swedish courts and executive authorities only on the grounds specified in the Hague Convention. In case any such grounds obtain, or in case a relevant Swedish court determines that there is no exclusive choice of court agreement, a judgement rendered in the courts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland against a Swedish party would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without a retrial on its merits. A judgement entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the 2012 Brussels Regulation), a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention), for example, the United States, or a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is not based on an exclusive choice of court agreement, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on its merits. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by the courts of such state, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgement debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgement rendered by the courts of such a state may be regarded ----- as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability, the translation into Swedish of any relevant document. Further assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. Swedish courts may award judgements or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgement debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgement debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgement creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provision by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kroner. It is not established by Swedish juridical precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish Party giving such powers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The war in Ukraine has destabilized the financial and commodity markets, resulting in an uncertain economic situation in Europe. Boels has only indirect presence in Russia, and no direct presence in Ukraine. Boels does not source from Russia or Ukraine. The Group owns 50% of Fortrent Oy, an equally held joint venture with Ramirent. Fortrent Oy operates in Russia. Boels has no operational involvement in this joint venture, which functions as a stand-alone company in every respect. Fortrent Oy is a construction machinery and equipment rental company operating in Russia. It holds a 100% share in the company Fortrent LLC. As a result of the war in Ukraine, the shareholders decided to end their investment in Russia and to sell the company Fortrent LLC. Considering the level of uncertainty on its business operations in Russia and the high volatility of the Ruble, Boels has fully impaired its investment in Fortrent since 2022.

Effective in June 2023, this transaction resulted in a EUR 51.2 million loan. At June 30, 2023, the balance of the loan equals EUR 48.1 million, presented under Current Financial Liabilities. This transaction is facilitated by the newly created entity Boels Rental Finance B.V., to which the Group holds no voting rights. However, as the Group is exposed to the variability of returns from the performance of Boels Rental Finance B.V. and as Boels Rental Finance B.V.’s operations are dependent on the decisions made by the Group, Boels Rental Finance B.V. is consolidated and included in the Financial Statements of the Group. The accounts receivables are sold to Boels Rental Finance B.V., which is consolidated into the Financial Statements of the Group. As the Group effectively retains the economic ownership of the accounts receivables, the accounts receivables are included in Boels’ financial accounts.

Functional and presentation currency These consolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Euros (EUR/€), which is the Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated. ##### 2.4. Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 _Interim Financial Reporting requires management to make judgements (other than those involving estimations)_ that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported ----- amounts in these consolidated condensed financial statements. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Group evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. These estimates are inherently subject to judgement and actual results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas involving significant estimates and judgements are: - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate and lease term of leases; - Deferred tax assets; - Impairment tests for intangible assets with an indefinite useful life; - Provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets; - Expected useful life and residual value of tangible fixed assets; - Measurement of financial instruments at fair value; - Valuation of financial assets. ##### 3.

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expenses and their resulting receivable/payable positions are denominated in a foreign currency). Boels Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash flows generated in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. Boels Topholding B.V. also incurs currency risk on the net investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. Management has determined, based on a risk assessment, that some of these currency risks need to be hedged. This policy is intended to protect the statement of financial position. Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose. At June 30, 2023 forward exchange contracts are outstanding with a nominal value of EUR 383.0 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 250.3 million). The market value of these contracts amount to EUR 2.5 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 2.4 million).

It is the policy of the Group to have a fixed/floating interest rate profile on the interest bearing liabilities which is fitting with the nature of the Group’s assets. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with the hedging policy. As most of the interest bearing liabilities have a floating interest rate, Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate swaps so that it receives floating ----- interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is determined to obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest positions. To manage interest rate risk, at June 30, 2023 interest rate swaps have been concluded for a nominal amount of EUR 900 million (2022: EUR 900 million), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of these interest rate swaps amount to EUR 80,329 thousand (2022: EUR 84,083 thousand). The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by using level 2 measurement. The valuation technique used discounts the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. As the critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, life and underlying) of the swap contracts and their corresponding hedged item are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The Group uses a hypothetical derivative method for the hedge effectiveness assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness where the critical terms do not match. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and Boels’ own credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in interest rates. The lack of a floor included in certain hedging instruments may cause additional ineffectiveness. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3-month Euribor. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Credit risk mainly arises on cash and cash equivalents and receivable balances from trade and other receivables and other longer-term receivables.

The expected credit losses for these balances were computed based on a 12-month expected credit loss and was estimated to be remote. Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk in trade receivables as a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only made to customers that meet the Group’s credit rating requirements. Goods and services are sold subject to payment terms, the majority ranging between 15 to 60 days. A different payment period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded, including guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms per customer. Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored and legal action is taken against debtors with long outstanding balances. The exposure to long-outstanding balances exceeding the post-paid terms are however not considered to be significant. The Group applies IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade receivables. The expected credit losses are estimated primarily by virtue of a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available credit facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. ##### 8.

The Group presented its previous consolidated financial statements up to December 31, 2021 in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code (NL GAAP). The transition disclosures are presented in note 30. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis unless otherwise indicated. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as ‘value in use’ in IAS 36 and ‘net realisable value’ in IAS 2. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.

Land and buildings are originally stated at historical cost plus expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition thereof. Other assets are valued at historical cost, where the manufacturing price is comprised of the cost of raw materials and consumables and also includes expenditure directly attributable to an asset’s manufacturing, including installation costs. Expenditure incurred subsequently for major services, additions to or replacements of parts of property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.

The brand name has been measured during the purchase price allocation applying the relief-of-royalty method. _Customer Contracts_ In past business combinations before the transition to IFRS, part of the purchase price has been allocated to customer contracts. The initial measurement of these customer contracts was determined by applying the multi-period excess earnings method and the forecasted revenues and profits related to these contracts. _Software_ The software is acquired from external vendors.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised initially in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate or joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. On acquisition of the investment in an associate or a joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired. ----- When a Group entity transacts with an associate or a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate or joint venture are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate or joint venture that are not related to the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. _Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill_ At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its i Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cashgenerating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss to the extent that it eliminates the impairment loss which has been recognised for the asset in prior years. _Equity accounted investments_ The net investment in an equity accounted investment is assessed for impairment if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment (a ‘loss event’). An impairment loss is only incurred if that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. When objective evidence of impairment exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Items of property, plant and equipment that were previously held for rental to others are transferred to inventories for disposal at their carrying value when they cease to be rented.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component which are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. _Classification of financial assets_ Financial asset debt instruments that meet the following conditions are classified as being measured subsequently at amortised cost: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The amortised cost of financial assets that are classified as such, are determined in accordance with the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The Group’s financial asset debt instruments consists mainly of trade receivables, other receivables, loans and cash and cash equivalents. _Trade receivables_ Trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, are measured initially at the transaction price as determined in accordance with IFRS 15. Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Other receivables_ Other receivables relate to unbilled revenue accruals and contract assets. Other receivables are initially measured at the transaction price as determined in accordance with IFRS 15 and subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Loans_ Loans relate to loans to associates, participants and related parties. Loans are measured initially at fair value and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Cash and cash equivalents are measured initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses are estimated primarily by virtue of a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date. The Group also provides for a lifetime ECL on specific trade and other receivable balances based on individual assessment. For loans, the Group recognises a lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial assets with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account. Financial assets are written-off against the loss allowance account when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the estimated ECL is insignificant. _Classification of financial liabilities_ All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s financial liabilities consists mainly of trade and other payables, bank- and other loans. _Trade and other payables_ Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. ----- _Borrowings_ Bank and other loans are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Derivative financial instruments_ The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. Refer to note 3.10 for the accounting policy on hedge accounting. _Equity Instruments_ An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of the Group relates mainly to ordinary shares issued. _Share capital_ Share capital represents the nominal (par) value of issued shares. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.87,3.10 Hedge accounting,215.87.1,,"The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in hedges of net investments in foreign operations, or cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements: - There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. - The effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship. - The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. The group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward contract (i.e. including the forward elements) as the hedging instrument for all of its hedging relationships involving forward contracts. If the hedged item is time-period related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss on a rational basis – the Group applies straight-line amortisation. Those reclassified amounts are recognised in profit or loss in the same line as the hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost of hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Note 28 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. _Cash flow hedges_ The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘Other gains and losses’ line item. ----- Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified immediately to profit or loss. _Hedges of net investments in foreign operations_ Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

The right-of-use assets are presented separately in note 5. The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. As a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has elected the practical expedient to account for lease - and non-lease components (within a lease) as a single lease component for its vehicle leases. The Group has not elected the expedient for its real-estate and rental fleet leases and accounts for lease- and non-lease components separately. The Group has also elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases (12 months or less).

In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy at the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. Levels used in the hierarchy are as follows: Level 1: Fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2: Fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques which use inputs that are based on observable market data. Level 3: Fair values that are determined on the basis of valuation techniques which use inputs that are not based on observable market data. _Financial instruments at fair value_ Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value using level 2 measurement. The valuation technique used is based on observable market data and is provided by the offering financing institutes. _Financial instruments at amortised cost_ The majority of the Group financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The fair values of these instruments are not materially different from their carrying values, since the instruments are either short-term in nature or the interest rates are on market terms. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Lease duration generally varies from several days to a few months. Damage waiver’s taken up by customers do not transfer a separate service and are accounted for as part of, and over a consistent period with, the associated with the rental. _Sales and other services_ Other contract components, or contracts which do not pertain to equipment rental, are recognised as revenue at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer (for sales) or as the performance obligation is satisfied (for other services).

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. _Retirement benefits_ The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.

The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable. ----- _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. _Current tax and deferred tax for the year_ Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

CGU’s are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each group of CGU to its recoverable amount. Scandinavia The recoverable amount of the Scandinavia CGU, is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period and a post-tax discount rate of 9.1% per annum (2021: 6.3% per annum) calculated by the weighted average cost of capital method as derived through the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The pre-tax discount rate equals 10.9% (2021: 7.4%). The key assumptions used by management in setting the financial forecasts for the initial five-year period were as follows: _Forecast sales growth rates_ Forecast sales growth rates are based on past experience adjusted for a continued strong growth rate as historically seen. Revenue is expected to grow at 2.2%. _Operating profits_ Operating profits are forecasted based on historical experience of operating margins adjusted for the impact of market expectations. _Cash conversion_ Cash conversion is the ratio of operating cash flows to operating profit. Management forecasts cash conversion rates based on historical experience. Finland and Baltics The recoverable amount of the Finland and Baltics CGU, is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period and a post-tax discount rate of 9.8% per annum (2021: 6.7% per annum) calculated by the weighted average cost of capital method as derived through the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The pre-tax discount rate equals 11.8% (2021: 7.9%). The key assumptions used by management in setting the financial forecasts for the initial five-year period were as follows: _Forecast sales growth rates_ Forecast sales growth rates are based on past experience adjusted for a continued strong growth rate as historically seen.

Management forecasts cash conversion rates based on historical experience. _Sensitivity analysis_ The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each of the group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the CGUs are based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the related CGUs. Based on the impairment analysis no impairment was recognized as at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 or 1 January 2021. _Impairment_ For the purpose of impairment testing, no impairment was identified as at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 or 1 January 2021 following the Group’s annual impairment test on Goodwill.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.153,28 Capital and financial risk management,215.153.1,,"_Capital management_ For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes share capital and all other equity reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group’s objectives in managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns and benefits to stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may return capital to shareholders, decrease or increase borrowings or issue new shares. The primary source of the Group’s liquidity is cash generated from operations. These funds are generally used to fund capital expenditures and pay interest and taxes. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s aim is for a financing structure that ensures continuing operations and minimises cost of equity. For this, flexibility and access to the financial markets are important conditions. The Group monitors its financing structure using a gearing ratio, among other factors. The Group has a gearing ratio of 321 per cent (see below) per 31 December 2022 determined as the proportion of net debt to equity. The gearing ratio at the year-end is as follows: (x €1,000) 31-12-2022 31-12-2021 Debt 1,647,382 1,634,768 Cash and cash equivalents 17,192 62,158 Net debt **1,630,190** **1,572,610 Equity 508,571 350,564 Net debt to equity ratio 321% 449% Debt is defined as long- and short-term borrowings and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives and financial guarantee contracts). Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group that are managed as capital. _Financial risk management_ The Group’s principal financial assets include trade receivables, derivatives, other long-term receivables and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other payables as well as lease liabilities. The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Group does not have a formal financial risk management policy program. Instead the susceptibility of the Group to financial risks is monitored as a part of its daily management of the business. ----- _Market Risk_ The group is exposed to market risk mainly as a result of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency (i.e. foreign currency risk) and its exposure to interest bearing liabilities such as loans (i.e. interest rate risk). _Foreign currency risk_ Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expenses and their resulting receivable/payable positions are denominated in a foreign currency). Boels Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash flows generated in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. Boels Topholding B.V. also incurs currency risk on the net investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. Management has determined, based on a risk assessment, that some of these currency risks need to be hedged. This policy is intended to protect the statement of financial position. Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose. At 31 December 2022 forward exchange contracts are outstanding with a nominal value of € 250.3 million (2021: € 118.5 million). The market value of these contracts amount to € 2.4 million (2021: € (1.3 million)). The Group applies hedge accounting with respect to the most material foreign exchange contracts. _Interest rate risk_ The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. It is the policy of the Group to have a fixed/floating interest rate profile on the interest bearing liabilities which is fitting with the nature of the Group’s assets. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with the hedging policy. As most of the interest bearing liabilities have a floating interest rate, Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate swaps so that it receives floating interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is determined to obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest positions. To manage interest rate risk, at 31 December 2022 interest rate swaps have been concluded for a nominal amount of € 900 million (2021: € 900 million), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of these interest rate swaps amount to € 84,083 thousand (2021: € 6,288 thousand). The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. As the critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, life and underlying) of the swap contracts and their corresponding hedged item are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The Group uses a hypothetical derivative method for the hedge effectiveness assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness where the critical terms do not match. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and Boels’ own credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in interest rates. The lack of a floor included in certain hedging instruments may cause additional ineffectiveness. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3-month Euribor. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss. ----- _Credit risk_ Credit risk is the risk that the Group faces when a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk mainly arises on cash and cash equivalents and receivable balances from trade and other receivables and other longer-term receivables. A summary of amounts exposed to credit risk is presented below: (x €1,000) Notes 31-12-2022 31-12-2021 01-01-2021 Non-current loans receivable 8 2,451 2,402 4,819 Trade receivables 10 210,396 194,078 170,995 Other receivables 10 31,097 28,140 19,760 Cash and cash equivalents 11 17,192 62,158 151,337 Substantially all cash at bank is held with high credit quality financial institutions with credit rating of A- (S&P) or higher. As at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 1 January 2021, no significant increase in credit risk has occurred with respect to the above noted non-current loans receivable. The expected credit losses for these balances were computed based on a 12-month expected credit loss and was estimated to be remote. Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk in trade receivables as a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only made to customers that meet the Group’s credit rating requirements. Goods and services are sold subject to payment terms, the majority ranging between 15 to 60 days. A different payment period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded, including guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms per customer. Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored and legal action is taken against debtors with long outstanding balances. The exposure to long-outstanding balances exceeding the post-paid terms are however not considered to be significant. The Group applies IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade receivables. The expected credit losses are estimated primarily by virtue of a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date. _Liquidity risk_ Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available credit facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.155,30 First time adoption of IFRS,215.155.1,,"These consolidated financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2022, are the first the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. For periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP. ----- Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable as at 31 December 2022, together with the comparative period data for the year ended 31 December 2021. In preparing the financial statements, the Group’s opening statement of financial position was prepared as at 1 January 2021, the Group’s date of transition to IFRS. This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its Dutch GAAP financial statements, including the statement of financial position as at 1 January 2021 and the financial statements as of, and for, the year ended 31 December 2021. _Exemptions applied_ IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS 1’) allows some exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under IFRS. _Business combinations_ IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to either acquisitions of subsidiaries that are considered businesses under IFRS, or acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures that occurred before 1 January 2021. Use of this exemption means that the Dutch GAAP carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under IFRS, are their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with IFRS. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under IFRS are excluded from the opening IFRS statement of financial position. The Group did not recognise any assets or liabilities that were not recognised under Dutch GAAP or excluded any previously recognised amounts as a result of IFRS recognition requirements. IFRS 1 also requires that the Dutch GAAP carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening IFRS statement of financial position (apart from adjustments for goodwill impairment and the recognition or derecognition of intangible assets). In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has tested goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to IFRS. _The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates_ The Group has not applied IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill from business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS. Such fair value adjustments and goodwill are treated as assets and liabilities of the parent rather than as assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore, those assets and liabilities are already expressed in the functional currency of the parent or are non-monetary foreign currency items and no further translation differences occur. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero _Leases_ The Group assessed all contracts existing at 1 January 2021 to determine whether a contract contains a lease based upon the conditions in place as at 1 January 2021. Lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2021. Right-of-use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before 1 January 2021. The lease payments associated with leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of transition to IFRS and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value have been recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. _Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures_ If the subsidiary (or associate or joint venture) became a first-time adopter of IFRS before the parent of the Group, in the parent’s consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary (or associate or joint venture) is measured at the same amounts as in the subsidiary’s (or associate’s or joint venture’s) financial statements (after adjusting for consolidation and equity accounting adjustments and for the effects of the business combination in which the entity acquired the subsidiary). _Revenue_ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers has not been applied to revenue contract that occurred before 1 January 2021. The use of this exemption means that the transition date per IFRS 1 is used as the IFRS 15 date of initial application therefore the Group is not required to restate contracts that were completed before the transition date. Thus, the Group applies the IFRS 15 standard from 1 January 2021. _Estimates_ The estimates at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with Dutch GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies). The estimates used by the Group to present these amounts in accordance with IFRS reflect conditions at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021. ----- _Reconciliation between Dutch GAAP and IFRS_ Group reconciliation of equity as at 1 January 2021, date of transition to IFRS. Dutch GAAP figures have been reclassified to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. (x €1,000) Notes _Equity_ (x €1,000) Notes _Assets_",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

Goodwill Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill was capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is required to be capitalised, however, no amortisation thereof takes place. The amortisation for the periods presented have therefore been reversed within profit or loss. The impact is a reversal of € 46.533 thousand amortisation for the year ended 31 December 2021. B. Leases At the date of transition to IFRS, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (12 months or less). As at 1 January 2021: - Right-of-use assets of € 186,676 thousand were recognised (31 December 2021: € 230,501 thousand); - Lease liabilities of € 183,873 thousand were recognised (31 December 2021: ) Items that may be reclassified to profit and loss, net of tax - - Share of other comprehensive income of joint venture - - Fair value gain/(loss) arising on hedging instruments during the period H - 6,288 6,288 Cumulative (gain)/loss arising on hedging instruments reclassified to profit and loss - - Exchange differences on translation of foreign operation F 2,452 (12,638) (10,185)",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

C. Trade and other receivables The adoption of IFRS has fundamentally changed the Group’s accounting for impairment losses for financial assets by replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forwardlooking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS requires the Group to recognise an allowance for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and contract assets. At the date of transition to IFRS, the application of the ECL approach did not have an impact on the impairment loss allowance recognised previously under Dutch GAAP for trade and other receivables as well as other long term receivables. D. Revenue Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business were recognised on a net (agent) basis. The application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of revenue on a gross (principle) basis and accordingly an increase in revenue recognised in the 2021 financial year. E. Deferred tax The various transitional adjustments results in different temporary differences. Deferred tax adjustments are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction in retained earnings. F. Foreign currency translation Under Dutch GAAP, the Group recognised translation differences on foreign operations in a separate component of equity. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2021. The resulting adjustment was recognised against retained earnings. G. Statement of cash flows Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as cash outflows from financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities increased by € 53,819 thousand and cash outflows from financing activities increased by the same amount for the year ended 31 December 2021. H.

During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Board of Directors exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We note that management has not formalised its fraud risk assessment and fraud management strategy. We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control, including internal fraud & integrity protocols and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, and bribery and corruption, where deemed necessary, in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due fraud is present. We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures: _•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to management override of controls:_ We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud as management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management’s assumed ability to manipulate ----- affecting the financial statements. We have pinpointed the possible incentives of management on meeting the loan covenants and the long term and yearly bonus plan for the strategic board members. In this respect EBITDA serves as the key performance indicator for the entity and management. _•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition:_ We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition. This risk relates to the occurrence of revenues for non-transactional rental revenue transactions. To respond to these fraud risks we performed the following procedures: - We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives from the strategic board, directors, finance employees, risk manager and the general counsel. - We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting. - We evaluated all internally registered fraud instances in financial year 2022 and evaluated whether management’s follow up is appropriate. - We have performed data analytics, including detailed testing of journal entries in the financial administration (SAP/IBS) based on certain risk-based characteristics, as part of our audit approach to address fraud risks. - We performed supplementary substantive audit procedures, such as detailed testing of top-down journal entries. - We have reconciled the rental- and financial system on detailed level and performed extensive sampling testing on revenue postings not orginating from the rental system and on the accrual of customer bonusses. - We have included the fraud risks as specific focus area in the group instructions to the component audit teams and have conducted site visits on a number of business locations in Sweden, Norway and Finland. - We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.

As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from noncompliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and regulations: adherence to (corporate) tax law and financial reporting regulations, the requirements under the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect on the financial statements as an integrated part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the related financial statements. We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and regulations generally recognized to have a direct effect on the financial statements. Apart from these, the Boels Topholding B.V. is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance, through imposing fines or litigation. Given the nature of Boels Topholding B.V.’s business and the complexity of the act on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (‘WWFT’), and current EU sanctions with regards to the joint venture in Russia, there could be a risk of non-compliance with the requirements of such laws and regulations. In addition, we considered major laws and regulations applicable to listed companies. Our procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to Boels Topholding B.V.’s ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties (e.g., compliance with the terms of operating licenses and permits or compliance with environmental regulations) and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of management, the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and others within Boels Topholding B.V.’s as to whether the Boels Topholding B.V. is in compliance with such laws and regulations and (ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the i ----- Naturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE INCOME STATEMENT #### 3.1 GENERAL INFORMATION Profit or loss is determined as the difference between the realisable value of the goods delivered and services rendered, and the costs and other charges for the year. Revenues on transactions are recognised in the year in which they are realised. Profit or loss is determined, taking into account the recognition of unrealised changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges.

Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose. At December 31, 2020 forward exchange contracts (EURSEK and EURNOK) are outstanding with a nominal value of EUR 129.3 million. Boels Topholding B.V. also incurs currency risk on the net investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate swaps for its variable interest liabilities (loans), so that it receives floating interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is determined to obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest positions. To determine the amounts and duration of financial derivatives the Company monitors the interest balance. On the debit side of the interest balance, the assets which need to be covered are mentioned. On the ----- credit side of the balance the equity, provisions and concluded interest derivatives are mentioned. To cover interest risks at 31 December 2020 interest rate swaps have been concluded for a nominal amount of € 180 million (31-12-2019: € 180 million), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of these interest rate swaps amount to € 8,989k negative (31-12-2019: € 8,718k negative). In February 2021 we’ve closed out our existing interest rate swaps, amounting to € 180 million against € 8.4 million cash settlement. Subsequently we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with ABN-Amro, BNP, ING and Rabobank for a total amount of € 900 million. These transactions are 1 year forward starting and have a term until February 2026. They have an average rate of 0.174% and include a floor at 0%. #### 4.2 CREDIT RISK Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk, this as a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only made to customers that meet the Company’s credit rating. Goods and services are sold subject to payment deadlines, the majority ranging between 15 till 60 days. A different payment period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded, including guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms per customer. #### 4.3 LIQUIDITY RISK On February 6, 2020 the company has successfully concluded a 7 years syndicate facility agreement with a banking consortium. Subsequent to the Cramo acquisition this financing arrangement has been amended and syndicated to the market by the end of June 2020. After amendment, this agreement consisted of the following facilities: - a € 1.335 million Term Loan B with a term of 7 years; - a € 275.5 million amortizing (5%) Loan A with a term of 6.5 years; - a € 200 million Revolving Credit Facility with a term of 6.5 years, the purpose of this facility is to finance working capital and capital expenditures. The loan agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, typical to such agreements, primarily related to the leverage for the group as a whole. The group calculated various scenarios also taking into account the Covid-19 situation. Based on these scenarios management is comfortable with the compliance of the agreed covenants and liquidity for the group as a whole. At the end of March 2020 all existing finance agreements which consisted of an unsecured credit facility agreement with a total credit line of € 210 million and an unsecured financing in amount of € 413,5 million via the German Schuldschein Darlehen market, have been repaid in advanced. ----- ### 5.

Allowance is made for any impairment losses expected. A loss qualifies as an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset (or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs) exceeds its recoverable amount. For details on how to determine whether an intangible asset has to be impaired, please refer to note 2.8 below. _Goodwill_ Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated future useful life. Goodwill is amortised in 5 to 10 years and is dependent on the expected useful life. The useful life concerned is dependent on multiple factors such as plans for integration in the Boels organisation, the market position of the acquired company and the expected duration of the economic benefits. The CRAMO goodwill is amortized over 10 years given CRAMO’s market position, the expected economic benefits and CRAMO Group is acting as a relative standalone group within the Boels organization. The estimated future useful life of goodwill of small acquisitions is most often 5 years, as corresponding depots will be relatively quickly be fully integrated into the Boels operations. At acquired smaller companies, the staff turnover is often high. For this reason the initial estimated useful life of goodwill has an economic life of 10 years (and in most cases a maximum of 5 years). _Brand name_ The Brand name ‘CRAMO’ is acquired during the acquisition of CRAMO in 2020. The brand name has been measured during the purchase price allocation applying the relief- of-royalty method.

An asset is subject to impairment, if its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on the active market. An impairment loss is directly expensed in the income statement. If it is established that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer applies or has declined, the increased carrying amount of the assets in question is not set any higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no asset impairment been recognised.

Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income taxes are recognised at face value. _Pension benefits management board_ At the 23rd of December 2019, the management board converted the self-administrated defined benefit pension plan to a fiscal old-age reserve (FOR).

The new fiscal old-age reserve, which compounds annually at the average U-return published by the Dutch Tax Authority, is presented in the balance sheet and corresponds with the present fiscal value.

1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,3108,INCOME STATEMENTS,3108.66,Audit approach fraud risks,3108.66.1,,"We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Board of Directors exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We reported to the Board of Directors the company has not formalized its fraud risk assessment and fraud management strategy. We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control, including internal fraud & integrity protocols and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures: _•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to management override of controls:_ We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud as management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management’s assumed ability to manipulate accounting records by overriding controls and include intentional bias in estimates affecting the financial statements. We have pinpointed the possible incentives of management on meeting the loan covenants and the long term and yearly bonus plan for the strategic board members. In this respect EBITDA serves as the key performance indicator for the entity and management. _•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition:_ We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition. This risk relates to the occurrence and correct period cut-off of revenues for nonstandard rental revenue transactions. To respond to these fraud risks we performed the following procedures: - We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives from the strategic board, directors, finance employees, risk manager and the general counsel. - We tested the appropriateness and business rationale of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial ----- - We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting. - We evaluated all internally registered fraud instances in financial year 2021 and evaluated of management’s follow up is appropriate. - For significant transactions such as refinancing and restructuring we evaluated whether the business rationale of the transactions suggests that they may have been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to conceal misappropriation of assets. - We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the financial statements indicate a possible bias that may reflect a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, estimates and assumptions that have a major impact on the financial statements are disclosed in note 1.7 of the financial statements. We also performed a retrospective review of management judgments and assumptions related to material accounting estimates reflected in prior year financial statement, such as the depreciation rates, valuation and impairment triggers of intangible and tangible assets. - We have performed extensive sampling testing on revenue postings not orginating from the rental system and performed extensive procedures to determine appropriate period cut-off of the revenue in the financial statements. - We have included fraud as a specific focus area in the group instructions to the component audit teams and have conducted site visits on a number of business locations to Sweden and Finland. - We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or noncompliance. Our audit procedures for the year as specified in this paragraph did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453

These i In the second category, we considered other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance, through imposed fines or litigation. This category includes regulations related to the act on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (‘WWFT’). Our procedures are more limited with respect to laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may however be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to Boels Topholding B.V.’s ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility for these matters that indirectly impact the financial statement is limited to: (i) inquiry of the Board of Directors, the risk manager, legal counsel and others within the Company as to whether the Company is in compliance with such laws and regulations, and (ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. (iii) request and obtain written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.

As part of our procedures, we evaluated whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained regarding, and have concluded on, the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of Boels Topholding B.V. in accordance with the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Auditors, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. #### B. REPORT ON THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL REPORT In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the financial report 2020 contains other information that consists of: - The directors’ report; - Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; - contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of the directors’ report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. ----- #### C.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,453
1727_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,3109,IDENTIFIED LIABILITIES,3109.33,Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements,3109.33.1,,"Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others.: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control; - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; - Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern; - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and - Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ----- Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit.
