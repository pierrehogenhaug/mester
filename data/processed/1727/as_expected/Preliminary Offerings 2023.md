**Confirmation of your representation: In order to be eligible to view the attached Offering Memorandum or**
make an investment decision with respect to the securities described therein, investors must be either (1) QIBs or (2)
persons purchasing the securities outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S; provided
that, investors resident in a member state of the EEA or the United Kingdom must be qualified investors within the meaning
of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation or Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation (as applicable). The attached
Offering Memorandum is being sent at your request. By accepting the e-mail or other electronic transmission and accessing
the Offering Memorandum, you shall be deemed to have represented to us and each of the Initial Purchasers (as defined in
the attached Offering Memorandum) that:

(1) you consent to the delivery of the Offering Memorandum by electronic transmission; and

(2) you and any customers you represent:

(a) are QIBs; or

(b) are outside the United States and that the e-mail address that you gave us and to which the
electronic transmission has been delivered is not located in the United States, its territories and


-----

possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake
Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any state of the United States or the District of
Columbia; and

(3) if you are resident in a member state of the EEA or the United Kingdom, you are a qualified investor as
defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation and U.K. Prospectus Regulation, respectively, and not a retail
investor as defined below for the EEA and the U.K., respectively.

Prospective purchasers who are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under the Offering
Memorandum may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by
Rule 144A.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs (as defined below) Only Target Market:**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is
eligible counterparties ("ECPs") and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended
("MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. The
target market and distribution channels may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes
in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a
"distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject
to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the
purposes of this paragraph, the term "manufacturers" shall mean such of the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the product
governance rules under MiFID II.

**PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA (as defined herein) Retail Investors: The securities**
described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a "retail investor" means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering,
selling or distributing the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared, and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any member state of the
EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an
offer of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum in a member state of the EEA may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer (as defined in the attached Offering Memorandum) or any of the
Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation
to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer
of the securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
for such offer.

**U.K. MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of each U.K. manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities
described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook ("COBS"), and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, "U.K. MiFIR"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a "U.K. **distributor") should take into consideration the U.K. manufacturers' target market assessment;**
however, a U.K. distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the
"U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
such securities (by either adopting or refining the U.K. manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "U.K. manufacturers" shall mean such of
the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the product governance rules under COBS and U.K. MiFIR.

**U.K. PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to U.K. Retail Investors:** The securities described in the
Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold


-----

or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a "retail investor" means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the "EUWA") or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA") and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of U.K. MiFIR;. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
"U.K. PRIIPs Regulation") for offering, selling or distributing the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering,
selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may
be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the United Kingdom
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the U.K. Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum in
the United Kingdom may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial
Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 85 of the FSMA, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the
Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the securities in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such
offer.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering Memorandum to any other
person.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for
distribution only to (i) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article
19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the "Financial
**Promotion Order"), (ii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) ("high net worth companies, unincorporated**
associations, etc.") of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom or (iv) persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA in connection
with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such
persons together being referred to as "Relevant Persons"). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons
and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to
which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant
Persons.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be
made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker
or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf
of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities
other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted
electronically may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial
Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, the Group (each term, as defined in the attached
Offering Memorandum), any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities
or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering
Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and any other version available to you on request from the Initial
Purchasers.

The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to completion and
amendment (which may be material) without notice. The Offering Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to, constitute
or contain an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy and may not be used as, or in connection with an offer to sell
or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described therein.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**


**NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


###### Boels Topholding B.V. €400,000,000      % Senior Secured Notes due 2029

Boels Topholding B.V., a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands with
its corporate seat (statutaire zetel) in Sittard-Geleen, the Netherlands and registered with the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel) under number
60885602 (the "Issuer" or "Boels"), is offering (the "Offering") €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its     % Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the "Notes"). The Notes will be
issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") to be dated on or about     , 2023 (the "Issue Date"), between, among others, the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below), BNY
Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., as security agent (the "Security Agent").

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date, payable semi-annually in arrear on      and      of each year, commencing on    , 2024. The Notes will mature
on       , 2029. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after     , 2025 at the redemption prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the
"Offering Memorandum"). At any time prior to     , 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a "make-whole" premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum, to, but excluding,
the redemption date. Prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may redeem on one or more occasions up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional
Notes (as defined herein)) using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to     % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided that, at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes)
remains outstanding after the redemption. Prior to     , 2025, the Issuer may during each twelve month period following the Issue Date redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In addition, in connection with any tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered
to each other holder of such Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
"Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption." Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at the purchase prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. See "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of
_Control" and "—Limitation on Asset Sales."_

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and, on the Issue Date, will be guaranteed on a senior secured
basis (the "Guarantees" and, each, a "Guarantee") by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer incorporated in Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway
and Sweden (collectively, the "Guarantors," and each of them, a "Guarantor"). The Guarantors will also guarantee the Existing Senior Facilities (as defined herein) on a pari passu basis.
On or about the Issue Date, subject to the terms of the security documents, the Agreed Security Principles and applicable perfection requirements, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
secured by (a) the issued shares, certain material bank accounts and material structural intercompany receivables of the Issuer, (b) material structural intercompany receivables owed to
P.B.K. NV (the "Parent") by the Issuer or any material subsidiary, (c) the issued shares, certain material bank accounts and certain material structural intercompany receivables of the
Guarantors and (d) substantially all assets of each Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales, substantially all inventory, machinery, plant, trade receivables, vehicles and construction
machines of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (in each case, by way of a floating charge) and substantially all movable assets of each Guarantor incorporated in Finland and Sweden
(by way of a business mortgage) (collectively, the "Collateral"). The Collateral also secures the Existing Senior Facilities on a pari passu basis.

The Notes and the Guarantees will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the
existing and future obligations of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, including
obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities, and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the existing and future obligations that are expressly subordinated in right of payment. The
Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively senior to all of the existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, that are not secured by the Collateral, to the
extent of the value of such Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors that are secured by property or assets
that do not also secure the Notes and the Guarantees, to the extent of the value of such property or assets securing such other obligations. The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to all of the existing and future obligations (including trade payables) of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not provide Guarantees. The Guarantees and the security interests in
the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to
secure future indebtedness. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security and the liability of the Guarantors will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the "Authority") for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"). The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive
2014/65/EU, as amended, or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.
Settlement of the Notes is not conditional on such admission. The Exchange is a market designated for professional investors. The Authority has not approved or verified the contents of
this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes will be in registered form and will initially be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be
represented on issue by one or more global notes, which will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, S.A. ("Clearstream")
on or about the Issue Date. Interests in a global note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See "Book-Entry; Delivery and Form."


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 28.**

**Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and therefore may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant**

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM**

This Offering Memorandum is a confidential document that the Issuer (together with its subsidiaries, "we," the
"Group," the "Boels Group," "us" or "our") is providing only to prospective purchasers of the Notes. You should read
this Offering Memorandum before making a decision whether to purchase any Notes. You must not:

    - use this Offering Memorandum for any other purpose;

    - make copies of any part of this Offering Memorandum or give a copy of it to any other person; or

    - disclose any information in this Offering Memorandum to any other person, other than a person retained
to advise you in connection with the purchase of the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy by anyone in
any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such
offer or solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would
be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and this Offering
Memorandum may not be distributed in any jurisdiction except in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in
such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell the Notes or
possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum, and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals. Neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers (as defined below) shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements.

This Offering is being made in the United States in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act for offers and sales of securities which do not involve a public offering, including Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or
the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and therefore may not be offered or sold within
the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction. If you purchase
the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under
"Notice to Investors." The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or other
jurisdiction pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. You may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment
in the Notes for an indefinite period. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are making an offer to sell the Notes in any
jurisdiction where the offer and sale of the Notes is prohibited.

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), any U.S. state securities commission,
non-U.S. securities authority or other authority has approved or disapproved of the Notes or determined if this Offering
Memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

In making an investment decision, prospective purchasers of the Notes must rely on their own examination of the
Issuer and the terms of the Offering as described in this Offering Memorandum, including the merits and risks involved.
In addition, neither the Issuer nor any Initial Purchaser nor any of their respective representatives is making any
representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes, and you should not construe anything in this
Offering Memorandum as investment, legal, business, tax or other advice. In accordance with normal and accepted market
practice, neither the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, nor the Transfer
Agent (each as defined below) is responsible for the contents of this Offering Memorandum or expresses any opinion as to
the merits of the Notes under this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer, and not the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Group's directors, has ultimate authority over
the statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the content of those statements and whether and how to
communicate them. You should consult your own advisors as to legal, business, tax, financial and related aspects of an
investment in the Notes. You must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell the
Notes or possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum, and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals;
neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal, regulatory or other
requirements.

The information contained in this Offering Memorandum is as of the date hereof. Neither the delivery of this
Offering Memorandum at any time after the date of publication nor any subsequent commitment to purchase the Notes
shall, under any circumstances, create an implication that there has been no change in the information set forth in this
Offering Memorandum or in the Issuer since the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**Notice to Certain Investors**

**United States**

In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and
agreements. See "Notice to Investors." This Offering Memorandum is being provided to investors (i) in the United States
that the Issuer reasonably believes to be QIBs under Rule 144A for informational use solely in connection with their
consideration of the purchase of the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Securities”) and (ii) outside the United States in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Its use for any other purpose in the United States is not authorized.
It may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part nor may it be distributed or any of its contents disclosed to anyone
other than the prospective investors to whom it is originally submitted. Until 40 days after the commencement of this
Offering, an offer or sale of the Securities within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering)
may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with an available exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act.

This Offering is being made in the United States in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act for offers and sales of securities which do not involve a public offering, including Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act. Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Securities may be relying on the exemption from
the registration requirements of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Securities may be offered
and sold outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have
the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Securities have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the SEC, any state securities
commission in the United States or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC, any state
securities commission in the United States or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or
adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for
distribution only to (i) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article
19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the "Financial
**Promotion Order"), (ii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) ("high net worth companies, unincorporated**
associations, etc.") of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom or (iv) persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) (the "FSMA") in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as "Relevant Persons"). This
Offering Memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to
Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

**_U.K. MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:_** Solely for the
purposes of each U.K. manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook ("COBS"), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, "U.K. MiFIR");
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "U.K. **distributor") should take into consideration the**
U.K. manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a U.K. distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the "U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules") is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the U.K. manufacturers'
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term
"U.K. manufacturers" shall mean such of the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the product governance rules under COBS
and U.K. MiFIR.

**_U.K. PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to U.K. Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered,_**
sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in
the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the "EUWA") or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as


-----

a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of U.K. MiFIR. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "U.K.
**PRIIPs Regulation") for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors**
in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as amended and as it forms part of the U.K.
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "U.K. Prospectus Regulation") from a requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant
to section 85 of the FSMA, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for
the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

**European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs (as defined below) Only Target Market:_**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties ("ECPs") and professional
clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended ("MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channels may vary in relation
to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "manufacturers" shall mean
such of the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the product governance rules under MiFID II.

**_PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered,_**
sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently,
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the "PRIIPs Regulation"), for
offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared, and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of the
EEA that is subject to the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended (the "EU Prospectus Regulation") will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly,
any person making or intending to make an offer of the Notes in a member state of the EEA may only do so in circumstances
in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of
the EU Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

**_Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in Austria: The Offering is not a public offering in the Republic of_**
Austria. The Notes may not be offered and sold in the Republic of Austria except in accordance with the provisions of the
Austrian Capital Markets Act 2019 (Kapitalmarktgesetz 2019) (as amended, the "Austrian Capital Markets Act"), of the
EU Prospectus Regulation (as defined below), and any other laws applicable in the Republic of Austria. This offering
memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the Austrian Financial
Markets Authority (Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde) ("FMA"). FMA has not obtained and will not obtain a notification from
another competent authority of a Member State, with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article
25 of the EU Prospectus Regulation (as defined below). The Notes must not be distributed within Austria by way of a
public offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document relating
to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Austria or used in connection
with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Austria. Consequently, in Austria the Notes will only be available
to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who
are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Article 2 e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation (as


-----

defined below). The Notes will not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in Austria. For the
purpose of this clause, a "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11)
of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU ("MiFID II"); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Any
resale of the Notes in Austria may only be made in accordance with the Austrian Capital Markets Act, the EU Prospectus
Regulation (as defined below) and other applicable laws.

provisions of the Securities Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended,
the "German Securities Prospectus Act"), of the EU Prospectus Regulation (as defined below), and any other laws
applicable in Germany. This offering memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be
approved by, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt fur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht)
("BaFin"). BaFin has not obtained and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a Member State,
with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article 25 of the EU Prospectus Regulation (as defined
below). The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public offer, public advertisement or in any similar
manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document relating to the Notes, as well as information contained
therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the
public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any
other offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger)
within the meaning of Section 2 No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may

    - the audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, of the Group as of and for the
financial year ended December 31, 2020 (the "FY 2020 Financial Statements").

The FY 2022 Financial Statements, the FY 2021 Financial Statements and the FY 2020 Financial Statements are
herein collectively referred to as the "Annual Financial Statements." The Annual Financial Statements, together with the
HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, are herein collectively referred to as the "Financial Statements"

The HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the European Union ("IAS 34") and the
accounting policies included in the FY 2022 Financial Statements. For further information, see note 2.1 to the HY 2023
Interim Financial Statements.

The FY 2022 Financial Statements and the FY 2021 Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte
Accountants B.V., who issued unqualified opinions as part of the corresponding audit reports for each period. The FY 2022
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the

unqualified opinion, and have been prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP.

Our financial year runs from January 1 to December 31.

The Financial Statements are contained in the F-pages to this Offering Memorandum and should be read in
conjunction with the relevant notes thereto.

**_Presentation of Financial Information_**

We first prepared annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended December
31, 2022. Until December 31, 2021, we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP.
Accordingly, we prepared the FY 2022 Financial Statements in compliance with IFRS as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, together with the comparative period data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. In preparing
the FY 2022 Financial Statements, our opening statement of financial position was prepared as of January 1, 2021, the date
of our transition to IFRS.


-----

As Dutch GAAP differs in significant respects from IFRS, the adoption of IFRS greatly reduces the comparability
of the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared under IFRS with the FY 2021 Financial Statements and FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS." In order to aid in the understanding of_
our financial information on a comparable basis in this Offering Memorandum, we present our historical financial condition
and results of operations as follows (unless otherwise indicated):

    - as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 (and comparative information for the six months ended
June 30, 2022), as derived from the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
IAS 34, the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial statements;

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as derived from the FY 2022 Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS;

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, as derived from the comparative financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared
in accordance with IFRS;

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, as derived from (i) the opening statement of financial
position as of January 1, 2021 included in note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with IFRS and (ii) unaudited management financial information for the year ended December
31, 2020 presented using the principles applied by the Company to restate its Dutch GAAP financial
statements in accordance with IFRS (the "Reconciled Financial Information").

The Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared by management
to aid in the understanding of our financial information on a more comparable basis with our financial information for
subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments to the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP to present the Reconciled Financial Information have been prepared on a basis that our
management believes is consistent in all material respects as the basis on which our consolidated financial information is
prepared in accordance with IFRS. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS." However, the presentation of the Reconciled Financial_
Information is based on certain management assumptions and estimates, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only
and, because of its nature, the Reconciled Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not
represent and may not give a true picture of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited
financial statements in accordance with IFRS for such period. For example, the Reconciled Financial Information has not
retrospectively applied the IFRS requirements for business combinations as of January 1, 2020. The Reconciled Financial
Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial information for subsequent periods and should not be
regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See also "Risk
_Factors—Financial Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not_
_comparable with our prior financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP." For additional information_
and a management reconciliation of the Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the FY
2020 Financial Statements prepared under Dutch GAAP, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS."_

Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences
between Dutch GAAP, IFRS and other generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect
the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments
of, IFRS may have on the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum, our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. You should read this discussion in conjunction with
the sections entitled "Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information," "Risk Factors,"
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Geographic Regions_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we provide certain operational and revenue data for the following geographic
regions based on where revenue is generated:

    - **The Netherlands;**

    - **Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland,**
the Czech Republic and Slovakia;


-----

    - **Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; and**

    - **Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom.**

**_Operating Segments_**

In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8 "Operating
Segments," for the following operating segments based on the geographical regions where revenue is generated:

    - **Central Europe, consisting of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland,**
Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy and the United Kingdom; and

    - **Nordics, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.**

For additional information, see note 5 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements.

**_LTM Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023. This financial data has been calculated by adding (i) the audited consolidated financial information
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and (ii) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the
six months ended June 30, 2023 and then subtracting (iii) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023 has been prepared solely for illustrative purposes for this Offering Memorandum. It is not prepared in the ordinary
course of our financial reporting and has neither been audited nor reviewed. The unaudited financial information for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023 included herein is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023
is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period and should not be used as the basis
for or prediction of an annualized calculation.

**_As Adjusted Consolidated Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information, presented on an as
_adjusted basis, to illustrate the effect the Transactions (as defined herein) would have had on certain of our financial results_
as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 or on our financial position as of June 30, 2023, as applicable.

The unaudited _as adjusted consolidated financial information is for informational purposes only and is not_
intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have
reported had the Transactions been completed as of July 1, 2022, in the case of our as adjusted total debt interest expense
and as adjusted senior secured debt interest expense, or as of June 30, 2023, in the case of our as adjusted cash and cash
equivalents, as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total net debt, as adjusted senior secured debt and as adjusted secured senior
secured net debt. The unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial information should not be taken as indicative of our
future consolidated results of operations or financial position. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future
results following completion of the Transactions. The unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial information has not
been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
"Use of Proceeds," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions), Cash Conversion, Free Cash Flow, Gross Capital
Expenditure, Gross Debt, Net Debt, Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Cash Flow, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,
Reported EBITDA, Reported EBITDA Margin and Reported Free Cash Flow, that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS (the "Non-IFRS Measures"). For reconciliations of the Non-IFRS Measures to the nearest IFRS
measures, see "Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information" and "Management's Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures," "—Free Cash Flow," and "—Net_
_Debt."_


-----

The Non-IFRS Measures are used by our management to assess operating performance, and we believe that they
and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and
financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by
excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS standards or other generally accepted accounting
principles. The Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit from ordinary operations or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The Non-IFRS
Measures include figures derived from the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, the Annual Financial Statements and
accounting records through aggregation, subtraction or division, but the Non-IFRS Measures have neither been audited nor
reviewed. We define these Non-IFRS Measures as follows:

    - **_Adjusted EBITDA_** represents our Reported EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off items described in
"Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As
_Adjusted Financial Information";_

These Non-IFRS Measures may be defined differently from the corresponding terms under the Indenture and have
limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of their limitations are the following:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;


-----

    - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and the relevant Non-IFRS Measures do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required to make such replacements;

    - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, these Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our
obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our audited financial information and by
using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.

**_Net Debt_**

In our FY 2022 Financial Statements, FY 2021 Financial Statements and FY 2020 Financial Statements, we
defined Net Debt as "Gross debt (representing long- and short-term borrowings and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives
and financial guarantee contracts)) less cash and cash equivalents." For the financial year ending December 31, 2023, we
reconsidered our definition of Net Debt and decided to no longer include amortized costs as part of Net Debt. Accordingly,
in this Offering Memorandum, we define Net Debt as "Gross debt (representing long- and short-term borrowings (excluding
amortized costs) and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives and financial guarantee contracts) less cash and cash
equivalents." We believe the revised definition of Net Debt provides investors with more useful information and we intend
to continue to present Net Debt in accordance with this revised definition going forward. We have applied our revised
definition of Net Debt throughout this Offering Memorandum for each of the periods presented, and as a result, the amount
of Net Debt presented herein does not reconcile to the amounts presented in the Annual Financial Statements.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented in
millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in
this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and
amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other information set forth in "Management's
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are calculated using the rounded numerical_
data in the narrative description thereof. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the term "billion" means one thousand
million (1,000,000,000).

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the various markets
or regions in which we operate and compete. The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used
in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from publicly available information and independent industry publications.
In particular, certain information has been derived from the 2022 ERA Equipment Rental Industry Report (the "ERA 2022
**Market Report") and the 2023 June ERA Strategic Report (the “ERA June 2023 Strategic Report”) issued by the**
European Rental Association.

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been
obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of
such information. We believe that these industry publications are reliable, but we have not independently verified any of
the data from third-party sources. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject
to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum.

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding our industry are accurate
or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and speculative and are
not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on
sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of
products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for
different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying
information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data.
Accordingly, the market statistics included in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed with caution and no
representation or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy.

Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and market share and position are not
based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third parties, but are based solely on our own
experience, internal studies, investigation and assessment of market conditions at the time of this Offering Memorandum.
These statements have not been reviewed or verified externally and may differ from estimates made by our competitors or
independent third parties. While we believe that our own market observations are reliable, our estimates and information
derived from them and the market data, statistics and other information included in this Offering Memorandum, may prove
to be inaccurate because of the methods by which we obtained some of the data for these estimates or because this
information cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability of raw data and other factors.
While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding our own estimates presented herein, such estimates involve risks,
assumptions and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the
heading "Risk Factors" in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, such estimates should be viewed with caution and no
representations or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy or
completeness.

-----

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ
materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In
addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which

changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk
factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination
of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given
these risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, you should not place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We urge you to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum
entitled "Presentation of Industry and Market Data," "Summary," "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Industry Overview" and "Business" for a more complete discussion of_
the factors that could affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate.

**Overview**

We are a leading rental equipment specialist in Europe. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental
company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, with strong market positions across our main markets, including the largest
market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden and the second largest market share in each of Germany and
Finland, in each case in terms of revenue in 2022. Our family-owned business started out of four garage boxes in the 1970s,
and, under five decades later, has expanded into an industry leader with an extensive network of 759 depots in 18 European
countries and a fleet of approximately 860,000 rental units as at June 30, 2023. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
we generated €1,524.9 million in revenue and €540.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA.

We serve customers in a variety of end-markets from civil engineering, industrial, construction and infrastructure
to events and warehousing. Our core product offering includes general and specialist rental equipment alongside
complementary products and services, enabling us to be a one-stop-shop for our customer base of both corporate clients
(business-to-business) and individuals including craftsmen and retail clients (business-to-consumer). Our generalist
division is mainly focused on the less cyclical 'fit-out, maintain and operate' market segments which use lighter equipment,
while our specialist division is tailored to reach niche markets, such as site preparation, sanitation and access control.

With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our
customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe,
for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such
as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and
construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and
equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside
the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand
recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from
HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens
and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer "do-it-yourself" ("DIY") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY
retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business
less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further
simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training
courses, project management and emergency assistance.

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions:

    - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the_**
twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland,_**
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our
revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which_**
generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023; and

    - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue_**
(representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

In addition, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8
"Operating Segments" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see "Presentation of
_Financial Information—Operating Segments."_


-----

We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group,
is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our
portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe
since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020.

We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist
rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our
products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and
local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each
depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally
stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our
hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure
allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements.

Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past
decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996,
we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through
international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such
as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we
acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our
geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In
addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality
offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs.

The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the
equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of
ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital
deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity
to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their
targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can
contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also
invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers'
industries.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe our success is attributable to the following competitive strengths which will drive our future growth:

**_Leading market positions in a large and growing European market supported by favorable underlying growth drivers_**

We have grown significantly since our founding in 1977 as a local rental company. Since then, we have grown
into a multinational company through a combination of organic growth and transformative and bolt-on acquisitions. With
the Cramo acquisition in 2020, which allowed us to expand our operations in the Nordics and Baltics while strengthening
our network in Western and Central Europe, we have created a true pan-European rental equipment player with increased
scale and resilience. We believe that our current footprint provides us with beneficial scale in strong and growing
geographic and customer end-markets.

We believe we are the second largest equipment rental business in Europe by rental revenue in 2022. As of June
30, 2023, we operate a comprehensive depot network of 759 depots, comprising 681 general rental depots and 78 specialist
rental depots. We believe that our scale is particularly important as a provider of rental equipment, because it helps us
optimize fleet utilization rates through our ability to easily relocate units to areas with higher demand for specific types of
equipment and provides us with additional bargaining power in negotiations with OEMs and equipment suppliers and
maintenance partners. We believe that our scale and our market leadership also help to increase our brand recognition and
affords us with greater opportunities to attract and retain talented and experienced personnel.

In the Netherlands, which is historically our cornerstone market, we believe that we hold a strong leader position
with between 25% and 30% of market share based on revenue in 2022, which we believe is significantly ahead of our
competitors. We believe we are also the leader in Belgium with approximately 10% of market share and the second-largest
player in Germany with between 5% and 10% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. With the acquisition
of Cramo in 2020, we expanded our presence into five more European markets (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and
Lithuania) and significantly strengthened our position in six European countries where Boels and Cramo had a joint
presence. We believe that we are the second largest player in Sweden, with close to 20% of market share, and in Finland,
with more than 15% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022.


-----

We believe that the markets we address are strong and poised for further growth. According to the ERA 2022
Market Report, the total market size of the top 15 European rental equipment markets is estimated to have increased by 4%
from €24.7 billion in 2021 to €25.7 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow by 3.3% in 2023 and 5.6% in 2024. According
to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the European market is expected to remain strong, driven by an increased rental
penetration and a structural shift in customers' preferences towards renting rather than owning equipment. This shift is
supported by the attractiveness and flexibility offered by renting, as it optimizes the split between operating costs and
capital expenditures by reducing the fixed portion of maintenance and fleet replacement costs and allows customers to
avoid investing in expensive equipment that may not be used frequently. Moreover, the transition to achieving net zero
CO2 emissions amplifies this effect, as electric equipment is generally more expensive. This structural shift is expected to
support continued demand for rental equipment companies' products and services over the medium and long term.

We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from growth and positive trends in the equipment rental industry.
The European rental equipment industry is still highly fragmented, consisting of a large number of small companies serving
local or regional markets, with a limited number of medium to larger companies serving regional, national and international
customers. We believe we are one of only a few companies with a strong pan-European platform, with strong relationships
with the key equipment OEMs. We compete with a large number of smaller competitors locally and a few larger
international competitors. We believe that we are well-positioned for growth by leveraging our scale and footprint, while
relying on our proven approach of customizing our strategy for each local market, while centralizing our key operations.

**_Resilient business model supported by robust diversification across geographies, end markets, products and customers,_**
**_supported by a notable depot network_**

We strive to minimize the impact of economic cycles through continually maximizing our rental fleet utilization
rate, developing specialist activities focused on non-construction related niche markets, diversifying our customer base by
investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction related customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of
construction projects.

We have a diversified footprint and address several different customer end-markets, helping to mitigate our
exposure to macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, with the acquisition of Cramo, we significantly increased our
geographical diversification, bringing our revenue generated in the Netherlands to 24% of our total revenue for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023, compared to nearly half of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Moreover,
no single country represented more than 25% of our revenue generation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We
believe that this enhanced geographic diversification gives us greater resilience during periods of slow economic growth,
as different countries operate within different economic cycles. Based on our revenue and EBITDA growth, we believe we
outperformed our largest European competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving the resilience of our business
model.

The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023.

We address multiple customer end markets, which also contributes to our resilience in reducing the impact of volatility of
external factors such as market conditions and macroeconomic developments. We have positioned ourselves as a leading
generalist equipment rental company that is also active in the attractive specialist sub-segment and in DIY, with specialist
rental and DIY representing 28% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. For the year ended December
31, 2022, approximately 54% of our sales were derived from non-construction end-markets, indicating a relatively modest
exposure to the cyclical construction market. Furthermore, our exposure to the construction end market includes a large
part of less cyclical phases of construction activities, such as the fit out, maintenance and operational phases.

The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by end markets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.


-----

Over time, we have continued developing our expertise in specialist rental equipment, focusing on nonconstruction related end-markets, such as site preparation, modular space, measurement, testing and safety, sanitation,
portable kitchen, hoisting and lifting, access control, and industrial rental and pumps. We believe our specialized knowledge
is key to our ability to service different niche markets, providing further resilience and less exposure to the more cyclical
construction market. By leveraging our generalist rental equipment business, we also aim to provide the best and most
comprehensive rental solutions for our customers with the objective of cross-selling our specialist equipment to fuel future
growth. Ultimately, our specialist business represents a key peer differentiator with customers, which we believe provides
for higher returns.

In parallel, we also operate in the niche market of DIY rental, with more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops as at June
30, 2023, where customers at DIY retail stores have access to primarily smaller equipment rental such as tools. This type
of business is less cyclical than traditional equipment rental market and the costs to operate this business are typically lower
than other equipment rental businesses due to the strong operational leverage of the existing rental depot network. In the
DIY market, we are able to offer convenience as a differentiating factor to our customers, generating higher customer foot
traffic in the stores, at a time when e-commerce is putting a strain on retailers and brick-and-mortar stores.

We strive to offer a wide range of equipment and tools across all the phases of construction projects, including
the build (both heavy construction and fit out), operate and maintain phases. Our business model also hinges on providing
a diversified range of products to our customers. We particularly focus on smaller equipment rentals, such as perforators,
ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, which represented approximately 48% of our
rental revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. These rentals position us within the less-cyclical 'fit out',
'maintain' and 'operate' phases of the asset cycle, as demand for such rentals is typically more resilient and makes us less
dependent on lengthy construction projects. For example, smaller equipment rentals tend to be more sought after for
renovation and maintenance use, which are inherently less exposed to cyclical demand than other end uses. As of June 30,
2023, with a fleet of approximately 860,000 equipment units, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized
equipment, in addition to value-added services such as logistics, we aim to provide full turnkey solutions to strengthen our
customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner.

Furthermore, with a comprehensive network of 759 depots (strategically located within a 50-kilometer reach of
our key customers and project sites across Europe) and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30,
2023, we are capable of mobilizing our rental fleet even in remote places for any customer or user at the right time, through
multiple delivery methods: pick up and return or delivery to desired locations. By constantly adapting our network to
changes and fluctuations in the market, we have the strategic ability to open or close access points near our customers.
Based on market trends or developments in specific regions in Europe, we can adapt swiftly and embrace changes in our
industry.

Our hub-and-spoke networking model provides a diversified customer reach and develops efficiency and
flexibility in our operations, ensuring that we are close to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return
or project delivery. This proximity to our customers results in shorter transport times, lower costs and lower CO2 emissions.

Supported by our broad product offering and dense network, we also benefit from a large and diversified customer
base, serving numerous customers of different sizes and from different sectors through our various channels (both generalist
and specialist rental products) ranging from DIY customers, cash customers and craftsmen to large industrial, services and
construction companies, potentially operating in different economic cycles. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our
top 10 customers accounted for 7.4% of our revenue, with no single customer representing more than 2% of our revenue.
We benefit from strong customer loyalty, evidenced by the fact that our 10 largest customers by revenue have, on average,
an approximately 20-year relationship with us.

**_Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust fleet management and digital_**
**_capabilities_**

We differentiate our offering from most of our peers by focusing on smaller rental items, such as tools and access
equipment, in addition to construction equipment and containers. The chart below shows our revenue breakdown by product
category for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

Over the last five years, we have invested more than €1.4 billion to renew our rental fleet, with €448 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a young, well-invested fleet with a historical purchase value of approximately
€2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023. These investments have reduced the weighted average age of our fleet to 53 months as of
June 30, 2023, allowing us to offer our customers the latest advanced equipment and sufficient headroom to reduce or delay
our capital expenditures during economic downturns.

The chart below shows our rental equipment fleet's average useful life and its age (in months), by product category,
as of June 30, 2023.

Our tools product category, which amounted to 16% of our rental sales for the twelve months ended June 30,
2023, has the lowest spread between average useful life and average fleet age in our fleet, with an average of approximately
3.5 years of use remaining before ultimately needing to be replaced.

Our smaller equipment, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding
equipment, and other small tools, are characterized by superior unit economics compared to our other product categories,
as they lead to higher money utilization rates (defined as our twelve-month fleet sales divided by the historical purchase
price, based on the weighted average price by number of rental units). For the year ended December 31, 2022, our money
utilization rate for the tools and light equipment product category was higher than our larger product categories, such as
construction equipment, which we believe results in an increase in our return on fleet investments and an increase in our
resilience through business cycles, given our high exposure to the tools and light equipment category.

The chart below shows our money utilization rate for our different types of rental equipment for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023.


-----

Our focus on tools and access equipment makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects and more
exposed to the less cyclical renovation market, where we have a better pricing power among our smaller customers. On
our major long-term projects, we often provide a full range of equipment from small hand-held tools to larger equipment,
reflecting our ability to support our clients on their various steps and needs with adequate and available equipment. This
ability to provide full range of equipment in due time ultimately fosters relationships with our clients, creating recurring
revenue streams and the potential for cross-selling between our generalist and specialist equipment.

We have developed a robust asset management strategy for our extensive fleet. Our fleet management strategy
covers the entire lifecycle of our equipment units, which includes purchasing, renting, and equipment servicing, as well as
reselling the equipment at the end of its financial or economic lifetime. When making purchasing decisions, we seek to
provide a true one-stop shop experience for our customers by ensuring a high degree of availability across our entire rental
range and equipment that is adapted to their needs. By closely monitoring trends, events and market prices, we can quickly
adjust and adapt our offer to customers' needs. For example, the share of Eco-labelled equipment in our fleet is relatively
high and growing in line with higher market demand for electrical, hybrid or battery-powered equipment and the highest
sustainability standards. Simultaneously, we seek time- and cost-efficiency to maximize our economies of scale and fleet
occupancy performance. These initiatives improve our fleet availability and utilization rates while minimizing our
maintenance capital expenditures.

We have implemented an advanced and integrated infrastructure to drive decision making for our fleet, such as
enterprise resource planning and specialized hardware and software. This asset management system allows us to track the
complete life cycle of any rental asset in our fleet, providing us with visibility on our any given item (such as depot
performance, inventory levels, fleet allocation and pricing) and the ability to adjust our fleet investment and pricing. This
enables us able to serve our customers according to their needs, quickly and efficiently. In addition, this system makes it
possible to limit downtime and improve utilization rates and pricing. Finally, as a piece of our equipment reaches the end
of its lifecycle within the Company, we believe that we are able to optimize the timing of its resale and maximize its resale
value through closely following secondary market prices and trends and taking third-party insights into account.

Our fleet management strategy also relies on a central procurement strategy. This enables us to benefit from
economies of scale and allows us to be close to our OEMs and their product development, positioning us at the forefront
for the latest products in terms of efficiency, safety and sustainability. In addition, our relationships with OEMs not only
allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of
materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with
our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
We also foster our relationships with our OEMs by collaborating on technological developments and data analyses, and we
aim to deepen our cooperation with them further.

In addition, we have invested and continue to invest in the latest technology to help us efficiently process our fleet
maintenance and repairs and minimize our related costs and administrative workload. These technological capabilities
allow us to be in full control of depreciation and replacement strategies and therefore systematically improve our fleet
usage, composition and performance. We monitor and reduce the impact machine repairs and maintenance have on lifetime
costs and resale value.

Finally, we seek to be a leader in innovation and digital transformation across the entire rental process, which we
believe results in higher customer satisfaction and percentage of recurring business, better fleet damage control and
substantial emissions savings. We were an early adopter of digital offerings in the European rental market, having
anticipated this trend by preparing a detailed mapping of our customer experiences per segment, with the aim to simplify
online rental in all our customer's life cycle stages and provide a one-stop-shop solution: from becoming a customer to
online renting, logistics, usage, having all relevant information available and invoicing. In parallel, this digital
transformation generates operational efficiencies by allowing us to optimize our processes such as transport and logistics.

**_Strong financial and operational track record supported by counter-cyclical cash generation through capital_**
**_expenditure flexibility and proven M&A integration capabilities_**

Our financial performance has been driven by a strategic combination of strong organic growth and the successful
integration of both transformative and smaller bolt-on acquisitions, which have expanded our geographical reach and
product offering. Since our foundation more than 45 years ago, we have been focused on increasing scale and achieving
sales growth. Our business model is based on actively distributing our fleet through our depot network, directly competing
with local players and ultimately winning market share by providing newer equipment and better customer service. This
model has delivered a proven track record of strong growth over the past decade. Between 2012 and 2022, our revenue
grew at a CAGR of approximately 19%, significantly exceeding the growth of the economy, the construction market and
the equipment rental market over the same period in Europe.

While delivering robust sales growth, we have also managed to retain steady and high margins, with an Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 35% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. By being highly focused on maintaining a high portion
of variable costs, we have managed to retain our profitability during economic downturns.

The following chart shows our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth from the year ended 2012 through the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

**Long-term financial track record (€ millions and %)**

**____**
Notes: Figures between 2012 and 2019 reflect our reported results prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and are not comparable with
subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. Figures provided for 2020 reflect the Reconciled Financial Information together with
certain pro forma adjustments to reflect the acquisition of Cramo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. Figures provided for 2021, 2022 and

any accounting or pro forma adjustments that may be required to present consolidated financial information and is presented for illustrative
purposes only. The information and adjustments presented are based upon available information, management estimates and assumptions that
are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and change. See "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—We present information relating to Adjusted
_EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this_
_information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them."_
(1) For comparability purposes, revenue growth between 2019 and 2020 is expressed as 2020 revenue pro forma to reflect the acquisition
of Cramo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, compared to 2019 revenue pro forma to reflect the acquisition of Cramo as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2019, each prepared under Dutch GAAP. Revenue for 2019 has been prepared solely for illustrative purposes
based on management estimates utilizing a simple aggregation of the revenue of Cramo and our revenue for the year ended December
31, 2019.

We have the ability to actively manage our fleet investment based on existing market conditions and the stage of
the industry cycle, which has contributed to our counter-cyclical cash generation. In an industry growth cycle, we invest in
our rental fleet to enhance our product catalogue and expand into new products and markets. In a downturn, with our newly
invested young fleet, we can rapidly reduce our capital expenditures and postpone our investments, streamline our depot
network and the size of the fleet, and pay down debt with our strong cash flows resulting from lower capital expenditures.
Our business has flexibility to make investment decisions on a regular, short-term basis, and has no long-term expansionary
capital expenditures commitments. Therefore, we are generally able to quickly adjust our fleet investments to respond to
the changing market environment. For example, recently, we were able to quickly adapt our investments in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on maintaining our existing fleet through reduced capital expenditures. After the
stabilization of market conditions in 2021, we resumed our investments by increasing our capital expenditures.


-----

The countercyclical nature of cash generation and our ability to adjust our capital expenditure while preserving
our cash generation through the cycles supports our conservative leverage policy and enables us to deleverage during
challenging economic periods, as we did during the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, the double dip recession,
and more recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy that we pursue either for geographical expansion
(filling in gaps in our existing footprint), increase market share, acquire specialist knowledge, improve our competitive
position, or acquire certain assets. We have a clear, defined and well-established acquisitions strategy with a dedicated
integration team in place.

The success of our international expansion and our ability to effectively integrate acquired companies is
demonstrated by our track record of 27 successful acquisitions since 2012. In particular, we demonstrated our disciplined
M&A strategy and execution with our transformative acquisition of Cramo in 2020. During the 6 months of the initial
integration period, our management executed a clear integration plan to minimize execution risk related to the acquisition,
while maintaining a high quality service for our customers and efficiently responding to their needs. In countries where
Boels and Cramo had geographic overlap, such as in Germany, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, we focused
our efforts on optimizing our depot network, rebranding and refurbishing Cramo's depots in Central Europe (including
Germany), enhancing our cross-selling opportunities and optimizing our back-office functions. We also invested
substantially in integrating the fleets in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, increasing the availability of fleet and our
flexibility, allowing us to optimize our response to market demands. In 2021 and 2022, we invested in and deployed new
equipment categories that meet specific local requirements as a result of our analyses of the local markets, in order to be
less dependent on large projects, with the aim to reach small and medium enterprises and retail clients.

As a result of such efforts, we were able to successfully integrate our Central European operations in only 10
months and achieved synergies in terms of centralization of our mutual best practices in our key operations: IT, finance,
fleet management and human resources through the deployment of our One Boels strategy. As a result of these efforts, we
believe we have realized significant synergies, which generate recurring savings in EBITDA and capital expenditures,


-----

primarily due to the optimization of our procurement functions, the consolidation of our IT systems and the reduction of
our corporate expenses (including as a result of the closing of Cramo's headquarters in Finland).

We believe that our acquisition track record, including our ability to integrate companies, positions us for growth
while strengthening our local presence. The success of our international expansion supports our financial and operational
development and establishes us as a market consolidator in a fragmented equipment rental industry. For further details
about certain of our recent acquisitions, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions, Geographic Expansion and Depot Openings."_

**_Strong senior and local management teams with extensive industry experience_**

We have a strong management team with extensive experience in the equipment rental industry and a track record
of operational excellence, led by one of the most recognized and distinguished people in the industry, Pierre Boels Jr., our
Chief Executive Officer since 1996 and President of the ERA between 2016 and 2022. The members of our management
are further supported by divisional and regional managers in an organizational structure that empowers entrepreneurship
spirit and decision making. Jan Piet Valk, our Chief Financial Officer since 2020 and member of our Management Board,
has acquired a proven international experience through his previous chief financial officer positions. He is responsible for
the overall financial management, M&A strategy, health and safety policy, legal, treasury, sustainability and real estate
matters and is involved in all key decisions in the company. Mr. Valk has recently been awarded "CFO of the Year" by
Financieel Management, in recognition of his independent role in the leadership of our Group, his management skills and
his board position.

Under Mr. Pierre Boels Jr.'s leadership, we managed to significantly increase our sales and EBITDA, both
organically and through acquisitions, having successfully executed and integrated 27 acquisitions since 2012. Our CEO
has assembled an experienced management team with significant industry expertise, including:

    - Reiant Mulder, Chief Operations Officer of Central Europe and member of our Strategic Board with
more than 20 years of services experience.

    - Guy Cremer, Chief Procurement Officer, working with us since 1989 and leading in the Fleet
Management department since 2000. Additionally, Mr. Cremer was recognized with the award for
"Rental person of the year" by ERA in June 2023 for his influential role in the shift towards lower carbon
emission equipment last year; and

    - Martin Holmgren: Chief Operations Officer of Nordics and a member of our Strategic Board. Mr.
Holmgren is also Vice President of ERA and has worked for almost 30 years in the construction and
rental industry.

Our highly qualified senior management team is in close contact with our local business directors, since
investment decisions strongly benefit from local market knowledge. For example, the choice between opening a greenfield
location when expanding into a new region or acquiring an established company in the region is based on local insights
about rental company concentration provided by local business leaders: we consider acquisitions when rental concentration
is high and greenfield expansion in locations where rental concentration is low.

We have an external Advisory Board that meets five times a year and consists of a group of experienced
entrepreneurs and leaders. This independent body advises the Management Board on policy matters and the general course
of affairs of the Group. In addition, the Advisory Board and its individual members function as a critical sounding board
for our Management Board. We are in the process of implementing a two-tier board system by the end of 2025 and have
started the search for a Supervisory Board, which will supervise the general course of affairs in the company and the
businesses affiliated with the company. It will also supervise the functioning of the Management Board as such and the
policy conducted and will provide the Management Board with advice. For further discussion on our management team,
see "Management."

**_Ambitious CSR targets to lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental industry and mitigate environmental_**
**_impact throughout the value chain_**

We strive to lead our company with high business ethics and lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental
industry. We have set ambitious CSR targets to position ourselves as a front runner in the development of a safe and
environmentally friendly business and a key partner to our customers in meeting their increasing needs and demands for
more sustainable solutions.

We believe that the core purpose of rental, compared to ownership, is the achievement of the efficient use of
equipment and materials, therefore making a positive contribution to the circular economy. According to a research study


-----

led by ERA, efficient use of equipment results in a reduction of approximately 30% to 50% of CO2 emissions (depending
on specific user practice) and that the rental business model stimulates such efficient use. Our rental concept allows our
customers and their end-customers to meet their objectives and targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality, safety and to
reduce their carbon footprint.

CSR topics are at the heart of our business model. We also chose to apply the Global Reporting Initiative 2021
("GRI 2021") Standards and Disclosures to report our sustainability-related data, to commit to the guidelines of UN Global
Compact and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals relevant to our business. In addition, based on a formal
materiality assessment, we have identified four focus areas covering all aspects of corporate and social responsibility,
including Employee Care, Social Care, Customer Care and Environmental Care. We have also identified, key performance
indicators in relation to each topic and set ambitious targets for 2025.

We aim to be the leader in sustainable fleet investments, to enable our customers in executing their projects with
the lowest level of emissions, while continuing to deliver profitable growth. Our Green Team, which includes members
from our fleet, sales and marketing departments, has jointly set out a strategy to invest in anticipation of customer needs
and develop ambitious and innovative solutions (including zero emission equipment) in their field. For our fleet, we invest
in energy-efficient products to improve our energy performance. For example, our fleet includes electrical two-ton
excavators, fully battery-operated six-meter telehandlers and over two-ton electric-wheeled loaders. We also have a wide
availability of battery packs and have created solar panel roofs for site huts and new zero emission welfare units, which
were both brought to market in 2022. Additionally, our fleet contains more than 1,000 Stage V engines meeting the EU
standard for non-road machines with low emissions of particulate matter.

Our state-of-the-art fleet adheres to strict environmental and safety performance standards and helps increase our
customers' productivity while reducing their emissions footprint. Of our total energy powered fleet units (equipment driven
by a motor and with all types of power), approximately 81% is electrically-powered as of December 31, 2022 and we aim
to increase this percentage to 85% by 2025. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 67% of our fleet value was comprised of
electric, hybrid and gas equipment and not motorized equipment (meaning, equipment without an engine or motor). We
have steadily reduced the portion of our diesel-powered equipment as a percentage of fleet value over time, reaching 24%
as of June 30, 2023 (excluding Stage V diesel powered equipment). A breakdown of our fleet value by type of power as of
June 30, 2023, is presented below.

**Our fleet value as of June 30, 2023 (in € billion)**

Furthermore, during 2022, we have made significant progress in offering resource-efficient and sustainable
alternatives to customers, supporting them to minimize climate impact:

    - We increased the share of units powered by electricity within our energy-powered fleet.

    - We increased the share of Eco-labelled fleet.

    - We invested over 1.63% of our total fleet value in high-tech, zero-emission machines, with a target to
reach 4.7% by 2025.

We also continuously work to mitigate our own climate impact by reducing energy consumption, increasing the
use of renewable energy and increasing circularity of our products and operations. We reduce, reuse or recycle materials,
reduce waste and handle hazardous waste properly. For facilities and installations, we invest in energy efficient products,
services and design for energy performance improvement. For example, we have been increasing our energy efficiency
while reducing our emissions through investments in sustainable technologies and services, LED lighting, solar panels,


-----

better insulation or development of energy management systems. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our
energy use relative to sales by 12%, compared to 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our gas usage
by 28% to 8,900 MWh compared to 2021, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,670 tCO2 of our emissions.
We are also improving logistics planning in order to limit emissions related to equipment deliveries, as well as increasing
our purchase of more renewable energy.

We also disclose the Group's greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect
emissions) with clear reduction targets. In 2022, we announced a number of targets with respect to our carbon emissions
for 2025, using 2021 as a baseline, including:

    - reduce our emissions (calculated in tCO2) relative to sales (Scope 1 and 2) by 20%;

    - reduce our energy use relative to sales (Scope 1 (direct energy use) and Scope 2 (purchased energy)) by
15%; and

    - increase our share of renewable electricity to above 92% (compared to 56% in 2022 and 49% in 2021).

Simultaneously, we are assessing our scope 3 targets with the main initiatives expected to be set as soon as 2024.
For a further discussion of our commitment to environmental and social governance matters and our targets for 2025, see
"Business—Environmental, Social and Governance."

**Our Strategies**

Our business strategy focuses on profitable growth, further enhancing operational efficiency, strengthening our
market position in all segments, expanding our service offerings, developing innovative digital solutions to improve
customer efficiency and promoting corporate social responsibility.

**_Achieve a leading position in all our markets and become a leading partner for our customers_**

We intend to continue working to provide a high quality, one-stop-shop experience for both individual consumers
and businesses, while ensuring that our entire rental range of products meets our customers' evolving demands, in order to
achieve a leading market position in each of the markets we address.

We believe that we are well-positioned to become the leading partner of our customers in all the geographies we
serve. We believe that our customers already recognize us as a preferred one-stop-shop for their rental needs, primarily due
to our diversification across products, end markets, general and specialist rental, and our strong European geographic
coverage. Our acquisition of Cramo has demonstrated our ambition to keep strengthening and expanding our geographic
coverage and diversifying our service offering.

We believe we can achieve a leading position in our markets through our strong, long-term partnerships with our
customers. In order to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner, we aim to
provide full turn-key solutions, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment (including site huts,
site safes, traffic sets and sanitation), in addition to value-added services such as logistics. For example, in 2021, we
delivered full service rental solutions for a wind farm project in Lithuania by providing site huts, construction equipment
and special tools, in addition to access control, on-site maintenance, and helping with planning, transportation, delivery.
Since 2022, we provide full turnkey solutions for an automotive Gigafactory located in Berlin-Brandenburg. We combine
our proximity to customers and our understanding of their needs in order to continue providing our customers with valueadded services and products. Finally, we intend to continue pursuing our fleet investment strategy, which aims to maintain
a complete range of sustainable and safe rental equipment.

**_Grow through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions_**

We have achieved an impressive track record of both sales and EBITDA growth through a strategic combination
of strong organic growth and the successful integration of both our transformative and smaller bolt-on acquisitions.
Through our acquisition strategy in particular, we have expanded to cover new geographic markets and have diversified
our catalogue of products and services.

We believe we have significant opportunities to continue growing organically due to our comprehensive network
of 759 depots and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30, 2023. We intend to increase the density
of our network in less concentrated regions which we believe have a strong potential of profitable growth through our clear
greenfield expansion strategy.


-----

We also intend to continue evaluating strategic acquisition targets to further strengthen and expand our operations
and customer base, to selectively enter new markets over time, in particular in geographic areas with low rental company
concentration to increase opportunities for upselling and cross-selling our products. In pursuing such acquisitions, we
maintain the same disciplined, targeted, and opportunistic acquisition investment criteria that have historically enabled us
to successfully identify acquisition targets and profitably acquire and integrate them.

Successful integration of acquisitions is key to our strategy, and we believe we are well-positioned to integrate
future acquisitions efficiently and profitably. We have dedicated integration teams supported by local teams with superior
knowledge of their local markets to develop synergies in our fleet management, expedite the completion and integration of
acquisitions and position us to achieve our long-term success.

**_Drive digital innovation to increase productivity for our customers and improve our operational efficiency_**

We have developed and intend to continue to develop digital services in order to improve our customers'
experience and boost our operational performance.

We believe that we are a leader in the development of new, innovative digital business models in our industry.
We have developed and deployed new types of data- and connectivity-based solutions to connect our people, internal
processes and fleet to our customers, such as our new smart application for mobile devices, "Equipment Pool", which
improves customers' access to equipment and machines, while reducing transportation times to and from customers'
construction sites . We believe that we can leverage our digital processes and use of data in a customer-focused manner in
order to improve communication between our employees and our customers, better identify customers' needs and facilitate
interactions and transactions with customers.

Although we already have improved processes and digital tools in place to optimize our customers' experience,
we intend to continue enhancing our rental websites, including those of Cramo, Boels Rental and IQ Pass, to add further
equipment data and specifications and combine our general and specialist rental fleet in a single platform. We believe that
such technological capabilities positions us to achieve the full potential of our one-stop-shop solutions.

We also intend to continue leveraging digital tools to streamline and boost efficiency in our internal systems. For
example, we have implemented a single group-wide financial system to monitor our cash flows and key performance
indicators. We have also implemented our group-wide One Boels strategy in order to continue harmonizing systems and
processes based on four pillars: (i) One IT approach; (ii) One financial organization, (iii) One fleet and procurement
organization and (iv) One HR approach and organization. We have developed our One Boels strategy as a clear, distinct,
and strong organization that focuses not only on our customers' needs, but also boosts our efficiency. We intend to continue
enhancing our operational systems and processes to increase our operational and procurement efficiency, improve our
strategic relationships with OEMs, strengthen our fleet management and negotiating position for strategic procurement and
maintenance of our fleet, and enhance our employee retention.

**_Maintain top-tier performance as a leading rental company_**

We aim to maintain our operational performance by systematically improving and optimizing fleet usage,
composition and performance. Historically, we have had a more centralized business model where our rental fleet was
managed centrally to optimize the allocation of equipment, while local managers organized by countries and depots offered
knowledge of local markets. Cramo, on the other side, has historically had a more decentralized business group structure,
where operating decisions were made at the country and business-unit level. With the integration of Cramo, we have
developed a synergized approach, which aims to combine the best practices of both organizations by centralizing key
operations such as procurement or fleet management, while we keep a flexible and locally oriented commercial approach
for each market and geography.

We believe that this approach, together with our close cooperation with, and monitoring of, our depots, business
units and departments, positions us to achieve our strategy, whilst retaining our disciplined and flexible business and
financial models.

**_Reinforce our commitments to the environment, safety, quality and corporate responsibility_**

We are committed to promoting and maintaining corporate sustainability and responsibility as a core component
of our business. We intend to continue being a leading climate- and resource-efficient rental company, paving the way to
enhance sustainability in the rental industry and to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our value chain. We
believe that our value chain perspective on sustainability helps us identify how we can optimally manage our impact on
the environment while efficiently operating our business. We also strive to meet our customers' increasing needs and
demands for more sustainable solutions.


-----

We are convinced that maintaining an adequate corporate governance policy is a prerequisite to structure the
organization efficiently and effectively and achieve our strategic goals. We also believe that our sustainability policy helps
us to manage risks and to consider the interests of all our stakeholders, including our shareholders, our employees and our
customers. We discuss our material sustainability topics, focus areas and strategic targets twice a year with our Strategic
Board and our Operations Board, and periodically with the Sustainability Steering Committee that we have implemented
to help us achieve our sustainability goals. For a further discussion of our commitment to environmental, social and
governance matters and our targets for 2025, see "Business—Environmental, Social and Governance."

**The Transactions**

On the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering to: (i) repay and cancel a portion of the Existing Term
Loan B in a principal amount equal to €200.0 million, (ii) repay in full amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, (iii) fund cash on our balance sheet for general corporate purposes and (iv) pay fees and expenses in connection
with the Transactions. See "—The Transactions" and "Use of Proceeds." For descriptions of our current and anticipated
indebtedness following the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, see "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements" and "Capitalization."_

The Offering and the application of the proceeds from the Offering as set forth under "Use of Proceeds," are
collectively referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the "Transactions." See also "Use of Proceeds," "Capitalization,"
"Description of the Notes" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."

**Recent Developments**

**_Upsize of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility_**

In connection with the Offering, we expect to increase the lender commitments in respect of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility by €35.0 million to be provided by certain affiliates of J.P. Morgan SE. There can be no assurance
that such increase to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be effected or as to the timing, amount or terms thereof.

**_New EIB Facility_**

We are currently in discussions with the European Investment Bank to obtain an amortizing term loan to support
our further investments in 'green' electric equipment in line with the European Investment Bank's commitment to climate
action and environmental sustainability. The financing is expected to rank pari passu in right of payment and security with
the Notes and the Existing Senior Facilities and only have a minimal impact on our leverage. We will endeavor to close
this transaction by the first half of 2024, although no assurances can be made that the financing will be obtained or as to
the timing, amount or terms thereof.

Netherlands. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent, which in turn is wholly owned by our CEO, Mr. Pierre Boels Jr., and
his family members. See "Shareholders and Related Party Transactions."
(2) The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer's existing and future

Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by property or assets that
do not also secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets securing such other obligations. The Notes will be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future obligations (including trade payables) of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not provide Guarantees. On or

limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. For more information on potential limitations
to the security interests, see "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations." The security interests over the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. The Collateral also secures the Existing_
Senior Facilities on a pari passu basis with the Notes. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement."
(3) The Existing Senior Facilities consist of a €1,450.0 million Existing Term Loan B and a €179.3 million Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The
Existing Senior Facilities are guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities that will guarantee the Notes and secured by the Collateral pari
_passu with the Notes. As of June 30, 2023, €131.6 million was drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. On the Issue Date, a portion_
of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to (a) repay and cancel a portion of the Existing Term Loan B in a principal amount equal to €200.0
million and (b) repay in full amounts drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement." In addition, the Group has access to an overdraft facility of approximately €20.0 million._
As of June 30, 2023, the overdraft facility was drawn for €2.9 million.

Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by property or assets
that do not also secure the Guarantees, to the extent of the value of such property or assets securing such obligations and will be effectively
subordinated to all of the existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by property or assets that do not also secure its
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such obligations. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the

_first prepared annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2022._

**Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As Adjusted Financial Information**

The following tables contain Non-IFRS Measures which are used by our management to assess operating
performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a
company's operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of
financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS
standards or other generally accepted accounting principles. The Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit from ordinary
operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as alternatives to cash flow from
operating, investing or financing activities and have neither been audited nor reviewed. See "Presentation of Financial
_Information—Non-IFRS Measures" for additional information._

__________

(i) In 2020, this primarily represents the additional restructuring expenses as a result of our cost reduction plan following the onset of the COVID19 pandemic amounting to €7.5 million, additional costs to settle the Cramo stock option plan and termination fees amounting to €3.6 million
and Cramo Central Europe integration expenses. In 2021, this primarily represents an additional donation to the jubilee provision and a decrease
in discount rate impact amounting to €2.2 million and additional charges as a result of the establishment of the shared service center in the Nordic
countries amounting to €0.9 million. In 2022, this primarily reflects the release of discounted provisions for employee benefits due to an increased
discount rate amounting to €(2.4) million and release of bonus accruals amounting to €(0.5) million, which was partially offset by certain
severance costs paid to employees connected to the acquisition of Eekels Pompen amounting to €0.2 million. In the six months ended June 30,
2023, this primarily represents the payment of additional performance-related bonuses related to the fourth quarter of 2022 amounting to €0.5
million.
(ii) In 2020, this primarily represents advisory fees paid related to the Cramo acquisition amounting to €6.8 million and advisory fees in relation to
the integration of Cramo Central Europe in Boels amounting to €0.8 million. In 2021, this primarily relates to a provision for a legal claim in
Arlon (Belgium) amounting to €1.6 million and additional expenses relating to a property tax claim in Germany amounting to €1.4 million. In
2022, this primarily represents the release of accruals for invoices from prior years amounting to €(1.8) million, the release of over payments to
debtors amounting to €(0.8) million and insurance compensation related to a depot destroyed by flooding in 2021 amounting to €(0.2) million.
In the six months ended June 30, 2023, this primarily represents the release of an accrual amounting to €(4.0) million and old accounts receivable
balances in connection with our trade receivable financing amounting to €(1.9) million.
(iii) In 2020, this primarily represents insurance compensation related to the destruction of a property in Germany, partially offset by the book value
of such property, amounting to €(0.7) million, a book gain on a sold property in the Netherlands amounting to €(0.4) million and a release of a
provision taken in prior years amounting to €(0.2) million. In 2021, this primarily represents the result of a sale and leaseback transaction in
Belgium amounting to €(0.7) million and a release of accruals amounting to €(0.3) million, offset by additional Cramo Central Europe integration
expenses amounting to €1.2 million and additional provisions related to integration risks of certain acquisitions amounting to €0.6 million. In
the six months ended June 30, 2023, this primarily represents the book gain on a sale and lease back transaction in Germany amounting to €(0.9)
million.
(iv) Represents the movement in the provision for doubtful debtors, which we have considered exceptional since the transition to IFRS in the year
ended December 31, 2022.
(v) Our audited consolidated financial statements and the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 reflect the results of Cramo for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 only. For the month ended January
31, 2020, Cramo's estimated revenue and estimated Reported EBITDA was €44.4 million and €13.4 million, respectively. See "Management's
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—_
_Acquisition of Cramo" for additional information. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had such acquisition_
occurred as at January 1, 2020. See "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before investing in the Notes, you should consider carefully the_
_following risk factors and all information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Additional risks and uncertainties of_
_which we are not aware or that we believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition,_
_liquidity, results of operations or prospects. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results_
_of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected, the Issuer may not be able to pay interest or principal_
_on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See_
_"Forward-Looking Statements" Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks related to our Industry**

**_We are vulnerable to fluctuations and deteriorations in the economic conditions in the industries and markets in which_**
**_we and our customers operate._**

We may be negatively impacted by economic downturns and uncertainty in any of the countries in which we
operate or the global markets generally, as adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial activity, cause disruption
and volatility and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. The demand for our products and services is dependent on,
among other factors, the industries in which our customers operate, the general economy and the stability of the global
credit markets. During economic downturns, certain of our customers may, for example, suspend or delay projects and
events or become more likely to go out of business or default on their payment obligations towards us. We serve a large
number of customers, with a significant portion of our business being derived from construction, infrastructure, civil
engineering and industrial activities. Many of the industries we serve are cyclical and seasonal by nature, with activity
levels that tend to increase during periods of economic growth, decline during economic downturns and vary from quarter
to quarter. Consequently, a downturn in construction, infrastructure, civil engineering or industrial activities, or the
economy as a whole, generally leads to decreased demand for our equipment. Downturns also intensify price competition
as equipment rental providers seek to increase utilization of idle equipment, and inflation can result in increased operating
expenses that we may not be able to fully pass onto our customers. For example, for the six months ended June 30, 2023,
our employee benefits expenses outstripped our revenue growth, in part because we were unable to fully pass along the
cost increases to our customers at the same rate as our costs increased. In particular, some of our operating expenses, such
as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges in specific
countries, are linked to indices, including the Consumer Price Index, which may increase due to inflation. Furthermore,
any extended period of inflation may lead to a stagflation or recession, which could in turn lead to the postponement of
construction, infrastructure, civil engineering and other industrial activities, thereby lowering the demand for our services.
See "—A regional or global health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business and
_exacerbate other risks to which our business is exposed."_

We operate across four geographic regions: the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe, and Other
Countries. In the last twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated 23.8%, 35.3%, 37.8% and 3.0% of our total revenue
in the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe and Other Countries regions, respectively. Within these regions, we
are particularly exposed to the economic conditions in the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. Our end markets may be
impacted, either temporarily or over the long-term, by changes in:

    - government infrastructure spending;

    - spending levels by either public or private customers;

    - the credit markets and other economic conditions affecting our customers' ability to undertake new
projects or hold events, or otherwise impacting customers' demand for our products and services;

    - the cost of construction and other materials; or

    - weather conditions affecting a particular region.

Changes in these or other factors caused by deterioration in the construction, infrastructure, civil engineering and
other industrial sectors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and
cash flows in the future. If in any of our markets the economic conditions deteriorate or a return to economic growth is
further delayed, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.


-----

**_The equipment rental industry is highly competitive, which puts downward pressure on prices._**

The equipment rental industry is highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by
numerous competitors, ranging from national, multi-regional and international equipment rental companies to small,
independent businesses with a limited number of locations. In addition, we may encounter increased competition from
existing competitors or new market entrants in the future.

We face competition principally from pan-European and national rental companies, as well as from regional and
local entities. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our
competitors may be more specialized or may have greater name recognition in some markets. We also face competition
from smaller competitors operating at regional or local levels, many of which benefit from a strong market presence and
local relationships. Over time, our competitors, whether pan-European, national, regional or local, could consolidate their
businesses, and the diversified service offerings or increased synergies of these consolidated businesses could increase
competition in the markets in which we operate. Competition is based on an array of different factors, some of which are
interrelated, including: speed of integrating new or emerging technologies; technical specifications and condition of
equipment; engineering solutions and technical know-how; range and timeliness of the products and services offered;
availability of equipment; client relationships; ability to quickly adapt to client requirements; a track record of delivery;
the willingness to accept higher contractual risks in tender contracts; price; compliance with health and safety and
environmental standards; brand name and reputation; resources and budget available for marketing and sales of products
and services; and relevant certifications. If we are unable to maintain our competitiveness in relation to one or more of
these factors, we may not be able to grow our market share and may potentially lose existing client relationships, which
would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the equipment rental market is increasingly becoming digitized and there is increased focus on the
sustainability of equipment, factors which are beginning to be used as differentiators within the market and are central to
our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to capitalize on such trends or achieve the expected
benefits of this strategy, or that we will be able to successfully implement and maintain the necessary technologies,
processes, and capabilities. Our digitalization strategy involves significant investments in our websites, enterprise resource
planning ("ERP") tools, asset monitoring and maintenance systems, online platforms and data systems, many of which are
provided by third-party service providers and partners. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful, will
generate the anticipated benefits and will not increase our exposure to other risks related to increasing reliance on
information technology systems and third-party service providers. See "—Risks related to our Business—Disruptions in
_our information technology systems could limit our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations" and "—_
_Risks related to our Business—Our business and reputation may be adversely affected by the actions of third parties."_
Furthermore, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in growing our fleet of electrical, hybrid or batterypowered equipment. These investments can be costly and may become obsolete or ineffective due to changing customer
preferences, market conditions, technological developments or other factors.

Our customers might choose to use the services of our competitors rather than ours. Although our top 10 customers
at Group level only represented approximately 7.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, our results
would be negatively affected if we were to lose one or more of our key customers to our competitors or if such customers
were to decrease their business with us for any reason. These or other changes to the competitive landscape of our industry
could result in a loss of market share, decreased revenue and a decline in profitability.

From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete effectively by lowering rental rates or prices.
To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins
could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our operating expenses, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which
are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges in specific countries, are linked to indices, including
consumer price indices, which may increase due to inflation. As such, price pressure can be particularly acute in an
inflationary macroeconomic environment where we endeavor to offset increased operating costs, including the cost of
purchasing equipment, by increasing the rental rates and prices that we charge our customers, and we may not always be
able to sufficiently raise rates or prices to offset the impact of inflation on our costs. In addition, we may not be able to
match a competitor's price reductions or fleet investment, which could cause our customers to reduce their level of business
with us. Termination of contractual arrangements by our customers may result in decreased market share and revenue,
either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Future technological developments may render our current rental fleet technologically obsolete before the end of the_**
**_initially estimated economic life._**

While technological development in the types of tools and equipment that we have traditionally focused our
business on has been relatively slow as compared with other sectors that are characterized by more rapid technological
change, our rental fleet is increasingly technologically advanced and dependent on complex systems and hardware


-----

(including batteries) for their continued operation. Rapid technological evolution and disruptive technologies, failure to
upgrade equipment with new technology in time and related changes in laws and regulations (for example, through
governments requiring the use of lower emissions technology or by customers actively selecting more sustainable options),
may render components of our rental fleet technologically obsolete or redundant prior to the end of their planned useful
rental life. Although we seek to sell such redundant or obsolete products on the secondary market, a secondary market for
such products may not exist or may be insufficient for our resale needs, which would adversely affect the prices at which
we are able to sell and could require us to recognize impairments. Technical obsolescence and redundancy may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_A regional or global health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business and_**
**_exacerbate other risks to which our business is exposed._**

Public health crises, epidemics or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business. For example,
governments around the world, including in most countries where we operate our activities, imposed restrictive measures
to battle the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19, including travel restrictions, curfews, lockdowns, quarantines
and shutdowns of businesses and workplaces. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our business operations were
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results differed by country and by end market depending on the severity
of the government restrictions imposed and the severity of the pandemic. For example, the suspension of large gatherings
and events caused demand for our products and services from the events end market to sharply contract. Overall, we
estimate that, on a like-for-like basis reflecting the acquisition of Cramo in 2020, we experienced a mid-single digit revenue
decline in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our level
of activity, in line with the decrease in market activity, was the sharpest in Italy, Austria, Belgium and the United Kingdom,
where strict lockdown measures were imposed. There can be no assurance that a similar public health crisis will not occur
again in the future on a global or regional basis and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks related to our Business**

**_Our international operations expose us to risks inherent to international business, any of which could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We have operations in 18 countries across Europe. As a result, we are subject to numerous, rapidly evolving and
complex laws and regulations which govern, among other things, labor matters, immigration, health and safety, financial
reporting standards, corporate governance, tax, trade regulations, export controls, and competitive practices in each
jurisdiction where we conduct our business. In addition, changes in regulations could impact the ability of rental operators
to utilize their equipment in certain types of projects, affecting the competitive landscape in those projects, as well as in
other areas in which the non-conforming equipment may be redeployed. Furthermore, we need to comply with various
local standards and practices of different regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies specific to each jurisdiction in
which we operate.

Further, we are also reliant on local managers to oversee the day-to-day functioning of our branches and to ensure
their compliance with local law, and we may be subject to risks related to such compliance, including issues that may arise
as a result of insufficient oversight. In such cases, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

There are multiple risks associated with the international nature of our operations, including inconsistent
regulations across jurisdictions, unanticipated changes in the regulatory environment, political instability (such as the threat
of war, terrorist attacks or civil unrest) and import and export restrictions. Furthermore, these risks may be greater in certain
areas where we operate. Any of these events may affect our employees, reputation, business or financial results as well as
our ability to achieve our strategy, including the following specific business risks:

    - adverse economic developments in economies around the world;

    - social and political instability in a number of countries around the world (such as the Russian invasion
of Ukraine);

    - potential terrorist attacks;

    - epidemics and pandemics, which may adversely affect our workforce, suppliers and customers;

    - adverse changes in governmental policies, especially those affecting trade and investment and any
regulations impacting the equipment rental business or commercial operations generally;


-----

    - differing local product preferences and requirements;

    - pressures on management time and attention due to the complexities of overseeing multinational
operations;

    - challenges in maintaining, staffing, managing multinational operations;

    - differing tax and regulatory regimes;

    - differing labor laws and collective bargaining regimes;

    - enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions;

    - the foreign currency translation and transaction risks of operating in euro;

    - the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend will not perform as expected;

    - obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;

    - reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries;

    - compliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory and regulations relating to potential future
acquisitions;

    - price controls;

    - ownership regulations; and

    - inflation, recession, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, burdensome fiscal
policies and transfer restrictions.

For example, on February 24, 2022, Russian military forces commenced a war against Ukraine, and conflict and
disruption in the region is likely to continue. Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in
Ukraine are highly unpredictable, this conflict has led and could continue to lead to significant market and other disruptions,
including significant volatility in commodity prices and the supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets,
supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyber-attacks.

We have historically had indirect operations in Russia through Fortrent LLC ("Fortrent"), a 50%-owned joint
venture with Ramirent Oyj, and which generated a gain of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was
accounted for in our consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Considering the level of uncertainty due
to the geopolitical situation resulting from the war in Ukraine and the high volatility of the Russian ruble, we fully impaired
our investment in Fortrent in the year ended December 31, 2022, which included the write-down of the full amount of the
carrying value of our investment in Fortrent amounting to €10.9 million, the depreciation of certain receivables amounting
to €0.9 million and the reversal of the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €2.6 million for the period. In the six
months ended June 30, 2023, we reversed the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €1.1 million for the period. In
June 2022, we, together with our joint venture partner, decided to sell Fortrent. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
our interest in Fortrent continues to be held for sale. See also "—Risks related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment—
_Our business is subject to various legal and regulatory compliance risks, including those involving antitrust, anti-money_
_laundering, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations and sanctions."_

We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on our business. The
extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could
potentially have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Although we
do not have any current activities in Russia or Ukraine, we have activities in Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic States, and
if the conflict intensifies or expands beyond Ukraine, it could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, we
may be forced to reorganize, reduce or terminate business operations in geographical areas where our employees, partners
or subcontractors would otherwise be subject to unacceptable economic or personal risks, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.


-----

**_We may not be able to execute our growth strategy._**

We have historically expanded our business through a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth.
Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates and successfully integrate
them into our business. Acquisitions are subject to several risks and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at
commercially acceptable prices or terms. In particular, our industry is experiencing rapid consolidation which could impact
our ability to achieve our strategy. See also "—The success of our strategy depends in part on our ability to grow through
_acquisitions and integrate acquisitions into our business." Our growth strategy also depends in part on our ability to_
successfully identify and open new depots, both in countries where we already have an established presence as well as
other countries to which we may decide to expand in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify
attractive new depot locations and successfully open and operate them. Opening new depots requires significant
investments and management attention and may involve risks associated with entering new markets, including markets
where we face significant competition. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to
successfully identify and operate such new depots. Any significant diversion of management's attention, unexpected cost
associated with or any major difficulties encountered in acquiring new businesses or operating new depots could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and make it more difficult
for us to achieve our strategy. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets
could affect the timing and extent to which we can make strategic acquisitions and open new depots, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, the success of our strategy, in particular with respect to organic growth, depends on our ability to
accurately forecast trends. Our decisions about investments in new equipment, for example, are based in significant part
on our views of future demand, and any failure to accurately predict demand could negatively affect our growth prospects.
If anticipated growth does not occur, we may not earn the level of returns that we hope to achieve on investments made
during the bottom of the cycle. Alternatively, if growth is greater than expected, we may not have a fleet of appropriate
size and mix. More generally, uncertainty regarding future product demand in the markets in which we operate, or markets
in which we seek to enter, could cause us to maintain excess equipment inventory and increase our capital expenditures
beyond what is efficient. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of equipment for rental that could
result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share which could in turn materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The success of our strategy depends in part on our ability to grow through acquisitions and integrate acquisitions into_**
**_our business._**

Historically, we have achieved growth in part through acquisitions and our strategy assumes that some future
growth will occur inorganically, through further acquisitions of businesses that we believe complement or enhance our
existing products, services, markets, capabilities or technologies. For example, in February 2020, we acquired Cramo Plc
("Cramo"), a provider of equipment rental and modular space solutions and greatly expanded our operations in the Nordics.
Although the integration of the Cramo business into our Central Europe region is largely complete, we are continuing to
undertake significant integration projects with respect to management structures and back-office functions, through our
various "One-projects", including One-Finance, One-Fleet, One-HR and One-IT. A failure to successfully execute any of
these integration projects on time, on budget and as envisaged could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive
acquisition candidates in the future or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices or on
advantageous terms. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition
opportunities we have and lead to higher acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources necessary to
consummate any acquisitions or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. Furthermore, general
economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we
successfully acquire new businesses.

In general, the risks associated with acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows, include the following:

    - we may lose sales and incur substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems in
integrating acquired businesses and integration may be more costly and take longer than expected;

    - we may not achieve financial and operational synergies on a timely basis or without significant costs, if
at all;

    - acquisitions may divert management's attention from the operation of the existing business;


-----

    - the assumptions underlying the business plans supporting the valuations of the acquisitions and expected
synergies may prove inaccurate, in particular with respect to the future performance of the acquired
businesses;

    - we may be forced to divest or reduce the scope of certain businesses to obtain the necessary regulatory
authorizations, in particular with respect to anti-trust authorizations;

    - we may need to write down goodwill and certain other intangible assets from our balance sheet if our
initial estimates of the value of an acquired business are higher than actual results;

    - we may be further exposed to risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

    - we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company, which could lead to loss of
institutional knowledge and customer relationships;

    - we may not be able to retain existing customers of the acquired business;

    - we may experience corporate or market cannibalization;

    - we may face increased competition;

    - we may operate an acquired company as a joint venture with partners with whom we lack a longstanding
relationship; and

    - we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or liabilities related to the acquired businesses,
their integration and the growth of our business, particularly in geographic areas in which we have not
previously operated.

In addition to the risks described above, the integration of acquired businesses may be more difficult and take
more time due to logistical, regulatory, linguistic, cultural and other factors such as our relative lack of familiarity with a
given market and its economic, political and social dynamics. If we are not successful in implementing our acquisition
strategy or integrating such acquisitions, or if some or all of our existing or future acquisitions prove ultimately to be
unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

**_We depend on equipment manufacturers to obtain adequate rental equipment for our fleet on a timely basis._**

We purchase most of our rental equipment from well-known original equipment manufacturers. We rely on our
relationships with original equipment manufacturers to centralize our procurement and benefit from economies of scale.
Failure to maintain these relationships, or successfully optimize our economies of scale in the future, could lead to higher
unit costs for our procurement and present availability issues due to shortages of material or components such as
microchips. As we do not manufacture any of the products that we rent to our customers, we rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of the equipment, tools, spare parts and consumables that are essential to our business. However, our
suppliers may not be able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us on a timely basis or at all for logistical or strategic
reasons, including issues affecting the global supply chain generally as a result of economic disruption. Further, suppliers
may be unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us, or they may seek to renegotiate existing contracts
with us. As a result, we could face increased costs for our equipment or longer delivery times.

Delays in the delivery of new equipment may impair our ability to respond to increases in demand, put us at a
disadvantage to our competitors and may cause us to miss opportunities in our markets. For instance, equipment
manufacturers have recently faced and continue to face supply chain difficulties, in particular with respect to the raw
materials needed to manufacture chips and batteries, and as a result, we have recently experienced, and continue to
experience, delays in deliveries of purchased equipment. In addition, delays in delivery can adversely affect our equipment
maintenance and relocation costs, as there may no longer be local demand for the purchased equipment by the time it
arrives at the point of delivery. We may experience further delays or an inability to source new equipment on a timely basis
or at all. We may not be able to find alternative sources of supply for the equipment we purchase in each of our core product
categories, and the termination or delay of equipment orders by a major supplier could adversely affect our business. If we
are required to procure more costly equipment, our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to pass the cost
increases of such equipment through to our customers. Furthermore, while our top 10 suppliers at Group level only
represented approximately 11.1% of our total expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2022, our procurement
processes could be negatively affected if our business relationships with any of our top 10 suppliers are disrupted, which,
in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


-----

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_The cost of equipment purchases for our rental fleet, in addition to other operating costs, may increase._**

The cost of new equipment that we purchase for our rental fleet may increase as a result of a number of factors,
including increased raw material costs (such as costs of steel), scarcity of component parts necessary to manufacture our
rental equipment (such as microchips and batteries), increased labor costs, inflation generally or geopolitical developments
and other world events. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine destabilized the financial and commodity markets
and resulted in an uncertain macroeconomic situation in Europe, causing inflation throughout the economy, rises in interest
rates and volatile energy prices and such factors have had, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the cost of
new equipment we purchase for our rental fleet.

In particular, the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of our equipment and products, rose
sharply in 2021 as countries around the world began to recover from the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and
has continued to rise following the commencement of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine due to a combination of
sanctions against Russian producers and disruptions of production in Ukraine. While additional capacity currently exists
that can replace the foregoing volumes, increases in the spot prices of steel in Europe may nonetheless persist. Further
increases in prices of raw materials could cause the price of new equipment to rise, which could materially affect our
business to the extent that we are not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers.

In addition, we are subject to risks related to the increases in energy or transportation costs. Energy prices are in
turn subject to significant volatility caused by, among other things, inflation, market fluctuations, supply and demand,
currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, tariffs, resource availability, geopolitical developments
and other world events, as well as climate change related conditions and other factors beyond our control. High energy and
transportation costs could increase the price of new equipment purchases, which could adversely affect our business.
Additionally, higher energy and transportation costs could significantly increase our operating costs. In 2022, partially as
a result of the increase in fuel prices stemming from the conflict in Ukraine, we saw a significant increase in our logistics
costs compared to prior years. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing our logistics costs
through our hub-and-spoke logistics model or in passing along such costs to our customers. Any future increases in our
logistics costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.

Changes in customer demand due to changed technology, safety or environmental concerns, regulations, or other
factors could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment, which
would increase our costs. Further, electric, hybrid and battery powered equipment each have a purchasing cost which is
significantly higher than similar equipment using older and less environmentally friendly engines. Purchasing electric,
hybrid and battery powered equipment also incurs costs associated with training our employees and customers on the use,
maintenance, safety requirements, and repair of the new technology. Due to the significantly higher purchasing costs of
electric, hybrid and battery powered equipment our capital expenditure is expected to increase in the future. There can be
no assurances that potential maintenance costs savings will offset the expected increase in capital expenditure. These factors
in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The effective management, maintenance and repair of our rental fleet is vital to our business._**

Our rental equipment has a long economic life, and managing this equipment is a critical element to our rental
business. Rental equipment asset management requires that we build up and maintain an inventory of durable, high-quality
products that anticipate the needs of our customers and changes in technology, legislation, regulations, building codes and
local permitting in the various markets in which we operate. In addition, we must successfully maintain and repair this
equipment cost-effectively to maximize the economic life of the products and, to a lesser extent, the proceeds that may be
received from the sale of these products. As the needs of our customers change, we may need to incur costs to relocate or
retrofit our rental assets to better meet shifts in demand, beyond relocations that occur in the ordinary course of business to
maximize fleet uptime and address customer demand. In addition, if the location of our assets is not efficiently coordinated
with regional demand, we may incur costs from relocating the fleet (which includes costs associated with local regulatory
compliance, as well as transportation and storage) or we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities despite
excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our rental assets, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

In addition, where we have contracts that employ the use of our rental equipment for long durations, we may be
exposed to the risk that our costs increase materially over the term of the project, whether due to inflation, rising interest
rates or adverse movements in currency exchange rates, and we are unable to pass on those cost increases to such customers
where fixed pricing has been agreed. If the project is significant (or if there are one or more issues that impact multiple
projects) or experiences cost overruns, delays or issues with the quality or availability of supplies, any of these may have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


-----

As the equipment in our rental fleet ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain
period of time, generally increases, and we may be unable to pass along such costs to customers. Determining the optimal
average age for disposal of our rental fleet is subjective and requires considerable estimates by management. Additionally,
maintenance of newer, electric and hybrid equipment may be costlier than the maintenance cost of older gas- and dieselpowered equipment, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to pass those costs through to our customers.
Our future operating results could be adversely affected because our maintenance and repair costs may be higher than
estimated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_We are dependent on our executives, managers and employees._**

Our success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued effort and abilities of our existing management team,
including our CEO and principal ultimate shareholder, Mr. Pierre Boels Jr. Our senior management team has significant
experience in the industries and markets in which we operate. If we lose the services of any key member of our senior
management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, it may be a challenge for us to
effectively manage our business and execute our strategy.

Our success also depends on the experience and skills of our country and operational managers, district and area
managers and depot managers, who have extensive knowledge of our business and industry experience. Competition for
managers within our industry is generally significant, and, if any of our senior or regional managers joins a competitor or
forms a competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other personnel.

In addition, we depend upon the quality of our staff personnel, including sales and customer service personnel
who routinely interact with and fulfill the needs of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue
to attract, hire, train and retain qualified personnel, especially in the tight labor markets we currently face in most of the
countries in which we operate or that we will not face increases in personnel expenses in line with, or above, inflation. A
significant increase in personnel turnover or costs could negatively affect our results of operations and financial
performance. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Damage to our reputation and our brand could adversely affect our business._**

We believe that we have developed a reputation and brand images associated with a high-quality fleet of rental
equipment, customer service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility. Our brand names, trademarks and
logos, as well as their respective reputation are valuable and powerful sales and marketing tools. Litigation, employee
misconduct or the misconduct of anyone associated with the Boels brand (or any of our other brands), operational failures,
accidents, the outcome of regulatory investigations, press speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of customer
information, inadequate products and services, among others, could all affect our brand or reputation. Although our
customers are generally responsible for the way in which they handle our rental equipment and despite our efforts to
promote training and safety, accidents involving our equipment can and do occur, which can have an impact on the
perceived image of our brands. Furthermore, the Boels brand is perceived to be strongly connected to our CEO, Pierre
Boels Jr. and his family. Should Pierre Boels Jr. and his family cease to be connected to the Boels brand, for example,
through exiting the business, our customer goodwill related to the Boels brand may decline. We are also exposed to the
risk that individuals associated with the Boels brand (or any of our other brands) take actions that may affect our brand or
reputation. The occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Disruptions in our information technology systems could limit our capacity to effectively monitor and control our_**
**_operations._**

We rely on information technology systems to track and bill our services, manage our fleet, meet our customers'
needs and gather information upon which our management makes decisions regarding our business. Our information
technology systems also facilitate our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. The administration of our business
is increasingly reliant on the use of IT systems and artificial intelligence to digitalize processes and systems. The risk of a
security breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has risen as the number, intensity and
sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased. Additionally, due to the significant
efforts to digitalize our business, an increasingly larger amount of data is stored in IT systems and vulnerable to data
security breaches. Our information technology systems may not be fully protected against such third-party intrusions or
against viruses, ransom ware, or similar threats. Disruptions resulting from these threats, system crashes or other causes
could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use several ERP systems across our network and
any disruption to our ERP systems, or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the
magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results. We back-up most of our data daily, train our employees
in this regard, perform penetration testing and have a disaster recovery plan in place for most of our systems, including our


-----

ERP system. However, our disaster recovery plan does not cover all of our systems. Our back-up systems may fail, and
any recovery of our data may be incomplete or subject to delay.

In addition, because our systems may contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to
appropriately safeguard the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors
of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities. In most of the regions in which we operate, the
processing of personal data is subject to governmental regulation and legislation. Any failure to comply with such
regulations or legislation could lead to governmental sanctions, including fines or the initiation of criminal or civil
proceedings. In the European Union, we must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws that restrict our ability
to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, including the marketing use of that
information. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (known as the "General Data Protection
**Regulation" or "GDPR"), which became applicable on May 25, 2018, increased both the number of and the restrictive**
nature of the obligations binding on us for the collection and processing of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to
the supervision of relevant data protection authorities under the GDPR and, with respect to our operations in the United
Kingdom, the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the "UK GDPR"), and
could be fined under each of those regimes independently in respect of the same breach. Although we collect and store a
limited amount of personal data, and have proper registrations in place, failure to comply with the provisions of GDPR or
UK GDPR could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business and reputation may be adversely affected by the actions of third parties._**

In our business, we rely on third-party partners for the provision of certain services, such as collections, IT systems
and transport services. If a partner is unable to deliver its services or a supplier is unable to deliver equipment according to
the pre-agreed terms or in a timely manner, our reputation may suffer, and we may be required to purchase such goods or
services from another source at a higher price. We may not be able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances, which
may reduce the profit expected to be realized under such agreements or result in a loss. Moreover, if we purchase services
from a third party that is not one of our ordinary providers, there is a risk that we may fail to deliver such services at the
quality standards that our customers have been accustomated to, which could be detrimental to our reputation and our
relationships with our customers.

While we carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk, and have
established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions, we may be
affected by the inappropriate, fraudulent, negligent, unauthorized or criminal activities of third parties, including
employees, suppliers, customers and subcontractors, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be exposed to fraud or other misconduct committed by our
employees, representatives, agents, customers or other third parties that could affect our reputation and subject us to
litigation, financial  losses and regulatory action. Such misconduct could include hiding unauthorized or unlawful
activities resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks of losses, theft of equipment, improperly using or disclosing
confidential information, misappropriating funds, engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise
improper activities or otherwise failing to comply with applicable laws or our internal policies and procedures. Actions
taken by third-party partners acting as our agents may also subject us to vicarious liability suits.

Additionally, our digitalization strategy requires us to increasingly rely on third-party providers to maintain our
IT systems and to perform certain core business processes for our websites, ERP tools, asset monitoring and maintenance
systems, online platforms and data systems. Outsourcing these processes exposes us to various risks, such as loss of control,
data breaches, service disruptions, quality issues, contractual disputes and increased costs. We may not be able to monitor,
manage, or remedy the performance or compliance of our IT service providers effectively or in a timely manner. We may
also face difficulties in finding alternative or backup IT service providers in the event of termination, dissatisfaction, or
insolvency of our current IT service providers. Failure to maintain our IT systems could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Seasonality and severe weather conditions may cause fluctuations and disruptions in our business._**

Our revenue and operating results have historically varied from period to period. In particular, many of the markets
in which our customers operate are characterized by seasonal cycles causing our operations to experience a degree of
seasonality in the first quarter of each year, driven principally by climatic conditions in our different regions of operations.
Demand in the civil engineering, construction, infrastructure and other industrial markets tends to decrease in winter and
during extended periods of inclement weather while increasing in the summer and during extended periods of mild weather.
Additionally, severe weather events, such as storms, floods and blizzards, can suppress activity in the civil engineering,
industrial markets, construction and infrastructure markets, which can adversely impact our business, financial condition,
results of operation and cash flows.


-----

**_We may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by our insurance policies._**

We carry insurance of various types, including but not limited to, property damage insurance, general liability
coverage and directors' liability insurance. We may not always be able to accurately foresee all activities and situations in
order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, our insurance may not
cover such risks adequately or at all. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable,
and we may experience incidents of a nature that are not covered by insurance. Any significant uninsured liability may
require us to pay substantial amounts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Further, we may be exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles, and, as a result, we could incur
significant out-of-pocket costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the
cost of our insurance policies may increase upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type
of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Our current insurance policies
may not continue to be available in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay
significantly higher premiums for insurance or are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates, we could
experience higher costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition._**

Our approach to fleet management is to replace equipment only at the end of its useful rental life, at which time it
is sold, used for parts or sold for scrap. Usually, a piece of equipment is amortized at least to the level of its residual value
by the time it is removed from the fleet. Nonetheless, the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less
than its depreciated value or residual value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on
several factors, including:

    - general economic conditions;

    - worldwide and domestic demands for used equipment;

    - the supply of used equipment on the market;

    - the market price for new equipment of the same kind;

    - wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; and

    - technological developments.

Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**Financial Risks**

**_Unfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets and political uncertainty may adversely affect business_**
**_conditions and our access to credit needed to maintain and grow our business._**

Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of an economic downturn, economic uncertainty,
regulatory changes, financial institution failures, armed conflict, pandemics, trade wars or other factors could adversely
affect our ability to access liquidity to invest in our equipment fleet. In addition, bank failures, liquidity concerns and other
adverse developments affecting financial institutions, or rumors about such events, may impact the stability of global
financial markets. In the event of weakening macroeconomic conditions, our customers may face challenges to obtain
financing for their projects from lenders or in the capital and credit markets, which may cause some of our customers to be
unable to meet their payment obligations to us, increasing losses on bad debt. Delinquencies and credit losses generally
can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. See "—We are exposed to counterparty risks and
_may incur losses because of such exposure." Moreover, our suppliers may also be adversely impacted by unfavorable_
capital and credit markets, causing disruption to or delay of product deliveries. Political uncertainty may also negatively
impact the capital and credit markets, including through changes in foreign policy or regulatory requirements, trade
restrictions or sanctions, higher tariffs and changes to existing, or the imposition of additional, regulations relating to the
import or export of products. In addition, if the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us, or from
which we may seek credit commitments in the future, were to be adversely affected by conditions in the capital and credit
markets, they might be unable or unwilling to fund borrowings under such credit commitments, which could have an


-----

adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for capital expenditures, working
capital, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes.

Global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption as a result of various macroeconomic factors, including
global inflationary pressures and monetary policy tightening, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and trade tensions
between the United States and China. Capital markets have been and may continue to be impacted by inflation, which is
currently the case in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and there are concerns that current inflationary pressures
could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, decreases in global stock exchange
indices, increased foreign exchange volatility and decreased GDP in the markets in which we operate. In addition, there
are concerns that these events could push the Eurozone, the United Kingdom and/or the United States into an economic
recession, any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial markets. Any of the events
described above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Fluctuations in interest rates could increase our finance costs._**

Material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and
expectations that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven in part by the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets), have led central banks of the major world economies, including the
U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase market interest rates in a short timeframe.
Our finance costs are sensitive to interest rates, exchange rates and other monetary policies of governments and central
banks in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We and certain of our subsidiaries borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates, which exposes us to the
risk of rising interest rates, and on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, a significant amount of our
indebtedness will bear interest at a floating rate. Although we seek to hedge against our interest-bearing liabilities through
interest rate swaps, these instruments may not be effective or available in all circumstances. A sustained increase in inflation
may result in higher interest rates on our borrowings (including finance leases) that are subject to a floating rate of interest,
increasing our financial expenses and cost of borrowing. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six
months ended June 30, 2023, we experienced an increase in financial expenses due to the rise in EURIBOR, which resulted
in higher interest payments on our unhedged floating rate borrowings. In addition, we may not be able to refinance such
debt in the future at interest rates that are as favorable as the ones currently applicable to our borrowings. See "—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Some of our indebtedness, including the Existing Senior_
_Facilities, bears interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow."_

**_Our business could be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required._**

We require capital for, among other things, purchasing rental equipment, opening new branches, expanding our
business, completing acquisitions and refinancing existing debt. Our ability to make principal or interest payments when
due on our indebtedness and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to
generate cash. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our debt facilities,
including our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and our Trade Receivables Purchase Program. This cash may be
insufficient, and we may require additional financing to obtain capital for, among other purposes, operating expenses,
capital expenditures, working capital requirements, acquisitions and debt service payments. Additionally, there is the risk
that our capital expenditures will increase due to ineffective planning of investments or asset sales. See "—Risks related to
_our Business—We may not be able to execute our growth strategy" and "—Risks related to our Business—The success of_
_our strategy depends in part on our ability to grow through acquisitions and integrate acquisitions into our business."_
There can be no assurance that any additional financing that we require will be available or, if available, will be available
on terms that are satisfactory to us.

In addition, in the future, we may need to rely on different sources of financing for our capital expenditures, the
level of which significantly affects the age and size of our equipment fleet, and if we are required to reduce these
expenditures for any reason, the reduced availability of equipment or the age of our rental fleet may cause us competitive
harm and increase our maintenance costs. Any additional indebtedness that we incur will make us more vulnerable to
economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results_**
**_of operations and cash flows._**

Although we prepare our consolidated financial statements in euro, we derive revenue and incur costs in several
different currencies, including the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone, the Danish krone, the British pound, the Polish
zloty, Swiss franc and the Czech koruna. Accordingly, movements in exchange rates between any of these currencies and
euro could have an adverse effect on our results of operations to the extent we have a mismatch between our earnings in


-----

any foreign currency and our costs that are denominated in that currency. We also incur currency risk on the net investment
in our subsidiaries in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom.
The results of operations and financial position of these subsidiaries are reported in the relevant functional currency of that
subsidiary. These subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are converted to euro based on the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date, and income statement items are converted to euro based on the average exchange rate during the relevant financial
period. Significant increases in the value of the euro relative to foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position and results of operations. Although we routinely engage in derivative transactions to hedge against
any such fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against such risks. For example, our
revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was negatively affected by the weakening of the Swedish krona, Norwegian
krone and the British pound against the euro. If we are exposed to significant adverse movements in foreign currency rates
in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

**_We are exposed to counterparty risks and may incur losses because of such exposure._**

Although our top 10 customers at Group level only represented approximately 7.4% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022, our business would be adversely affected if one or more of our key customers were to have
liquidity problems and be unable to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. Delinquencies and credit losses
generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. In case of such default in payment
obligations, we may be unable to collect some or all of receivables due to us, in which case some or all outstanding amounts
would need to be written off and we would need to seek alternative sources of funding for our working capital requirements.
If we were to experience any disputes or a significant reduction in or loss of business with one or more customers, or if one
or more customers were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Furthermore, should a supplier or service provider counterparty become insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its
obligations, we may need to find a replacement to carry out such supply obligations or we may need to fulfill certain service
obligations ourselves, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows. Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty risk from our financial investments, derivative financial
instruments and deposits with financial institutions. If a counterparty fails to honor a payment obligation, such a loss will
negatively impact our results of obligations and cash flows. Although we have adopted policies to manage this credit risk
exposure, those policies may not prove effective against the risk of default by, or the insolvency of, one or more
counterparties.

**_We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures in_**
**_this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain_**
**_estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them._**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain statements and figures relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures
of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS standards or other generally accepted accounting principles. The
Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as
alternatives to operating profit or profit from ordinary operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance
with IFRS or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and other metrics calculated using Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA include estimated results of acquired businesses assuming
such acquisitions were made at the beginning of the period presented. We calculated such figures using information and
records available from the acquired businesses, which in certain instances was based on unaudited financial information or
management schedules and therefore required significant assumptions and estimates, may not be up to date or may not be
prepared on the same basis on which we prepare our accounts. While these figures are based upon the latest available
financial information from the acquired business, actual figures may differ. Such figures represent a simple aggregation of
relevant financial information of the Group and certain acquired businesses. Such information does not reflect any
accounting or pro forma adjustments that may be required to present consolidated financial information. This adjustment
is for illustrative purposes only. While we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, some or all of this
information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete. As a result, you should not unduly rely on such information in
making an investment in the Notes.

**_Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior financial_**
**_statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP._**

We first prepared annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and in accordance with Title
9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the year ended December 31, 2022. Until December 31, 2021, we prepared our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP. Accordingly, we prepared consolidated financial
statements that comply with IFRS as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022, together with the comparative period


-----

data as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021. In preparing the FY 2022 Financial Statements, our opening statement
of financial position was prepared as at January 1, 2021, the date of our transition to IFRS.

As Dutch GAAP differs in significant respects from IFRS, the adoption of IFRS greatly reduces the comparability
of the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared under IFRS with the FY 2021 Financial Statements and the FY 2020
Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. In particular, the transition to IFRS resulted in changes to
our accounting policies, methods, estimates, judgments, and disclosures, which affected our reported assets, liabilities,
equity, income, expenses, and cash flows. In this Offering Memorandum, we present our historical financial condition and
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as derived from the comparative financial information as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS
and for the year ended December 31, 2020 as derived from the opening statement of financial position as of January 1,
2021 included in Note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and the Reconciled
Financial Information. See "Presentation of Financial Information." The Reconciled Financial Information for the year
ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared by management to aid in the understanding of our financial information on a
more comparable basis with our financial information for subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain management assumptions and estimates, has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the Reconciled Financial Information addresses a
hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a true picture of our results for the year ended
December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS for such period. For example,
the Reconciled Financial Information has not retrospectively applied the IFRS requirements for business combinations as
at January 1, 2020. The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial
information for subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an
understanding of: (i) the differences between Dutch GAAP, IFRS and other systems of generally accepted accounting
principles and how those differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum; and
(ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, IFRS may have on the financial information presented in this
Offering Memorandum, our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods.

_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—_

_Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS", and the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes_
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Risks related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment**

**_We are subject to stringent environmental and safety requirements, which can be costly to comply with and may subject_**
**_us to liability._**

We store equipment and machinery as well as use and temporarily store fuels and certain chemicals at a variety
of properties in jurisdictions where we have operations, any of which may subject us to stringent environmental
requirements. We also lease or own properties on which industrial activities may have been conducted in the past and there
may be contamination for which we could become liable for clean-up. As such, we may use hazardous materials to clean
and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and
dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations. In
connection with these activities, we could contaminate soil, air, water and buildings or cause spills, emissions, leakages or
other accidents. We are subject to a variety of environmental regulatory regimes that impose obligations and liability for
the clean-up of properties affected by hazardous substance spills or releases. Such liabilities may be imposed on the parties
generating or disposing of such substances or the operator of the affected property, often without regard to whether the
owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the relevant incident. Accordingly, we may become liable, either
contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if a contaminated property is not presently owned or
operated by us or if the contamination was caused by third parties. In addition, we may be liable for the loss of property
value caused by such an incident and prior site assessments or investigations may not have identified all potential instances
of contamination or the full extent thereof. Future events, including changes in existing laws or policies or their
enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown or undetected incidents, may give rise to additional remediation
liabilities, which may be material. Further, we could also become subject to proceedings where a third party sues us due to
a breach of environmental legislation and be ordered to pay damages or be subject to other sanctions. We have made and
will continue to make capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these environmental and safety compliance
and/or remediation laws and regulations. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently,
and could become more stringent in the future. We may not be in complete compliance with all such requirements at all
times, and we may be subject to potentially significant civil or criminal fines or penalties if we fail to comply. If any of the
risks described above materialize, they may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.


-----

**_We are subject to risks related to environmental, social and governance matters, including the failure to meet certain of_**
**_our targets._**

We must increasingly meet environmental, social and governance ("ESG") standards and expectations regarding
environmental concerns (such as climate change and sustainability), social concerns (such as diversity, inclusion and human
rights) and corporate governance concerns (such as taking employee relations into account when making business and
investment decisions). Complying with certain ESG standards and expectations, in particular environmental standards, may
pose challenges to our business and could lead to additional costs.

We have set a number of targets with respect to ESG matters. These include ambitious sustainability and
environmental targets relating to our emissions and the sustainability of our fleet, among others. We have also set a number
of diversity and employee satisfaction targets with respect to our business. See "Business—Environmental, Social and
_Governance." Any failure to achieve such targets could damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain key_
personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In particular, our emissions targets and targets relating to the development of our green fleet involve significant
costs and are based on numerous assumptions, including, among others, the development or commercial viability of new
technologies and sustainable equipment. Moreover, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply and pricing of
sustainable equipment, which could impact the level of capital expenditure required to meet our targets. If any of these
assumptions do not materialize, we may be unable to achieve our targets within the set timeframe or without incurring
prohibitive costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims._**

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy
and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions that we may initiate, can often be expensive and time-consuming
and can divert management's attention from the operation of the business. Unfavorable outcomes from claims or lawsuits
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also suffer
reputational harm, incur substantial monetary liability and be required to change our business practices or implement new
systems or procedures which may be costly.

Our business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the
equipment we rent, for injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which our delivery and service personnel are involved
and for other employee-related matters. Additionally, we could be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance
with various laws and governmental regulations, such as those relating to employment, health, safety, security and other
regulations under which we operate. Such litigation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our risk management, internal controls and compliance processes may fail to detect, prevent and address the risks we_**
**_face and, as a result, we may be subject to regulatory penalties and reputational damage._**

We operate a decentralized business through hundreds of depots across Europe. Our internal control and
compliance processes may not prevent all future breaches of law, accounting standards or our internal codes of conduct or
to otherwise detect, prevent and address the various risks we face. We may experience instances of fraudulent behavior
and dishonesty by our employees, contractors or other agents. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and
other standards could lead to fines, legal proceedings, loss of operating licenses and reputational harm, which could in turn
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

This risk has increased as a result of our acquisitions and organic growth. In recent years, we have expanded the
size and scope of our operations, including most significantly with the acquisition of Cramo in 2020, and we may continue
to pursue such growth in the future. As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is an increased risk that our
internal controls may not mature at the same pace.

Further, we may be unsuccessful in deploying internal control systems across all of our operating subsidiaries,
and the internal control systems we put in place may be inadequate or ineffective in certain circumstances, particularly if
we are confronted with risks that we have not fully or adequately identified or anticipated. Any such failures of our internal
control systems could adversely impact our ability to monitor local operations and to deploy strategy across our business,
could result in damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business is subject to various legal and regulatory compliance risks, including those involving antitrust, anti-money_**
**_laundering, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations and sanctions._**

We are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements and risks in the countries in which we are
commercially active or have local operations, involving compliance with antitrust, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and
anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other regulations and
economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union, the United
Kingdom and the United States. In addition, sanctions imposed by international organizations or individual nations, such
as the sanctions imposed as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine, restrict or prohibit transactions with certain countries,
and with certain companies and individuals identified on lists maintained by the United Nations, the U.S. federal
government, the European Union, various EU member states, the United Kingdom and other local governments. In
particular, the sanctions imposed as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine could impact our ability to sell, and the price
we are able to obtain for, our interest in Fortrent, including requirements to obtain various government approvals for such
a transaction and the transfer of the proceeds thereof. We may be unaware of, or unable to timely anticipate and prepare
for, developments in such laws, regulations and sanctions, and any of our employees, agents, third-party providers or any
other representatives involved in our business may take actions in violation of such laws and regulations, any of which may
subject us to legal or regulatory action by governments or regulators.

Despite the fact that we operate a compliance program, our existing policies, procedures, training, whistleblower
hotline, IT tools, internal controls and risk management in relation to antitrust, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery or anticorruption laws and regulations and sanctions, may not be sufficient in order to prevent or detect inadequate practices,
fraud and violations of law by our employees, agents, third-party providers or any other representatives. For example, in
the case that any employees, agents, third-party providers or any other representatives with whom we cooperate receive or
grant inappropriate benefits or use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices, we could be confronted with legal
sanctions, penalties, loss of business as well as harm to our reputation. Due to the increasing complexity, size and
geographical spread of our operations and the extent of our reliance on employees, agents, third-party providers or any
other representatives, it may become more difficult to effectively monitor and control all of our activities, particularly in
markets which are known to be more prone to bribery, corruption and other compliance risks. As a result, our policies,
procedures, internal controls and risk management may not be adequate.

Failure to comply with antitrust, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations,
sanctions laws and regulations could expose us and our officers, directors and employees to civil and criminal prosecution
and penalties, enforcement actions, the imposition of fines or export or economic sanctions, loss of business or reputational
damage, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_We are subject to laws and regulations governing labor, compliance with which entails cost and risk, and labor disputes_**
**_could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

Labor laws applicable to our business in the countries where we operate are extensive and compliance therewith
entails significant cost and management attention, particularly so in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. In the
countries in which we operate, labor laws generally provide for strong protection of employees' interests, which may be at
odds with the interests of our business. In addition, many of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable
regulations, represented by works councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the
consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in connection with managing, developing or restructuring
certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to
employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even
where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by
some employees and employees' representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business.
We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our business in
certain countries, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees'
interests. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by
work councils or other bodies. Additionally, many of our suppliers and customers have unionized work forces. Strikes,
work-stoppages or work-slowdowns experienced by these suppliers or customers could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See "Business—Employees."

**_Changes in applicable law and regulations, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs,_**
**_expose us to liability and have other negative impacts on our business._**

We are exposed to a wide variety of EU, national and local regulations. See "—Risks related to our Business—
_Our international operations expose us to risks inherent to international business, any of which could materially adversely_
_affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows." These laws and requirements address_


-----

multiple aspects of our operations including, among other things, workplace health and safety, product safety, consumer
rights and labor relations, and such laws and regulations differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

In addition, changes in regulations could impact the ability of rental operators to utilize their equipment in certain
types of projects, affecting the competitive landscape in those projects, as well as in other areas in which the nonconforming equipment may be redeployed. Changes in regulatory requirements, or any material failure to comply with
them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, require significant management attention and
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We are subject to tax laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate, which may be subject to
change from time to time. Our effective tax rate in any given financial year reflects a variety of factors that may not be
present in succeeding financial years and may be affected by the interpretation of the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which
we operate or changes to such laws. Changes in tax laws and related interpretations and increased enforcement actions and
penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. In addition, certain tax positions that we take are based on
industry practice and external tax advice and/or are based on assumptions that involve a significant degree of judgment. If
challenges to our tax positions (through audits or otherwise) were to be successful, we may be required to pay additional
taxes, penalty charges and interest and may incur costs in defending litigation or reaching a settlement with the relevant
tax authority. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
operate. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards
enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross
receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities
agree with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of
additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products
or services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The implementation of Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of 14 December 2022 on ensuring a global minimum level of_**
**_taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the European Union may result in a_**
**_higher tax burden for the Group which could have a negative effect on the Group's solvency and financial condition_**

The Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ("Pillar Two"), an initiative by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework,
introduces a minimum level of taxation for multinationals with annual consolidated revenue of €750 million or more in at
least two out of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year. The aim of Pillar Two is to ensure that
large multinational enterprise groups are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each jurisdiction where they
operate.

The Council of the European Union (the EU) formally adopted Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (the "Pillar
**Two Directive"). The Pillar Two Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 December**
2022. EU member states need to implement the Pillar Two Directive in their national laws by December 31, 2023. On May
31, 2023, the Dutch legislator published a legislative proposal for the implementation of Pillar Two in Dutch law.

The primary mechanism for implementation of Pillar Two will be an income inclusion rule (the "IIR") pursuant
to which a top-up tax is payable by a parent entity of a group if one or more constituent members of the group have been
undertaxed. In the situation that no IIR applies at the ultimate parent entity level, a lower level parent entity may be required
to apply the IIR. A secondary fall back is provided by an undertaxed payment rule (the "UTPR") in case the IIR has not
been applied. The UTPR can be applied by (i) limiting or denying a deduction or (ii) making an adjustment in the form of
an additional tax. In the legislative proposal of May 31, 2023, the Netherlands opted for option (ii) i.e. to make an
adjustment in the form of an additional tax. In addition, and in line with the Pillar Two Directive, the legislative proposal
of May 31, 2023 also includes a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (the "QDMTT"). A jurisdiction that incorporates
the QDMTT becomes the first in line to levy any top-up tax from entities located in its jurisdiction. It must compute profits
and calculate any top-up tax due in the same way as the Pillar Two rules. Without a QDMTT, another jurisdiction as
determined by the Pillar Two rules would be entitled to levy the top-up tax.

The implementation of the Pillar Two Directive could result in a higher tax burden for the Group which could
have a negative effect on the Group's solvency and financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure**

**_Our leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As of June 30, 2023, our as adjusted total net debt after giving effect to the Transactions would have been €1,906.6
million on a consolidated basis. After giving effect to the Transactions, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be
undrawn on the Issue Date and provide for aggregate borrowings of up to €179.3 million. See "Use of Proceeds,"
"Capitalization" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."

Our leverage can have important consequences for our business and operations, including:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Existing Senior
Facilities and our other debt and liabilities;

    - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital
expenditure and for other general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to
cash flow;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

    - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and creditors;

    - exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate debt instruments, including the
Existing Senior Facilities;

    - limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit
market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other
terms acceptable to us or at all;

    - restricting us from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs
of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness that could further increase our leverage, exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial indebtedness and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes._**

We may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt, to fund
any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. Although the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement contains, and
the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject, and will
be subject, as applicable, to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the
amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial.

In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may
decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time. Any
such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be
offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest rate with respect to
any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater
than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt
that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In
addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may
be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt
would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the


-----

Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such additional debt or
that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or
incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt and the
Notes, the leverage related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in
this "Risk Factors" section, could intensify.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs_**
**_to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Among other things, the Indenture will limit, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

    - make certain other restricted payments;

    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

    - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

    - transfer or sell assets;

    - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

    - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement requires the Group to comply with certain negative and
affirmative covenants, including a financial covenant to maintain a certain total net leverage ratio. See "Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement." Our ability to meet these covenants and restrictions can_
be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet them.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements." These covenants could limit our ability to_
finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may
be in our interest.

Any future debt agreements that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries enters into may have covenants that are even
more restrictive. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants and any future provisions, we will be in default under the
Indenture and/or the relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or the applicable
creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest on the Notes or the applicable amounts immediately due and
payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to an event of default and acceleration
under our other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our
creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of
our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which
would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are
unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of
those amounts. These restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs
or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. See "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants"
and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate or_**
**_raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our obligations under
the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, or to refinance our debt and to fund our
ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, discussed in these "Risk Factors," many
of which are beyond our control.


-----

In addition, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €179.3 million. If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations or
meet other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance
or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing or restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we
may be forced to, among others:

    - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditure;

    - sell assets;

    - raise additional debt or equity financing; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

If any of the above were to occur, the holders of our debt may be able to accelerate our debt and, to the extent
such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales
or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient cash or sources of cash to repay all of our debt. In
addition, the terms of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may limit
our ability to pursue any of these measures. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require
us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of
operations. There can be no assurance that any assets, which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if
sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. Furthermore, any
failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could impact our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future.

**_The Existing Senior Facilities will mature prior to the Notes and the Issuer may not be able to repay, redeem or otherwise_**
**_refinance such indebtedness._**

On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, €1,250 million is expected to be outstanding under
the Existing Term Loan B and €179.3 million will be available for drawing under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.
The Existing Term Loan B will mature in 2027 and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility will mature in 2026. An inability
to repay, delay in refinancing, or the inability to refinance on commercially acceptable terms debt falling due in accordance
with the maturity schedule of our indebtedness may result in an acceleration of such debt, and enforcement over our assets,
including the Collateral collectively securing the Notes, the Existing Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (if
any). The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in
the financial markets. The refinancing of existing debt may be on different terms than our current ones, which, among other
things, could drive an increase in debt service costs, thereby restricting our degree of flexibility. If we are unable to
refinance our debt when due, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Furthermore, any failure to
repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities may result in a default under the Notes as a result of the
cross-default provisions set forth in the Indenture. For details of the maturity profile of our debt, see "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Contractual Obligations."_

**_Some of our indebtedness, including the Existing Senior Facilities, bears interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Some of our indebtedness, including the Existing Senior Facilities, bears and future indebtedness that we may
incur could bear, interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR (as applicable) as adjusted periodically,
plus a spread. These interest rates have risen significantly in recent years and could rise significantly in the future. Although
we have entered or may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no
assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the
extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly
increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including historic EURIBOR) have been the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU
Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented. The Existing Senior
Facilities bear interest at interest rates tied to EURIBOR.


-----

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical
benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other
pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as
a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or
participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, you
should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate
benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including
to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of
their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not
transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be
determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations,
although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may
not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement
of an independent financial institution, the successor rate mechanism provided for by the agreements governing our floating
rate debt may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the
manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt.
Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If
EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for
the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**_The Issuer depends upon cash flow from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other
distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The subsidiaries intend to
provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations under the Notes through a combination of dividends, interest
payments on intercompany loans and repayment of intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be
junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or Guarantees of obligations under, the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows
of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. If our subsidiaries do not
fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on
the Notes, the Issuer will not have sufficient sources of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the
Notes. Further, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay planned expansions or capital expenditure, sell significant assets, discontinue specified operations or obtain
additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on
or before maturity.

In addition, the Issuer's subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to the Issuer under some
circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under applicable corporate law, and
contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the
Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may subject
such payments to further taxation and applicable corporate law may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, our
ability to pay dividends to the Issuer may generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to us.
Finally, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to
any of the Notes. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the Issuer's obligations, they may not be
permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in the restricted group to another entity in the restricted group in
order to make payments to the Issuer.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The Issuer's non-Guarantor subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to
make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor
subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority


-----

with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims
by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets
of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each
Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including trade creditors and preference shareholders (if
any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

The Indenture will include provisions that may require us to cause certain of our other Restricted Subsidiaries to
guarantee the Notes in certain future circumstances, subject to applicable legal limitations and cost considerations. See
"Description of the Notes." However, there can be no assurance that these provisions will ever be triggered in the future
and, if triggered, not defeated by such legal limitations and cost considerations. Consequently, there can be no assurance
that any additional Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes in the future.

The Indenture as well as our other indebtedness allow non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the
future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer's direct and
indirect subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes did not have any material external borrowings outstanding. In
addition, our Financial Statements include both Guarantor and non-Guarantor subsidiaries and, as such, may be of limited
use in assessing the financial position of the Guarantors.

**_The Collateral only extends to certain of our assets and the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and applicable perfection requirements, by
security interests in the Collateral described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures our obligations
under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations. The Collateral may also secure additional
debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the
first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the
Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies
in which operations are located, the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the
jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair
market value and condition of the Collateral.

The Collateral may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may
not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral
will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure,
the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold
such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement
of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory
consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain
or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and
the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible
that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by such Collateral. With respect
to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited
value in the event of bankruptcy and/or judicial liquidation, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's
shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity.

As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities, including holders of the Notes, may
not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over
time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to
the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated
claim against the Issuer's and any Guarantor's remaining assets.

The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a
portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial
delay in our liquidation.


-----

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

Our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a pari passu basis with security interests
over the Collateral, which Collateral also secures our obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations. The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the
terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only
enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group
that, prior to the discharge of all senior liabilities (including the Notes), consists of the holders of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders' commitments under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the
hedge counterparties’ senior obligations that are owed senior hedging liabilities and any other senior creditors or other
noteholders in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors (the "Senior Credit Participations")
which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Credit Participations at that time (the "Majority Senior Creditors")
(in each case, acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Creditors do not instruct the
Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing, the transaction security, then, in certain cases,
junior creditors holding more than an agreed percentage of the junior credit participations (such percentage being prescribed
in the relevant second lien facility agreement) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds, or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities, or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has
grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is
not reasonably assured to it. In connection with acting in accordance with any instructions received by it, the Security
Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any creditor or group of creditors until it has received
any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require.

To the extent we incur additional senior indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be further diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as
a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens
over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement", "Description of the Notes—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees"_
And "Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Security."

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement,
counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness as
to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event,
the holders of the Notes would be bound by any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to
such holders of the Notes. The creditors under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and holders of any other senior
secured debt entitled to provide instructions regarding enforcement may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes and such creditors may elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when
it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents, or to exercise any rights or
powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions and accepted the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse
against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement."_

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that we may incur to the extent_**
**_such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that
is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing
such indebtedness. Further, although the Indenture will restrict the Issuer's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' (as defined
herein) ability to pledge any assets as collateral to secure other debt, and will require the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to secure the Notes equally and ratably if the Issuer pledges any assets for the benefit of certain other debt,


-----

both the restriction on pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes and the
Guarantees are subject to a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See "Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens." For example, if the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security_
interests securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of the
Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or the Guarantees equally and ratably. To the extent, the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt or other obligations without also securing
the Notes and the Guarantees, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to such debt or other
obligations to the extent of the value of such assets. For example, the Existing Senior Facilities currently benefit from
residual pledges over the share capital of certain non-material subsidiaries in Austria, Poland, Italy and the Czech Republic
that previously guaranteed the Existing Senior Facilities as well as security over certain bank accounts and certain
intercompany receivables of said non-material subsidiary in the Czech Republic, that will not secure the Notes. The Issuer
may seek majority lender consent pursuant to the terms of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement to release such security
at a future date. In addition, the Trade Receivables Purchase Program is currently expected to be secured on a first priority
basis by certain collection accounts for trade receivables in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, that will not secure
the Notes.

Because of the foregoing, holders of (present or future) secured debt or other obligations of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may recover disproportionately more on their claims than the holders of the Notes in an insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding. The Issuer and the Guarantors may not have sufficient assets remaining to satisfy their
respective obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting_**
**_of Guarantees or security interests during which such Guarantees or security interests may be challenged in accordance_**
**_with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create or restart hardening periods for
such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting or extension of shared security interests to
secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in
particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for
these new or extended security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected
or extended. At each time, if the Guarantee or security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of
the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations."_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for
the benefit of holders of the Notes. See "Description of the Notes—Security."

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce_**
**_certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections as may be accepted by the Security Agent and any other creditors that have the benefit of pari passu security
interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any
such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral
securing the Notes, as well as the ability to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the pari passu ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Specifically, the Collateral is located
in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and the multijurisdictional nature of any enforcement of the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or
conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to
obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically
complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors' rights.
The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's law should
apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

In addition, the security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of
security interests in Collateral. For example, under the laws in certain of the jurisdictions where the Collateral is located,


-----

the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements.
See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations." Third-party consent may be needed to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that any such_
consents will be obtained. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The Issuer, the Parent and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents (subject to certain exceptions) will allow the Issuer, the Parent and the Guarantors to
remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from
the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture or a continuing acceleration
event under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among
other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the Issuer's obligations under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in
favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through
the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of
the Collateral. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. For further information, see
"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations."_

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects. Other
creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence an enforcement action against the Issuer or its
subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable
bankruptcy laws or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced.

**_Holders of the Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement to implement parity among the_**
**_secured parties._**

In certain jurisdictions, the liens securing the Notes are subject to legal doctrines that effectively rank them behind
the liens in favor of earlier incurred obligations, in particular the liens in favor of the Existing Senior Facilities, and certain
hedging obligations. In such a case, the Notes will be secured by a security interest in the Collateral ranking after any thenexisting security interest granted over the Collateral. However, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Notes will be treated and deemed to be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement. Therefore, the pari passu right in the Collateral to be granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will depend
on the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were
found to be invalid or held to be unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the holders
of the Notes would not benefit from such pari passu treatment and the security interests granted in favor of the holders of
the Notes would rank behind, and be subordinated to, any prior-ranking security interests, including the security interests
granted in favor of the lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement."_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes_**
**_and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including upon a
sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the
Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the
Guarantees may be released automatically, including upon a sale, transfer or other disposal of the capital stock of a
Guarantor in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture or when the Issuer designates one
or more Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined herein). If the Issuer designates
a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such
subsidiary and any Guarantees provided by such subsidiary will also be released under the Indenture, subject to certain


-----

conditions. Designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the
Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. In addition, the
Indenture will provide that the applicable Guarantees may be released automatically, without action by, or consent of, any
holder of the Notes or the Trustee, if the Guarantor is no longer a guarantor under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.
Investors in the Notes will not have a direct claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor of the
Notes. See "Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Security" and "Description of the Notes—Guarantees—Release
_of the Guarantees." In addition, the Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal_
as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement."_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security.
The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if
we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests. In addition,
certain applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such
as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral, or any allowance to delay such perfection, may result
in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority and enforcement of such security interest in
favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest
in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any
steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens. Such unperfected security interests are vulnerable
under applicable provisions of relevant law of being set aside as a preference in any applicable insolvency proceeding
affecting the security provider.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In
addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security
Documents. There can be no assurance that the value of the Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims
under the Notes. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value
of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest or to the secured amount stated in the relevant Security
Document (which may be lower than the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest), and
the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under
Dutch, Austrian, Belgian, English, Finnish, German, Norwegian, Swedish or other applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include
those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, unfair or voidable preference and insolvent
transactions, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance, related party transactions, security registration
or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See "Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
Guarantees and security interests can be challenged (for example, by the bankruptcy receiver or insolvency trustee, in the
case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court
could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed
by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Guarantees or the security interests granted under
the Security Documents) or by any party granting the security interests and, if payment had already been made under a
Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent
transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or to the party granting the security interests, if the court
found, inter alia, that:

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant
Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

    - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or of the party granting the security
interests or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or the
above-referred party was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;


-----

    - the Guarantor or the party granting the security interests did not receive fair consideration or reasonably
equivalent value for granting the relevant Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor or such party
was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest;
(ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security Document;
or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity; or

    - the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate
benefit of the Guarantor or of such party.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a party granting
the security interests was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of
whether or not a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or its security interests were
granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted unfair or voidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or voidable
conveyances on other grounds.

In addition, under German law, among others, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or security interest granted
by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an
enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be
void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the
debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant Collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of
subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of
the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or security interest could become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal
principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware
of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security interest was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

Further, the Security Documents will provide that the Security Agent must not enforce the security rights granted
by the Guarantors incorporated in Germany over the Collateral to the extent enforcement of the Collateral would result in
the amount of the Guarantor's net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code
(i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) to fall below its stated share capital or increases or would increase an
existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital and thereby violating sections 30 and 31 of the German Limited
Liability Companies Act. Furthermore, the enforcement of the Collateral granted by such German Guarantors may be
excluded (entirely) pursuant to certain limitations contained in the relevant Security Documents, in case the granting or
enforcement of such Collateral and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so secured finance party
under such Collateral. These limitations may have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the security interests
over the Collateral, potentially even to zero. See _"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the_
_Guarantees and_ _Certain insolvency law considerations."_

There is also a risk that the Collateral may be held invalid by a German court because the initial value of the
Collateral significantly exceeds the secured obligations (over-collateralization), including the liabilities under the Notes.
Under case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), security arrangements granting excessive
collateral may be invalid, if overall, in light of the motivation of the secured parties and the purpose of the collateral, the
taking of excessive collateral is not reconcilable with good faith standards. The German Federal Supreme Court has held
that collateral is excessive, if it can be expected at the time the relevant security arrangements are entered into, that the
value of the collateral will be in obvious disproportion (auffälliges Missverhältnis) to the amount of the secured obligations
at the time of enforcement. German courts have, however, not established specific numerical levels or ratios to determine
whether collateral is deemed to be excessive at the time the security arrangements are entered into. Furthermore, under
German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable
value of the security is significantly higher (exceeding 110 %) than the value of the obligations secured by such security.
A summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Collateral in respect of German law
is set out in Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations – Germany._


-----

The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the
obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits
and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we make
dividends. The payment of dividends by a Guarantor or by the party granting the security interests to the Issuer to service
our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to those Guarantors or
parties to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees or the Security Documents. In addition, the payment under the
Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior
corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders' resolutions and
board resolutions.

In addition, judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands,
Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Instead, as a pre-condition to enforcing a
U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will consider
involving a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the
process may require considerable time to complete. For all of the foregoing, an investment in the Notes involves unique
risks that may not apply or may apply differently in a differently structured bond offering. If any of these risks materialize,
your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the Notes may be materially adversely affected. See "Service
_of Process and Enforcement of Judgments" for more information._

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden_**
**_may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_**
**_payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, the Parent is incorporated under the laws of Belgium
and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England, Finland, Germany,
Norway and Sweden, as applicable. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated
in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden or another relevant jurisdiction. Such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater
uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance
that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer's and the Guarantors'
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation or any other relevant jurisdictions where proceedings are opened may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding.
The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's
law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in
those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability
issues, see "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations" with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence_**
**_of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control, as defined in the Indenture, the Issuer
would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts to, but excluding, the date
of repurchase, if any. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds
available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our
other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may result
in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Existing Senior Facilities and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if
the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash
to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then-existing financial
resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting
a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to allow us to purchase the Notes
or we may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is
not obtained, the Issuer may remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require
third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we


-----

would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default
under the Indenture, which, in turn, would constitute a default under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
other debt arrangements. See "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control."

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control. Except as described under "Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control," the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the_
Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or
similar transaction.

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the Issuer's assets and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make
an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, the Issuer may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described in "Description of the
_Notes—IPO Pushdown"), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indenture and the_
Intercreditor Agreement shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant notice), so that, among other
things, references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in "Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions")
(and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Entity (as defined in "Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown")
and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Entity would be released from its
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security
granted by it or any holding company of it.

Such modifications could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes
as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (the "New Notes"). If such
modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such deemed exchange would generally
be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be
required to recognize any gain or loss (although any such loss could be disallowed). Furthermore, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue
discount or with a greater amount of original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under "Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations") would be required to include the original issue_
discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the
determination of whether the New Notes are treated as "contingent payment debt instruments" as a result of the possibility
of additional payments, as further described under "Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations—Characterization of the Notes," would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should_
consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the
Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown.

It is also possible that the IPO Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued
with original issue discount, in addition to the stated cash interest on the Notes, U.S. Holders (as defined under "Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations") will generally be required to include the amounts_
representing the original issue discount in gross income on a constant yield basis in advance of receipt of the cash payments
to which such income is attributable. See "Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or other offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer may, at its option,_**
**_redeem the Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Notes, holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture
will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price equal to that paid pursuant to such


-----

purchase or tender offer (excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, you may be required to surrender the
Notes against your will at a price equivalent to the lowest price paid to tendering holders, including if such price is below
par, and may not receive the return you expected to receive on the Notes. See "Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption."_

**_The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law._**

If, as a result of certain changes in tax law in any relevant tax jurisdiction, the Issuer or any Guarantor would
become obligated to pay additional amounts in respect of the Notes, the Issuer will have the option (but not the obligation)
to redeem the outstanding Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem the
Notes in these circumstances. See "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—Redemption Upon Changes in
_Withholding Taxes" for further discussion of redemption of the Notes for tax reasons._

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if, at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receives two of the
following: (a) a rating of "Baa3" or higher from Moody's, (b) a rating of "BBB−" or higher from Fitch and/or (c) a rating
of "BBB−" or higher from S&P (each as defined herein) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing,
then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which such Notes cease to have such ratings, certain
covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status." If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be_
able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests
of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any
such rating will be maintained.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

The Notes will be new securities and currently there is no market for them. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. They are not, however, obliged to do so and may discontinue
market-making at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed
by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations.

As a result, we cannot assure you as to:

    - the development or liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities
has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The
liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities
and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be
subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the
Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not be listed or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

We intend to list and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, as long as the Notes
are outstanding. However, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be listed or remain listed. If we cannot list or maintain
the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain such listing, we may
cease to maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, provided that we will use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange. Although no assurance is made as to the
liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized stock exchange for


-----

high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or
another stock exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder's ability to resell
the Notes in the secondary market.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure
the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation
of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a
decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the
return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our
business is conducted primarily outside the United States. All of the directors, managers and/or executive officers of the
Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In addition, as all of the assets of the Issuer, the Guarantors
and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside the United States,
you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards,
rendered in civil and commercial matters with the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany,
Norway or Sweden. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and
Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such
jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany,
Norway or Sweden of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, England
and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway or Sweden would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in
an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see
"Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments."

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time. Changes in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to obtain future_**
**_financing and the value of the Notes._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors
that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be
subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. Credit rating agencies continually review
the ratings they have assigned to us and our debt instruments and no assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Additionally, an increase in our gross indebtedness in
connection with the Transactions could be viewed negatively by ratings agencies. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The interests of our ultimate principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes._**

The interests of our ultimate principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as
holders of the Notes. Our ultimate principal shareholders have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to
affect our legal and capital structure and our day to day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management
and to approve any other changes to our operations. For example, our ultimate principal shareholders could vote to cause
us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividend distributions, in each case, so long as
the Indenture, the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of our
principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties
or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our ultimate principal shareholders could also have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance
their equity investments although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes.


-----

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing_**
**_systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will not be
considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be
the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will
make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts that
hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants.
After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will not have any responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear
and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may_**
**_be sold._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes or the
Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction and,
unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws of a state of the United States
or other jurisdiction. See "Notice to Investors." We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes
or the Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so. It is the obligation of the holders of the Notes to ensure that their
purchase and any subsequent transfer of the Notes, as applicable, within the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. Any of these restrictions and requirements will limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes
and the Guarantees.

**_Trading in the clearing systems is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades which could result in amounts being held in
denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to such
Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum
denomination or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing system at the
relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive notes unless and until such time as its holding
satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.

**_The market value of the Notes may be adversely affected if additional notes are considered to have original issue_**
**_discount and are not distinguishable from the Notes._**

The Issuer may issue additional notes ("Additional Notes") as described under "Description of the Notes." These
Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes in some
cases, may be treated as a separate series for US federal income tax purposes. In such a case, the Additional Notes may be
considered to have original issue discount ("OID") for US federal income tax purposes which may adversely affect the
market value of the original Notes of such series.


-----

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the "TIA") and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the provisions of the TIA.
Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt
securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting
interests of the trustee. See "Description of the Notes."


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the aggregate gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be €400.0 million (assuming
the Notes are issued at par). On the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering to: (i) repay and cancel a portion
of the Existing Term Loan B in a principal amount equal to €200.0 million, (ii) repay in full amounts drawn under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, (iii) fund cash on our balance sheet for general corporate purposes and (iv) pay fees
and expenses in connection with the Transactions. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders
under the Existing Senior Facilities and thus, may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering upon repayment
thereof.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Offering. Actual
amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from our estimates of
outstanding amounts of existing indebtedness to be repaid on the Issue Date as a result of fluctuations in working capital
requirements as well as the difference between estimated and actual fees, expenses and commissions. For descriptions of
our current and anticipated indebtedness following the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, see "Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements" and "Capitalization."_

**Reconciled Financial Information**

The following reconciliation of our statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2020 between Dutch GAAP and the Reconciled Financial Information has been prepared by management to
aid in the understanding of our financial information on a more comparable basis with our financial information for
subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments to the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP to present the Reconciled Financial Information have been prepared on a basis that our
management believes is consistent in all material respects as the basis on which our consolidated financial information is
prepared in accordance with IFRS. However, the presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain
management assumptions and estimates, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the
Reconciled Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a
true picture of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in
accordance with IFRS for such period. For example, the Reconciled Financial Information has not retrospectively applied
the IFRS requirements for business combinations as of January 1, 2020. Additional information on the basis of preparation
of the Reconciled Financial Information is set out below.

    - The Reconciled Financial Information has been prepared based on the audited FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP.

    - Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements to conform to IFRS
presentation requirements. For further information, see "—Line Item Classification" below.

    - Adjustments have been made based on the IFRS adjustments made in 2021 and 2022. For further
information, see "—Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information" below.

The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial information for
subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance
with Dutch GAAP. See also "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance
_with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP."_

_Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information_

A. Goodwill

Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is
required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. The amortization for the period presented has
therefore been reversed within profit or loss. The impact is a reversal of €46.7 million amortization for the year ended
December 31, 2020 presented under depreciation and amortization expenses.


-----

B. Leases

At the date of transition to IFRS on January 1, 2021, we applied a single recognition and measurement approach
for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (twelve months or less). As we started accounting
under IFRS as of January 1, 2021 for our entities in the Netherlands, we did not have the IFRS 16 accounting tools in place
in 2020. In the Nordics (entities acquired in the context of our acquisition of Cramo), IFRS 16 accounting tools were in
place in 2020. As a result, for those countries where IFRS 16 accounting tools were not in place in 2020, we have made
estimations based on the actual lease expenses in 2020 and the Right of Use starting point at January 1, 2021. The total
impact on the profit and loss statement for the ended December 31, 2020 amounts to:

    - depreciation of right-of-use assets presented under depreciation and amortization expenses of €53.6
million were recognized in 2020;

    - lease expenses presented under material and services of €55.3 million were reversed in 2020;

    - lease liabilities interest expenses of €5.3 million presented under finance expense were recognized in
2020; and

    - the recognition of €0.3 million of revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020 which was presented under
revenue.

C. Trade and other receivables

The adoption of IFRS fundamentally changed our accounting for impairment losses for financial assets by
replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forward-looking expected credit loss ("ECL") approach.
IFRS requires us to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through
profit or loss and contract assets. We assessed the impact of the change on transition date of January 1, 2021 to be
recognized in the statement of profit or loss for 2020 which has led to a decrease in net impairment losses on financial
assets in an amount of €1.2 million.

D. Revenue

Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business are recognized on a net (agent) basis. The
application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of revenue on a gross (principal) basis and
accordingly an increase in revenue was recognized in the 2020 financial year. We adjusted this by an increase of revenue
of €8.5 million and an equivalent decrease in material and services. We also adjusted revenue by €0.3 million for revenue
of subleases of real estate in 2020. See "—B. Leases" above.

E. Deferred tax

The various transitional adjustments (leases, trade and other receivables) results in different temporary differences.
Deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction in income tax expense. The total
adjustment amounts to €0.3 million additional tax expenses in 2020.

F. Defined benefit obligations

Defined benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS19).
The pension expenses in 2020 related to defined benefit plans, which amounted to €0.8 million. This has been adjusted
under employee benefits expenses.

G. Statement of cash flows

Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as cash outflows from
financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities increased by €50.1 million and cash outflows from
financing activities increased by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Line Item Classification_

Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements for purposes of the 2020
comparative financial information presented in the FY 2021 Financial Statements. Certain of these line items have been
reclassified in this Offering Memorandum to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. The following tables set forth
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with the FY 2020

**MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set out in "Presentation_
_of Financial and Other Information" and the Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. This discussion includes_
_forward-looking statements that, although based on assumptions we consider reasonable, are subject to risks and_
_uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein._
_See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions_
_associated with these statements._

**Overview**

We are a leading rental equipment specialist in Europe. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental
company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, with strong market positions across our main markets, including the largest
market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden and the second largest market share in each of Germany and
Finland, in each case in terms of revenue in 2022. Our family-owned business started out of four garage boxes in the 1970s,
and, under five decades later, has expanded into an industry leader with an extensive network of 759 depots in 18 European
countries and a fleet of approximately 860,000 rental units as at June 30, 2023. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
we generated €1,524.9 million in revenue and €540.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA.

We serve customers in a variety of end-markets from civil engineering, industrial, construction and infrastructure
to events and warehousing. Our core product offering includes general and specialist rental equipment alongside
complementary products and services, enabling us to be a one-stop-shop for our customer base of both corporate clients
(business-to-business) and individuals including craftsmen and retail clients (business-to-consumer). Our generalist
division is mainly focused on the less cyclical 'fit-out, maintain and operate' market segments which use lighter equipment,
while our specialist division is tailored to reach niche markets, such as site preparation, sanitation and access control.

With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our
customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe,
for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such
as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and
construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and
equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside
the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand
recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from
HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens
and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer "do-it-yourself" ("DIY") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY
retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business
less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further
simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training
courses, project management and emergency assistance.

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions:

    - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the_**
twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland,_**
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our
revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which_**
generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023; and

    - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue_**
(representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

In addition, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8
"Operating Segments" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see "Presentation of
_Financial Information—Operating Segments."_


-----

We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group,
is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our
portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe
since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020.

We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist
rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our
products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and
local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each
depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally
stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our
hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure
allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements.

Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past
decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996,
we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through
international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such
as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we
acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our
geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In
addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality
offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs.

The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the
equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of
ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital
deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity
to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their
targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can
contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also
invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers'
industries.

**Presentation of Financial Information**

We first prepared annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and in accordance with Title
9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the year ended December 31, 2022. Until December 31, 2021, we prepared our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP. Accordingly, we prepared the FY2022 Financial
Statements in compliance with IFRS. In preparing the FY 2022 Financial Statements, our opening statement of financial
position was prepared as of January 1, 2021, the date of our transition to IFRS.

As Dutch GAAP differs in significant respects from IFRS, the adoption of IFRS greatly reduces the comparability
of the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared under IFRS with the FY2021 Financial Statements prepared in accordance
with Dutch GAAP and the FY2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See "—Certain
_Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS." In order to aid in the understanding of our financial information on a_
comparable basis in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," we
present our historical financial condition and results of operations as follows (unless otherwise indicated):

    - as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 (and comparative information for the six months ended
June 30, 2022), as derived from the HY2023 Interim Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34, the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial;

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as derived from the FY 2022 Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS;

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, as derived from the comparative financial information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared
in accordance with IFRS; and

    - as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, as derived from (i) the opening statement of financial
position as of January 1, 2021 included in note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with IFRS and (ii) unaudited Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December


-----

31, 2020 presented using the principles applied by the Company to restate its Dutch GAAP financial
statements in accordance with IFRS.

The Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared by management
to aid in the understanding of our financial information on a more comparable basis with our financial information for
subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments to the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP to present the Reconciled Financial Information have been prepared on a basis that our
management believes is consistent in all material respects as the basis on which our consolidated financial information is
prepared in accordance with IFRS. See "—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS" below. However, the
presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain management assumptions and estimates, has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the Reconciled Financial Information addresses a
hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a true picture of our results for the year ended
December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS for such period. For example,
the Reconciled Financial Information has not retrospectively applied the IFRS requirements for business combinations as
of January 1, 2020. The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial
information for subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See also "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—Our current financial statements are
_prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior financial statements prepared in accordance_
_with Dutch GAAP." For additional information and a management reconciliation of the Reconciled Financial Information_
for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared under Dutch GAAP, see "—Certain
_Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS" below._

Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences
between Dutch GAAP, IFRS and other generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect
the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments
of, IFRS may have on the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum, our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. You should read this discussion in conjunction with
the sections entitled "Presentation of Financial Information," "Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information," "Risk Factors" and the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in_
this Offering Memorandum.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our results of operations are primarily affected by factors that impact the equipment rental industry generally,
particularly cyclicality and economic conditions affecting the civil engineering, industry, construction and infrastructure
sectors, and our management of capital expenditures in response to changes in the cycle. Our results of operations are also
affected by the expansion of our rental network through acquisitions and the opening and closing of depots. Our results of
operations can also be impacted by seasonality and currency fluctuations in our principal markets. These factors are
described in greater detail below. For trends affecting our business and the markets in which we operate, see also "Risk
_Factors," "Industry Overview" and "Business."_

**_Economic Conditions_**

Demand for our products is dependent on the industries in which our customers operate, the general economy and
other factors. Many of the markets in which our customers operate are cyclical, with activity levels that tend to increase
during periods of economic growth and decline during economic downturns. Demand for our products is correlated to
conditions in these industries and in the general economy, including credit markets.

Conditions in the markets in which our customers operate have an impact on both the utilization rate of our
equipment and on prices. As demand increases, so do utilization rates, and we can then, subject to existing agreements with
customers, choose to allocate equipment to customers who are willing to pay higher prices. When demand decreases, so
do utilization rates, and we may reduce prices to preserve utilization levels. Demand can be affected by general economic
trends and cycles that can have an impact (positive or negative) over a longer period and by short-term factors, such as
seasonality, that affect the utilization rates and prices for a brief period. See "—Seasonality" below. In the past, we have
managed the impact of medium and long-term trends by optimizing our rental fleet utilization rate, developing specialist
activities focused on non-construction-related niche markets (such as the DIY market and the market for pumping
equipment), diversifying our customer base by investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction-related
customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction such as the fit-out, maintain and operation phases. We
seek to further manage such trends through adjustment of our investments in new equipment, increases or decreases in
sales of our equipment and the management of our depot network.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, our business operations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results differed by country depending on the severity of the government restrictions imposed and the severity of the


-----

pandemic. The decrease in our level of activity, in line with the decrease in market activity, was most notable in Italy,
Austria, Belgium and the United Kingdom, where strict lockdown measures were imposed. In particular, as the entire
events industry came to a halt, demand from the events end market sharply contracted. Conversely, the COVID-19
pandemic had a positive impact on certain aspects of our business, such as unit rentals and our DIY business. We deployed
a number of measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the Group, including lowering the planned levels of capital
expenditure and introducing a significant cost savings program. See also "—Operating Expenses" below. After a decrease
in demand in 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the equipment rental market rebounded in line with the construction
market, which benefitted from household savings, low interest rates and a relaunch of governmental construction projects.
As a result of the measures we implemented in response to the pandemic and the recovery in demand that followed, we
were able to generate positive Reported EBITDA of €432.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (based on the
Reconciled Financial Information), and we increased our sales across all of our geographic regions in the year ended
December 31, 2021, most notably in Northern Europe, driven by general economic growth and several large projects.

Since February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilized the financial and commodity markets and
resulted in an uncertain macroeconomic situation in Europe, causing inflation throughout the economy, to which central
banks have responded with rises in interest rates, and volatile energy prices. Although we have continued to experience
growth in revenue and Reported EBITDA, these macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for
rental services and, paired with other economic developments, impact our operating expenses and the cost of new
equipment we purchase for our rental fleet. In addition, we have historically had a shareholding in Fortrent, a 50% owned
joint venture with Ramirent Oyj with operations in Russia, which was accounted for in our consolidated financial statements
under the equity method. Considering the level of uncertainty due to the geopolitical situation resulting from the war in
Ukraine and the high volatility of the Russian ruble, we fully impaired our investment in Fortrent in the year ended
December 31, 2022, which included the write-down of the full amount of the carrying value of our investment in Fortrent
amounting to €10.9 million, the depreciation of certain receivables amounting to €0.9 million and the reversal of the net
result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €2.6 million for the period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reversed
the net result of Fortrent amounting to a gain of €1.1 million for the period. In June 2022, we, together with our joint
venture partner, decided to sell Fortrent. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our interest in Fortrent continues to
be held for sale.

Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased our
revenue and Reported EBITDA by 11.6% and 10.8%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,
demonstrating the resilience of our business model. In this period, each of our geographic regions experienced strong
performance, with revenue generated by the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe and Other Countries (primarily
Italy and the United Kingdom) regions increasing by 17.8%, 9.9%, 9.8% and 8.7%, respectively, compared to the prior
year. In addition, while the inflationary environment resulted in an increase in our operating expenses during the year,
particularly repair and maintenance expenses, transportation expenses and housing expenses, we were able to preserve our
margins through our ability to increase prices and generate operational efficiencies.

**_Acquisitions, Geographic Expansion and Depot Openings_**

We have historically expanded our operations through acquisitions as well as organic growth depot openings. The
following table sets forth certain information on our depot network for the periods indicated.

depots, nine depots and one depot, respectively, in the six month ended June 30, 2023.

From time to time, we acquire providers of rental fleets and specialist products and services that complement our
current offering to broaden the range of our rental products and services and increase our presence in existing and new


-----

markets, which impacts our financial performance. Through our strategic acquisitions, we believe we have historically
been able to increase our capacity and make available to our customers a more expansive and comprehensive range of
rental products and services. Our significant acquisitions since January 1, 2020 include:

    - In 2020, we acquired all shares of Cramo Plc, a company listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange,
pursuant to a recommended voluntary public cash tender offer, with 93.04% of the shares acquired in
February 2020, and a redemption process and squeeze out procedure to reclaim the remaining outstanding
shares held by third parties in June 2020. The delisted company, Cramo Oy ("Cramo") has been
consolidated in our financial statements since February 1, 2020 and contributed €514 million and €125
million to our revenue and Reported EBITDA between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020,
respectively, on a Dutch GAAP basis. See "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of
_Operations—Acquisition of Cramo" below._

    - On January 21, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Eekels Pompen B.V. and Eekels Materieelbeheer
B.V. (together, "Eekels Pompen"). Eekels Pompen has offered professional pump rental solutions and
temporary pump systems for more than 100 years and as such fits seamlessly into our strategy of growth
in specialist niche rental activities. With a fleet of over 1,000 pumps and pipes and hoses, Eekels Pompen
supports the public sector, industry, marine and offshore, and civil engineering throughout the
Netherlands (with three branches) and Belgium. Eekels Pompen employs approximately 50 people.

    - On April 28, 2023, our subsidiary, Cramo AB, acquired the assets and business of Hyresbutiken AB
("Hyresbutiken"), a local rental company in Skellefteå in northern Sweden.

    - On May 2, 2023, we acquired the assets of Safelift GmbH ("Safelift"), a specialist lifting and hoisting
rental company in Germany.

    - On May 10, 2023, our subsidiary, Boels Rental Ltd., acquired Illumin8 Lights Ltd ("Illumin8 Lights"),
a lighting tower specialist based in Essex, United Kingdom. The company provides site lighting solutions
throughout the UK and is particularly strong in the events sector.

    - On May 12, 2023, our subsidiary, Cramo AS, acquired the shares of BAS Maskinutleie AS ("BAS
**Maskinutleie"), a Norwegian rental company. Established in 2008 as part of Backe, BAS Maskinutleie**
serves the construction market from eight geographically spread locations.

    - On May 15, 2023, our subsidiary, Cramo AB, completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of KraftX
AB ("KraftX"). KraftX is a leading provider in Sweden for power generators and emergency power
supply. The company offers customers full-service power provision, from designing of the required
power solution, rental and installation, through to support during the rental period. From its nine outlets
across Sweden, KraftX serves customers in the construction, infrastructure and energy industries.

Acquisitions impact our financial position and results of operations in a variety of ways. We incur costs related to
the acquisition of the business, including the purchase price of the acquired business and the costs of integrating the
acquired business, including any costs related to the generation of synergies. We take a conservative valuation approach
and typically aim to pay EBITDA multiples of less than 4.5x for bolt-on acquisitions. Acquisitions may result in the
addition of new depots and the closure of existing ones as we seek to optimize our fleet management and streamline our
operations, which can impact on our sales from one period to the next. In addition, acquisitions can impact the comparability
of our results between periods as our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place include the results of
the acquired business only from the date of completion of the acquisition and the full impact of the acquired business is
only reflected in subsequent periods. See "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Acquisition
_of Cramo" below._

In addition to expanding through acquisitions, we have also grown organically during the period under review by
opening greenfield depots, which in turn, contribute to our sales. Along with acquired depots, greenfield depot openings
enable us to continue to strategically expand our depot network to ensure geographic coverage for our customer base and
serve additional customer demand. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we added 19 greenfield depots and 23
greenfield depots, respectively, which contributed to our sales growth over those periods, particularly in our general rental
business. Between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2023, after the integration of Cramo Central Europe, we estimate that
more than 90% of our revenue growth has been organic.


-----

**_Capital Expenditures, Fleet Age and Equipment Disposals_**

The management of our level of capital expenditure by increasing or decreasing the amount of investment in our
fleet is an important factor in our results of operations and cash flow. Decisions about investment in new equipment are
based on the condition and remaining useful life of our existing equipment as well as on our views of future demand,
legislative developments and the industry transition towards higher sustainability standards. During growth cycles, we may
decide to invest in our fleet by replacing aging equipment or equipment at the end of its useful economic life and by
expanding the total size of the fleet, which in turn also reduces the average age of the fleet. In downturns we have the ability
to limit capital expenditures to the replacement equipment at the end of its useful economic life and let the average age of
the fleet slowly increase in order to conserve cash. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Capital Expenditure
(excluding acquisitions) amounted to €356.0 million and €533.4 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31,
2020, our Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) amounted to €206.5 million on a Dutch GAAP basis, with no
adjustments to this figure in the Reconciled Financial Information. In addition, we benefit from a well-invested fleet of
rental equipment with an average fleet age significantly below the average useful life, which enables us to control our
maintenance capital expenditure levels. As a proxy, we target annual maintenance capital expenditure of approximately
10% of our total fleet purchase value, less income generated from the sale of used equipment. Our Capital Expenditure
(excluding acquisitions) during the period under review related primarily to growth in activity, greenfield depot openings
and the development of a diversified, sustainable fleet in order to position us to capitalize on growth opportunities.

In the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, investments in our fleet increased
the number of serialized rental items by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, reflecting a broadening of our existing
assortment and our continued investment in the Eco-label fleet. These investments resulted in a decrease in the weighted
average fleet age from 55 months in 2021, to 54 months in 2022 and 53 months as of June 30, 2023.

We determine the allocation of investments in our rental fleet by the type of equipment and the requirements of
our business units. We divide our equipment into several subgroups, which enables us to analyze the best strategic
deployment, combined with the best possible use for customers, the lowest downtime and the most efficient economies of
scale. As of June 30, 2023, our rental units were comprised of approximately 39% tools, 27% energy and climate, 13%
material handling, 11% site huts and site preparation, 5% earthmoving and 4% access equipment.

We continue to invest in our fleet to remain on top of market developments and play a leading role in the energy
transition within the equipment rental sector, with a substantial amount of our planned capital expenditure to be invested
in our Eco-label and zero-emission fleet. Of our total energy powered fleet, approximately 81% is electric as of June 30,
2023 and we aim to increase this percentage to 85% by 2025. Our aim is to be the frontrunner in investing in innovative
solutions to increase the sustainability of our fleet.

In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of assets in our fleet. In a typical year, we target selling assets in
our fleet with a resale value of between €50 million and €60 million and realizing a profit margin compared to book value
of between 40% and 50% depending on market conditions. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 3.4% of
our revenue from the sale of assets in our fleet. We sell assets in our fleet when we believe that these assets have reached
the end of their useful life because they have become obsolete or when the cost of maintaining them in proper condition
for customer use is too high. We may also sell assets in our fleet before the end of their useful life if we believe a decline
in demand in a given market is likely to last for a significant period of time or if otherwise economical to do so. For instance,
in 2022, the market for used equipment showed a high level of volatility and, as a result, we decided to resell certain
categories of equipment and purchase new and more sustainable substitute equipment.

The following table sets forth certain information on our fleet for the periods indicated.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Our business, like that of all equipment rental groups, is capital-intensive with a predominantly fixed cost structure
that principally relates to the depreciation of our equipment fleet, operating expenses (such as personnel charges) that are


-----

relatively fixed for short or long periods of time, and to a lesser extent, real estate lease expenses. Some of our operating
expenses, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets (which are linked to real estate lease payments) and personnel charges
in certain countries, may be linked to indices, including consumer price indices, which may increase due to inflation.

The management of our costs is an important factor in our results of operations and cash flows. With our
centralized fleet ownership model, we seek to deploy our fleet efficiently across our network to respond to actual or
anticipated increases and decreases in demand rather than renting additional equipment from third parties to then rent it out
to our customers or duplicating investments in the same piece of equipment in different geographies, which could eventually
lead to over-capacity. We also monitor our costs and margins on a regular basis. For example, when faced with more
challenging market conditions in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a significant cost savings
program, which included cutting certain fixed costs, such as staff costs through utilizing temporary contracts to increase
the flexibility of our workforce during the period, as well as rationalizing our investment program on our fleet to focus on
added value. In addition, we use temporary staffing from local employment agencies and contractor agencies where
additional resources are needed for specific projects or to fill a vacant position in the short term, which enables us to
maintain flexibility in our staff costs. For example, from March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
we reduced our usage of temporary staff to manage our costs. Following the recovery in market activity in 2021, we
increased our usage of temporary staff, which, together with higher hourly rates reflecting labor market shortages and the
inflationary environment, resulted in an increase in our temporary staffing costs. This increase is reflected in our employee
benefits expense in our statement of profit or loss.

**_Seasonality_**

Our operations experience a degree of seasonality in the first quarter of each year, driven principally by climatic
conditions in our different regions of operations. For example, in certain regions in which we operate, demand in the
construction and civil engineering markets tends to decrease in winter and during extended periods of inclement weather
while increasing in the summer and during extended periods of mild weather. However, the seasonality impact on our
results of operations is relatively small given regional variations in the response to working practices in connection with
weather, as some regions experience little to no change in operational activity despite weather variations.

**_Currency Fluctuations_**

The majority of our revenue (66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022), expenses and obligations are
denominated in euro. However, our results of operations are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as we generate
revenue and incur expenses in a variety of currencies other than our reporting currency, the euro, primarily the Swedish
krona, the Norwegian krone, the Danish krone, the British pound, the Polish zloty, Swiss franc and the Czech koruna. We
also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are exposed to currency translation risk. We use forward exchange
contracts to hedge some of our currency risks, mainly related to our cash flows in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom,
Poland and the Czech Republic. However, we cannot eliminate all of our currency risks, and any significant or prolonged
adverse movements in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our profitability, cash flows and financial position.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with a nominal value of
€383.0 million and €250.3 million, respectively, and a positive market value of €2.5 million and €2.4 million, respectively.
The effectiveness of our hedging strategy depends on various factors, such as the accuracy of our forecasts, the availability
and cost of hedging instruments, and the volatility of the currency markets. We monitor our currency exposure and hedge
ratios on a regular basis and adjust our hedging activities as appropriate.

**_Interest Rate Fluctuations_**

Our financial expenses are affected by the movement of interest rates, particularly EURIBOR, which is the
reference rate for most of our floating rate borrowings. Our policy is to hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by entering
into interest rate swaps, which effectively convert some of our floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities. However,
we are not fully hedged and we remain exposed to changes in interest rates on our unhedged borrowings and on the fair
value of our interest rate swaps. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 69% of the outstanding
principal amount of our Existing Term Loan B was hedged through February 2028 with €1,000 million in notional amount
of interest rate swaps. Pursuant to such interest rate swaps, the fixed interest rate at which EURIBOR has been swapped is
0.44% until February 2026, 2.84% between February 2026 and February 2027, and 2.68% between February 2027 and
February 2028. See also "—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks—Market Risks—Interest rate
_risk."_

In the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, we experienced an increase in
financial expenses due to the rise in EURIBOR. This resulted in higher interest payments on our unhedged floating rate
borrowings. We monitor the interest rate environment and the effectiveness of our hedging strategy on a regular basis and
may adjust our hedging position as appropriate to achieve our desired risk profile. We also consider the availability and


-----

cost of alternative sources of financing and the maturity profile of our debt portfolio to optimize our capital structure and
liquidity position.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations**

The following are certain factors that have affected, and may continue to affect, the comparability of our results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity in the periods discussed in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Application of IFRS_**

We first prepared annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and in accordance with Title
9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the year ended December 31, 2022. Until December 31, 2021, we prepared our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP. As Dutch GAAP differs in significant respects from
IFRS, the adoption of IFRS greatly reduces the comparability of the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared under IFRS
with the FY 2021 Financial Statements and the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared under Dutch GAAP. For a
discussion of the presentation of financial information in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations," see "—Presentation of Financial Information." For a discussion of certain_
differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS as applied by us, see "—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS."
Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between
Dutch GAAP, IFRS and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect
the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments
of, IFRS may have on the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum, our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. See also "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—Our current
_financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior financial statements_
_prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP."_

**_Acquisition of Cramo_**

The historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is affected by the acquisition of
Cramo in 2020, which may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate the historical performance of our business.

On November 11, 2019, we entered into a combination agreement with Cramo, pursuant to which we made a
voluntary recommended public cash tender offer to purchase the outstanding shares in Cramo. Pursuant to the tender offer,
on February 5, 2020, we acquired approximately 93.04% of the issued and outstanding shares in Cramo. For practical
reasons, we consolidated Cramo in our financial statements as of February 1, 2020. Pursuant to a subsequent redemption
process and squeeze-out procedure, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares in Cramo on June 3, 2020.

Our audited consolidated financial statements and the financial information presented in this Offering
Memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect the results of Cramo for the period from February 1,
2020 to December 31, 2020 only. Cramo contributed €514 million and €125 million to our revenue and Reported EBITDA
between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively, on a Dutch GAAP basis. Our audited consolidated
financial statements and the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 do not include the results of Cramo for the period from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2020. As a
result, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the year ended December 31, 2020 is not fully
comparable to the financial information presented for subsequent periods.

The acquisition of Cramo had a significant impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the
costs associated with the acquisition and financing of Cramo and several one-off costs related to restructuring measures
and the integration of the Cramo business. Capital expenditure related to the acquisition of Cramo comprised 74% of our
Gross Capital Expenditure in the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisition of Cramo was financed by a senior credit
facility (which was subsequently refinanced), resulting in an increase in our net interest bearing liabilities and an increase
in our interest expense.

**Explanation of Key Line Items from the Statement of Profit or Loss**

The following is a summary description of certain line items from our statement of profit or loss presented in
IFRS. For more information see "—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and the notes to our consolidated audited
financial statements.

_Revenue_ is comprised of revenue from equipment rental, which reflects the fees paid by customers to rent
equipment, and revenue from sales of goods and other services, which reflects the sale of rental equipment at the end of its
useful economic life and the sale of certain items associated with the use of rental equipment and fees paid by customers
for additional services relating to equipment rental. In the six months ended June 30, 2023 and in the year ended December


-----

31, 2022, revenue from equipment rental represented 69% and 71% of our total revenue, respectively, and revenue from
sales of goods and other services represented 31% and 29% of our total revenue, respectively.

_Materials and services principally includes cost of rental and rental-sharing, cost of goods sold, repair and_
maintenance cost, logistics cost, property cost, office cost, marketing and sales cost and other external costs

_Employee benefits expense relates primarily to the salaries, social security charges, pension charges and other_
personnel costs for our employees.

_Depreciation and amortization expense principally includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment (fleet_
and non-fleet). Depreciation and amortization also includes depreciation of intangible assets (trademarks and customer
relationships). Under IFRS 16, as a lessee, we account for right-of-use assets associated with leases and recognize
amortization in respect thereof on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_Net impairment losses on financial assets includes losses on bad debts, net of change in provisions on current_
assets.

_Other operating expenses represents the impairment of investments in joint ventures, which in the year ended_
December 31, 2022 reflected our impairment of our investment in Fortrent.

_Financial income primarily includes interest income on cash balances._

_Financial expense comprises interest charges on bank loans and hedging expenses. It also includes changes in the_
fair value of derivatives instruments and the interest cost related to the lease liability generated by the application of the
IFRS 16 standard.

_Income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes calculated in accordance with the relevant tax laws in_
force in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As of June 30, 2023, the statutory corporate tax rate in the Netherlands was
25.8%. We are also subject to tax rates in the other countries in which we operate.

_Share of profit of joint venture represents results from our investments in associates and joint ventures, which are_
accounted for under the equity method, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5.

**_Six months ended June 30, 2023 (IFRS) compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 (IFRS)_**

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by 7.8% to €758.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €703.0
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to strong performance across all of our key geographic
markets, as discussed further below. Additionally, we experienced organic growth as a result of the expansion of our depot
network by six new locations, bringing the total to 759 as of June 30, 2023. Growth from acquisitions in the period included
the acquisitions of BAS Maskinutleie, KraftX and Illumin8 Lights as well as the acquisition of the assets of Hyresbutiken


-----

and Safelift, which, together, added 20 depots to our network. Out of the total revenue increase of 7.8% during the period,
we estimate that approximately 6.7% of the total was derived from organic growth.

Revenue generated by the Netherlands region increased by 14.1% to €183.5 million in the six months ended June
30, 2023, from €160.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to significant growth in both our
specialist and general rental product portfolios and the increasing demand in the industrial end market.

Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 10.0% to €269.5 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2023, from €244.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to strong performance in the
general rental product portfolio in Germany and the Czech Republic, with modest growth in Belgium, Austria and
Luxembourg.

Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 2.7% to €281.8 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2023, from €274.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to organic growth in most
countries within the region as well as the acquisitions of BAS Maskinutleie in Norway and Hyresbutiken and KraftX in
Sweden, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate of each of the Swedish krona and the Norwegian
krone against the euro.

Revenue generated by the Other Countries region slightly increased by 1.3% to €23.3 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2023, from €23.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to organic growth, as well
as the acquisition of Illumin8 Lights in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the exchange
rate of the British pound against the euro.

_Operating Expenses_

Materials and Services

Materials and services expenses increased by 4.0% to €269.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to €259.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increase in
logistics costs, mainly attributable to the sales growth during the period, as well as higher prices for fuel, parts and services.

Employee Benefits Expense

Employee benefits expense increased by 12.1% to €222.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to €198.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the
average number of employees to 7,058 full time equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2023, from 6,692 full time
equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as well as growth in wages and salaries which were increased as a
result of the inflationary environment over the period. In addition, we incurred higher expenses for temporary staff in the
six months ended June 30, 2023 due to an increase in the number of temporary staff and higher hourly rates for such
temporary staff.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 6.4% to €171.0 million in the six months ended June 30,
2023, compared to €160.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the significant increase of capital
expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting investments in
our rental fleet and acquisitions. See "—Capital Expenditures" below.

Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets

Net impairment losses on financial assets decreased by 21.4% to €1.1 million in the six months ended June 30,
2023, compared to €1.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to improved aging of outstanding
receivables, which reduced loss allowances of trade and other receivables.

_Financial Income and Expense_

Our net financial expense increased significantly from a net expense of €30.2 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to a net expense of €43.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in
interest expense in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in EURIBOR, which impacted the rate at
which interest accrued on our unhedged floating-rate indebtedness, and an increase in our gross indebtedness over the
period. We benefitted from the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging policy, which partially mitigated the impact of the
increase in EURIBOR over the period.


-----

_Income Tax Expense_

Our income tax expense increased to €14.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to €5.8
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for carry forward
losses from previous years in Germany and Finland in 2022, which we partially allocated to the six months ended June 30,
2022.

_Profit for the period_

As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €39.7 million in the six months ended June 30,
2023, a decrease of 21.7%, compared to a profit of €50.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022.

**_Year ended December 31, 2022 (IFRS) compared to year ended December 31, 2021 (IFRS)_**

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by 11.6% to €1,469.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €1,317.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strong performance across all of our key markets and an
increase in prices, as discussed further below. The vast majority of our revenue growth in 2022 was organic as a result of
the expansion of our depot network by 19 new locations, bringing the total to 743 as of December 31, 2022. Growth from
acquisitions in the period was limited to the acquisition of Eekels Pompen in the year ended December 31, 2022, which
also added three depots to our network.

Revenue generated by the Netherlands region increased by 17.8% to €340.2 million in the year ended December
31, 2022, from €288.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in sales from our general
rental activities, strong growth in sales from specialist rental activities (including from the acquisition of Eekels Pompen),
as well as an increase in sales to the industrial end market.

Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 9.9% to €514.3 million in the year ended December
31, 2022, from €467.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to sales growth across all countries
within the region, with notable growth in Eastern European markets, while Belgium and Luxembourg showed stable
performance under tougher economic circumstances during the year.

Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 9.8% to €569.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022, from €518.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strong performance and
growth in sales across all countries in the region, supported by investment in our fleet in both years. Sweden and Finland,
our two largest markets within the region, experienced notable growth, with Sweden particularly supported by large
industrial projects. Despite the uncertainty and geopolitical developments in the region, the Baltic countries showed the
strongest growth in the Northern Europe region. In addition, Norway experienced significant growth in sales compared to
the prior year, despite a stronger competitive environment.

Revenue generated by the Other Countries region increased by 8.7% to €46.1 million in the year ended December
31, 2022, from €42.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by strong economic conditions in the
construction industry in the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively, in 2022, following the market recovery in 2021 after
the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Operating Expenses_

Materials and Services

Materials and services expenses increased by 12.1%, in line with the increase in sales during the year, to €535.5
million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €477.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This
increase was primarily due to the increase in logistics costs, mainly attributed to the sales growth during the year, as well
as higher prices for fuel, parts and services and certain rental related services.

Employee Benefits Expense

Employee benefits expense increased by 12.3%, in line with the increase in sales during the year, to €410.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €365.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees to 6,515 full time equivalents for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from 6,329 full time equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2021, to support the growth of our
business and annual salary increases driven by inflation during the year.


-----

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 7.7% to €326.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to €303.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the significant increase of capital
expenditures in tangible and intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in increased
depreciation of property, plant and equipment. See "—Capital Expenditures" below.

Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets

Net impairment losses on financial assets increased by 15.6% to €3.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2022, compared to €3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in activities and sales,
resulting in an increase in expected credit losses.

Other Operating Expenses

We recognized other operating expenses of €11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to nil
in the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the write-down of our investment in Fortrent. See "—Key Factors Affecting
_Results of Operations—Economic Conditions" for additional information._

_Financial Income and Expense_

Our net financial expense increased from a net expense of €70.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to
a net expense of €71.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest expense in
2022 as a result of an increase in EURIBOR, which impacted the rate at which interest accrued on our floating-rate
indebtedness, and an increase in our gross indebtedness compared to 2021. This increase was partially offset by the
repricing of our Existing Term Loan B in June 2021, which resulted in lower interest rate margins in the second half of
2021. We also benefitted from the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging policy, which partially mitigated the impact of
the increase in EURIBOR over the period.

_Income Tax Expense_

Our income tax expense decreased by 32.4% to €14.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to
€21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not
recognized for carry forward losses from previous years in Germany and Finland in the year ended December 31, 2022,
partially offset by an increase in current tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Share of Profit of Joint Venture_

Our share of profit of joint venture was nil in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €1.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our decision to classify our investment in the Fortrent joint venture as assets
held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2022. See "—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Economic
_Conditions" for additional information._

_Profit for the year_

As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €100.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2022, an increase of 25.3% compared to a profit of €80.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Year ended December 31, 2021 (IFRS) compared to year ended December 31, 2020 (Reconciled Financial Information)_**

The following discussion presents a comparison of our statement of profit or loss for the year ended December
31, 2021 on an IFRS basis and our statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 based on the Reconciled
Financial Information. The presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain management
assumptions and estimates, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the Reconciled
Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a true picture
of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in accordance with
IFRS for such period. The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial
information for subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See "—Presentation of Financial Information" and "Risk Factors—Financial
_Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior_
_financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP." For additional information and a management_
reconciliation of the Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared under Dutch GAAP, see "—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS" below.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by 11.3% to €1,317.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €1,184.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in volumes due to the strong recovery from the
pandemic in our key markets and the full-year contribution of Cramo, which was consolidated for the full year of 2021,
while in 2020 only 11 months of Cramo's revenue was consolidated. See "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our
_Results of Operations—Acquisition of Cramo." Excluding the acquisition of Cramo, the remainder of our revenue growth_
was primarily organic.

Revenue generated by the Netherlands region increased by 2.1% to €288.8 million in the year ended December
31, 2021, from €282.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in general rental activity,
partially offset by a decrease in activities related to the industrial and chemical and petrochemical industry end markets.

Revenue generated by the Central Europe region increased by 6.4% to €467.9 million in the year ended December
31, 2021, from €439.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a recovery of activity in certain
Eastern European markets in 2021, which had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the full-year
contribution of Cramo in Central Europe in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020). This increase was partially offset by
the termination of certain non-core business activities in June 2020 relating to Cramo Germany's sale of new equipment.

Revenue generated by the Northern Europe region increased by 21.3% to €518.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €427.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in demand for
rental services driven by an improvement in general economic conditions, increased demand linked to several large projects
in Sweden and the full-year contribution of Cramo in Northern Europe in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020).

Revenue generated by the Other Countries region increased by 23.6% to €42.4 million in the year ended December
31, 2021, from €34.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a strong recovery in sales in Italy and
the United Kingdom, which had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

_Operating Expenses_

Materials and Services

Materials and services expenses increased by 18.0% to €477.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €404.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased level of activity in 2021
compared to 2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition in
2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020).

Employee Benefits Expense

Employee benefits expense increased by 5.8% to €365.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared
to €345.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition in
2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020) and a significant increase in temporary staff expenses in 2021 compared to 2020,
which had been curtailed from March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.5% to €303.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €298.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the full-year effect of the Cramo
acquisition in 2021 (compared to 11 months in 2020) and increased level of investment activities in the course of 2021.

Net Impairment Losses on Financial Assets

Net impairment losses on financial assets decreased by 44% to €3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to provisions recognized
in 2020 relating to outstanding receivables of certain Cramo entities acquired in 2020, as well as the improved economic
environment in 2021, compared to 2020 which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Financial Income and Expense_

Our net financial expense decreased from a net expense of €97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to
a net expense of €70.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to certain fees and expenses related to
the refinancing of indebtedness incurred to finance the Cramo acquisition and the successful amendment and repricing of
the Existing Term Loan B in June 2021.


-----

_Income Tax Expense_

Our income tax expense decreased slightly to €21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to
€22.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, while the result before tax increased significantly. This is primarily
due to the recognition in 2021 of certain deferred tax assets for carry forward losses and (non-deductible) interest expense
from 2020.

_Share of Profit of Joint Venture_

Our share of profit of joint venture was stable over the period, amounting to €1.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 and €1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Profit/(loss) for the year_

As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a profit of €80.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, compared to a profit of €15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**EBITDA**

For detail on our definition of Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see "Summary Consolidated Financial
_and Other Information—Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As Adjusted Financial Information" and "Presentation of_
_Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures."_

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our debt facilities,
including the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and our Trade Receivables Purchase Program, and we may from time to
time issue debt securities. Our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect will continue to be, operating expenses,
capital expenditures, working capital requirements, acquisitions and debt service payments. As of June 30, 2023, our cash
and cash equivalents amounted to €1.1 million.

We currently have, and following the completion of the Transactions, will continue to have, substantial
indebtedness. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements." As adjusted for the Transactions, as of June 30, 2023,
we would have had outstanding €1,906.6 million of total net debt. See "Capitalization." Our indebtedness levels may have
important negative consequences for noteholders. See "Risk Factors." There are also limitations on our ability to obtain
additional debt financing. See "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness." Further, any
additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments on our then
existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby.

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our obligations under
the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash,
which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, as well as other
factors discussed in "Risk Factors," many of which are beyond our control.

We believe that, based on our current level of operations, our cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities
and the availability of borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Trade Receivables Purchase
Program will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service payments for at least the
next twelve months.

**Cash Flows Data**

The following is a discussion of our cash flows from operating activities, cash flows (used in)/from investing
activities and cash flows (used in)/from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for
the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023.

The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated.

Note: The Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared by management to aid in the understanding
of our financial information on a more comparable basis with our financial information for subsequent periods prepared in accordance with
IFRS. The Reconciled Financial Information has not been audited and is not fully comparable with our financial information for subsequent
periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our audited FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP.
The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been derived from the comparative financial information for the year
ended December 31, 2021 included in the FY 2022 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. See "—Presentation of Financial
_Information," "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Application of IFRS" and "—Certain Differences Between_
_Dutch GAAP and IFRS."_

**_Six months ended June 30, 2023 (IFRS) compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 (IFRS)_**

_Net cash from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities decreased by 43.8% to €128.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to €228.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to a significant increase in changes in
working capital, from an impact of negative €3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to an impact of negative
€115.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a large delivery of new fleet in
the fourth quarter of 2022, for which payment was made in the six months ended June 30, 2023.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by 26.8% to €285.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to €225.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in investments in our rental
fleet and other assets and acquisitions. Gross Capital Expenditure increased to €289.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2023, from €225.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, of which cash used for acquisitions amounted
to €52.7 million and €16.6 million, respectively.

_Net cash (used in)/from financing activities_

Net cash (used in)/from financing activities amounted to an inflow of €141.5 million in the six months ended June
30, 2023, compared to an outflow of €29.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in
the use of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, of which €131.6 million was drawn as of June 30, 2023, in combination
with the use of the Trade Receivables Purchase Program, established in June 2023, in an amount of €48.1 million. This
was partially offset by a €13.0 million distribution of dividends to the Parent in March 2023, of which €6.8 million was
paid in cash and the remainder was settled with outstanding receivables from related parties.

**_Year ended December 31, 2022 (IFRS) compared to year ended December 31, 2021 (IFRS)_**

_Net cash from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities increased by 24.6% to €572.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to €459.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in activity and revenue and a
resulting increase in profit from ordinary operations. Changes in working capital increased from an impact of positive €26.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to an impact of positive €84.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, primarily due to the high level of capital expenditure incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was only paid in
2023.


-----

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by 56.0% to €551.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to €353.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in investments in our rental
fleet and other assets, in line with a strong market demand and as a consequence of delays resulting from certain supply
chain constraints in 2021 and the acquisition of a number of smaller specialist rental companies, such as Eekels Pompen.
Gross Capital Expenditure increased to €551.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from €356.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021, of which cash used for acquisitions amounted to €17.8 million and nil, respectively.

_Net cash used in financing activities_

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 66.3% to €65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to €194.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the repricing of our syndicated debt
facilities in 2021, which included a full repayment of a €238 million Term Loan A and an increase in the notional amount
of the Existing Term Loan B by €115 million.

**_Year ended December 31, 2021 (IFRS) compared to year ended December 31, 2020 (Reconciled Financial Information)_**

The following discussion presents a comparison of our statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2021 on an IFRS basis and our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 based on the
Reconciled Financial Information. The presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain
management assumptions and estimates, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the
Reconciled Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a
true picture of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in
accordance with IFRS for such period. The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with
our financial information for subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. See "—Presentation of Financial Information" and "Risk Factors—
_Financial Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with_
_our prior financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP." For additional information and a management_
reconciliation of the Reconciled Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared under Dutch GAAP, see "—Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS" below.

_Net cash from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities increased by 29.1% to €459.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €355.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in activities and revenue and
resulting increase in the profit from ordinary operations in 2021 and the full-year effect of the Cramo acquisition. Changes
in working capital increased from an impact of negative €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an impact
of positive €26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in activity and investments
in 2021 compared to 2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 56.6% to €353.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €814.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Cramo acquisition in 2020, partially
offset by an increase in capital expenditures in 2021 due to the strong recovery in demand following the COVID-19
pandemic. Gross Capital Expenditure decreased to €356.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €818.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2020, of which cash used for acquisitions amounted to nil and €611.6 million,
respectively.

_Net cash (used in)/from financing activities_

Net cash (used in)/from financing activities amounted to an outflow of €194.8 million in the year ended December
31, 2021, compared to inflow of €608.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the refinancing of our
Existing Term Loan B, which related to the Cramo acquisition, partially offset by repayment of existing debt, consisting
of bank financing and euro-denominated assignable loans (Schuldscheindarlehen).

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures consist principally of investments in fixed assets (in particular, our equipment fleet). We
determine and allocate our budget for capital expenditures on an annual basis and update it on a regular basis throughout
the year based on market developments. Decisions about investment in new equipment are based on the condition and
remaining useful life of our existing equipment as well as on our views of future demand, legislative developments and the


-----

industry transition towards higher sustainability standards. During growth cycles, we may decide to invest in our fleet by
replacing aging equipment or equipment at the end of its useful economic life and by expanding the total size of the fleet,
while in downturns, we have the ability to limit capital expenditures to the replacement of equipment at the end of its useful
economic life in order to conserve cash. See also "—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures,
_Fleet Age and Equipment Disposals."_

We define Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) as purchases of property, plant and equipment plus
purchases of intangible assets shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows and Gross Capital Expenditure as Capital
Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) plus acquisitions shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows. However, other
companies may present Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and Gross Capital Expenditure differently than we
do. We present Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and Gross Capital Expenditure as additional information
because we believe it is helpful to investors in highlighting trends in our business. Capital Expenditure (excluding
acquisitions) and Gross Capital Expenditure are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered as an alternative to measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial
_Information—Non-IFRS Measures" for additional information._

The table below sets forth certain information on our capital expenditure for the periods indicated.

_Dutch GAAP and IFRS."_

Our Gross Capital Expenditure for the six months ended June 30, 2023 amounted to €289.1 million, of which
€236.4 million was from Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and €52.7 million related to acquisitions. Gross
Capital Expenditures in the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily reflected investments in our rental fleet and the
acquisitions of BAS Maskinutleie, KraftX and Illumin8 Lights as well as the acquisition of the assets of Hyresbutiken in
the six months ended June 30, 2023. See "—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures, Fleet Age
_and Equipment Disposals" for additional information._

Our Gross Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €551.2 million, of which
€533.4 million was from Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and €17.8 million related to acquisitions. Gross
Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily reflected increased investments in our rental fleet and
other assets and the acquisition of Eekels Pompen.

Our Gross Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to €356.0 million, all of which
was from Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions). Gross Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021
primarily reflected investments in rental fleet and other assets.

Our Gross Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €818.1 million, of which
€206.5 million was from Capital Expenditure (excluding acquisitions) and €611.6 million related to acquisitions, in each


-----

case based on the Reconciled Financial Information. Gross Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2020
primarily reflected the acquisition of Cramo and investments in our rental fleet.

**Free Cash Flow**

For detail on our definition of Reported Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, see "Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Summary Non-IFRS Measures and As Adjusted Financial Information" and_
"Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures."

**Net Debt**

We define net debt as gross debt (representing long- and short-term borrowings (excluding amortized costs) and
lease liabilities (excluding derivatives and financial guarantee contracts)) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt presented
as additional information because we believe that netting cash against debt may be helpful to investors in understanding
our financial liability exposure. However, other companies may present net debt differently than we do. Net debt is not a
measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measures of
performance derived in accordance with IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures" and
"Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures—Net Debt" for additional information.

_Information—LTM Financial Information" for further information._

Net debt increased by €228.7 million to €1,900.3 million as of June 30, 2023, from €1,671.6 million as of
December 31, 2022, primarily due to investments in our rental fleet and other assets as well as acquisitions during the
period, with Gross Capital Expenditure for the six months ended June 30, 2023 amounting to €289.1 million compared to
€225.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, partially offset by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA in the period.
Based on Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 of €540.2 million, the ratio of net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA was 3.5x as of June 30, 2023. See "Presentation of Financial Information—LTM Financial Information" for
further information.


-----

Net debt increased by €47.6 million to €1,671.6 million as of December 31, 2022, from €1,624.0 million as of
December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased investments in our rental fleet and other assets, with Gross Capital
Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounting to €551.2 million compared to €356.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA in the year. Based on Adjusted EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2022 of €523.8 million, the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.2x as of December
31, 2022.

Net debt increased by €7.6 million to €1,624.0 million as of December 31, 2021, from €1,616.4 million as of
January 1, 2021, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the acquisition of Cramo and investments
in rental fleet, which was partially offset by growth in Adjusted EBITDA and a decrease in finance expenses due to the
repricing of the Existing Term Loan B in June 2021. Based on Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021
of €485.8 million, the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.4x as of December 31, 2021.

**Contractual Obligations**

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.
(4) Represents undiscounted lease liabilities under IFRS 16. Our lease portfolio consists of real-estate leases, vehicle leases and the rental of

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of June 30, 2023, we are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees
given to financial institutions and certain commitments relating to capital expenditures, which primary relate to rental fleet
orders outstanding as of June 30, 2023. The bank guarantees primarily relate to contracts for the lease of real estate. See
note 29 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying
disclosures, at the end of the reporting period. These estimates and judgements are subject to change based on experience
and new information. The financial statement areas that required significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements are summarized in notes 2.4 and 3 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial
Statements, notes 2.4 and 3 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements, notes 1.7, 2 and 3 to the FY 2021 Financial Statements
and notes 1.8, 2 and 3 to the FY 2020 Financial Statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks**

We are exposed to various market and financial risks, including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk. These risks and the manner in which we seek to mitigate them are summarized below and described in
more detail in note 7 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, note 28 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements, note 4 to
the FY 2021 Financial Statements and note 4 to the FY 2020 Financial Statements.


-----

**_Market Risks_**

We are exposed to market risk mainly as a result of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency
(foreign currency risk) and our exposure to interest bearing liabilities such as loans (interest rate risk).

_Foreign currency risk_

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to our operating activities
(when revenue or expenses and their resulting receivable/payable positions are denominated in a foreign currency).

The majority of our revenue (66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022), expenses and obligations are
denominated in euro. However, we are exposed to currency risk mainly from our cash flows generated in Sweden, Norway,
the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. We also incur currency risk on the net investment in our operations
in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Our management has determined, based on a risk assessment, to hedge some of these currency risks by using
certain forward-exchange contracts. This policy is intended to protect our financial position. For additional information on
foreign currency risk and our foreign exchange contracts, see note 7 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, note 28
to the FY 2022 Financial Statements, note 4 to the FY 2021 Financial Statements and note 4 to the FY 2020 Financial
Statements.

_Interest rate risk_

We are exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest
rates. Our policy is to have a fixed/floating interest rate profile on the interest bearing liabilities which is fitting with the
nature of our assets. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with our hedging policy. As most of the interest
bearing liabilities have a floating interest rate, we have contracted certain interest rate swaps so that we receive floating
interest and pay fixed interest. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 69% of the outstanding
principal amount of our Existing Term Loan B was hedged through February 2028 with €1,000 million in nominal amount
of interest rate swaps outstanding. For additional information on interest rate risk and our interest rate swaps, see note 7 to
the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, note 28 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements, note 4 to the FY 2021 Financial
Statements and note 4 to the FY 2020 Financial Statements.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that we face when a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations. Credit risk mainly arises on cash and cash equivalents and receivable balances from trade and other
receivables and other longer-term receivables.

As of June 30, 2023, amounts exposed to credit risk include non-current loans receivable amounting to €9,840
million, trade receivables amounting to €227.4 million, other receivables amounting to €38.8 million and cash and cash
equivalents amounting to €1.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, amounts exposed to credit risk include non-current loans
receivable amounting to €2.5 million, trade receivables amounting to €210.4 million, other receivables amounting to €31.1
million and cash and cash equivalents amounting to €17.2 million.

Substantially all of our cash at banks is held with high credit quality financial institutions with credit ratings of A(S&P) or higher.

As of June 30, 2023, no significant increase in credit risk has occurred with respect to the above noted non-current
loans receivable. The expected credit losses for these balances were computed based on a 12-month expected credit loss
and was estimated to be remote. For additional information on credit risk, see note 7 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial
Statements, note 28 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we encounter difficulty in meeting our financial liabilities that are settled by
delivering cash or another financial asset. Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will
meet our liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to our reputation. We manage our liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and available credit facilities
through the continuous monitoring of future and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of our financial
assets and liabilities. For additional information, see note 7 to the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements, note 28 to the
FY 2022 Financial Statements, note 4 to the FY 2021 Financial Statements and note 4 to the FY 2020 Financial Statements.

**Certain Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS**

The FY 2021 Financial Statements and FY 2020 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. The FY 2022 Financial Statements and HY 2023
Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum were prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Certain differences exist between Dutch GAAP and IFRS that may be material to the financial information presented
therein.

The discussion set forth below summarizes certain differences identified between Dutch GAAP and IFRS as
applied by the Group, following a limited analysis of both sets of principles. For additional information on our first-time
adoption of IFRS, including reconciliations of certain financial information from Dutch GAAP to IFRS for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2022, see note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements. For a management reconciliation of our
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 from Dutch GAAP to a more comparable basis with
our financial information for subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS, see "—Reconciled Financial
_Information" below. See also "—Presentation of Financial Information" and "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of_
_our Results of Operations—Application of IFRS" above._

Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences
between Dutch GAAP, IFRS and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences
might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to,
or amendments of, IFRS may have on the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum, our results of
operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. See also "Risk Factors—Financial
_Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior_
_financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP."_

Some key differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS, as they relate to the Group, are listed hereafter. For
additional information, see note 30 to the FY 2022 Financial Statements.

    - **Goodwill: Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis.**
Goodwill under IFRS is required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. As a
result, we have reversed €46.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2021. See "—Reconciled Financial
_Information" below for information on the adjustments made for the Reconciled Financial Information_
for 2020.

    - **Leases: Under IFRS all leases are recognized in the balance sheet except for short term or low value**
lease contracts. Under Dutch GAAP financial lease contracts are presented "on-balance" and the
operational lease contracts are presented "off-balance". On the transition date (January 1, 2021), we
recognized €186.7 million of right of use assets and in total €183.9 million of lease liabilities. See "—
_Reconciled Financial Information" below for information on the adjustments made for the Reconciled_
Financial Information for 2020.

**_Reconciled Financial Information_**

The following reconciliation of our statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2020 between Dutch GAAP and the Reconciled Financial Information has been prepared by management to
aid in the understanding of our financial information on a more comparable basis with our financial information for
subsequent periods prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments to the FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP to present the Reconciled Financial Information have been prepared on a basis that our
management believes is consistent in all material respects as the basis on which our consolidated financial information is
prepared in accordance with IFRS. However, the presentation of the Reconciled Financial Information is based on certain
management assumptions and estimates, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, the
Reconciled Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent and may not give a
true picture of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 if we had prepared audited financial statements in
accordance with IFRS for such period. For example, the Reconciled Financial Information has not retrospectively applied
the IFRS requirements for business combinations as of January 1, 2020. Additional information on the basis of preparation
of the Reconciled Financial Information is set out below.

    - The Reconciled Financial Information has been prepared based on the audited FY 2020 Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP.

    - Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements to conform to IFRS
presentation requirements. For further information, see "—Line Item Classification" below.


-----

    - Adjustments have been made based on the IFRS adjustments made in 2021 and 2022. For further
information, see "—Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information" below.

The Reconciled Financial Information is unaudited, is not fully comparable with our financial information for
subsequent periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for our FY 2020 Financial Statements prepared in accordance
with Dutch GAAP. See also "Risk Factors—Financial Risks—Our current financial statements are prepared in accordance
_with IFRS and are not comparable with our prior financial statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP."_

_Notes to the Reconciled Financial Information_

A. Goodwill

Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. Goodwill under IFRS is
required to be capitalized, however, no amortization thereof takes place. The amortization for the period presented has
therefore been reversed within profit or loss. The impact is a reversal of €46.7 million amortization for the year ended
December 31, 2020 presented under depreciation and amortization expenses.

B. Leases

At the date of transition to IFRS on January 1, 2021, we applied a single recognition and measurement approach
for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (twelve months or less). As we started accounting
under IFRS as of January 1, 2021 for our entities in the Netherlands, we did not have the IFRS 16 accounting tools in place
in 2020. In the Nordics (entities acquired in our acquisition of Cramo), IFRS 16 accounting tools were in place in 2020. As
a result, for those countries where IFRS 16 accounting tools were not in place in 2020, we have made estimations based on
the actual lease expenses in 2020 and the Right of Use starting point at January 1, 2021. The total impact on the profit and
loss statement for the ended December 31, 2020 amounts to:

    - depreciation of right-of-use assets presented under depreciation and amortization expenses of €53.6
million were recognized in 2020;

    - lease expenses presented under material and services of €55.3 million were reversed in 2020;

    - lease liabilities interest expenses of €5.3 million presented under finance expense were recognized in
2020; and

    - the recognition of €0.3 million of revenue of subleases of real estate in 2020 which was presented under
revenue.


-----

C. Trade and other receivables

The adoption of IFRS fundamentally changed our accounting for impairment losses for financial assets by
replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forward-looking expected credit loss ("ECL") approach.
IFRS requires us to recognize an allowance for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through
profit or loss and contract assets. We assessed the impact of the change on transition date of January 1, 2021 to be
recognized in the statement of profit or loss for 2020 which has led to a decrease in net impairment losses on financial
assets in an amount of €1.2 million.

D. Revenue

Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business are recognized on a net (agent) basis. The
application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of revenue on a gross (principal) basis and
accordingly an increase in revenue was recognized in the 2020 financial year. We adjusted this by an increase of revenue
of €8.5 million and an equivalent decrease in material and services. We also adjusted revenue by €0.3 million for revenue
of subleases of real estate in 2020. See "—B. Leases" above.

E. Deferred tax

The various transitional adjustments (leases, trade and other receivables) results in different temporary differences.
Deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction in income tax expense. The total
adjustment amounts to €0.3 million additional tax expenses in 2020.

F. Defined benefit obligations

Defined benefit plan obligations are recognized and measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS19).
The pension expenses in 2020 related to defined benefit plans, which amounted to €0.8 million. This has been adjusted
under employee benefits expenses.

G. Statement of cash flows

Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as cash outflows from
financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities increased by €50.1 million and cash outflows from
financing activities increased by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Line Item Classification_

Certain line items have been reclassified from the FY 2020 Financial Statements for purposes of the 2020
comparative financial information presented in the FY 2021 Financial Statements. Certain of these line items have been
reclassified in this Offering Memorandum to conform to IFRS presentation requirements. The following tables set forth
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with the FY 2020
Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and the 2020 comparative financial information included
in the FY 2021 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, including certain information with respect
to the reclassification of line items to the presentation shown under "—Reconciled Financial Information" above.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

_Unless otherwise specified herein, the market data and economic and industry data and forecasts presented below_
_were obtained from publicly available information and third-party or independent industry publications. See "Presentation_
_of Industry and Market Data" for additional information. Market data are inherently forward-looking and subject to_

**Overview**

The equipment rental industry plays a key role in the value chain of significant and economically important endmarkets, including maintenance, infrastructure, construction, energy and energy transition as well as consumer-facing
sectors.

Equipment rental companies provide customers with a range for products from larger equipment such as aerial
work platforms, excavators, earthmoving equipment and forklift trucks, to smaller equipment such as power saws, power
generators, scaffolding, ladders, and small pumps. Rental companies are also active in rental markets for containers,
sanitation, portable kitchens and trailers. In addition to providing equipment, many rental companies provide holistic
support for their customers through a range of services such as maintenance, in-service inspection, repair, transportation,
storage, compliance with health and safety regulations, insurance and training on the proper use of the equipment. The
provision of holistic support along with equipment rental is becoming increasingly important for rental companies as large
end-customers incrementally outsource those previously in-house services.

Primary customers typically include engineering, procurement, and construction ("EPC") contractors, industrial
companies, government entities, infrastructure facilitators, utilities, maintenance operators, construction companies as well
as homeowners, craftsmen and small and medium-sized enterprises. A large portion of the equipment rental customer base
comes from the industrial and the commercial construction sectors. Commercial construction rentals are geared towards
contractors conducting new-build and repair and renovation work who rent a wide range of equipment from power tools to
backhoes. Industrial rentals are geared towards businesses conducting routine plant maintenance as well as for projects that
require specialized tools such as welding equipment, power washing equipment, forklifts and other material handling
equipment. Additionally, craftsmen as well as events and media companies have increasingly relied on rental solutions for
operational equipment such as power generators, portable toilets and specialized craft equipment. In parallel, specialized
rental equipment are supplied for specific projects, such as transfer pump, site hut, security gate, site safe and industrial
lighting. Increasingly, rental equipment are also requested in connection with the response to emergency situations and
incidents, such as natural disasters and refugee crises.

We operate depots in 18 countries with our key geographic markets being Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Finland and Belgium. The dynamics of the customer and geographic end markets we serve vary significantly, as described
below under "—Our Key Geographic Markets."

**Customer Value Proposition and Equipment Rental Business Model**

The long-term growth prospects for the equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, supported by
fundamental tailwinds as customers are increasingly renting (i.e., outsourcing) rather than owning operational equipment.
The shift to outsourcing is also driven by structural macroeconomic and regulatory factors that increase the attractiveness
of renting equipment. The advantages of equipment rental over ownership for companies includes:

    - **Cost and business flexibility: Equipment rental increases business flexibility by allowing companies to**
transform fixed costs into variable costs incurred on an as needed basis. In contrast, equipment ownership
entails a higher proportion of fixed costs and includes a number of ongoing costs in addition to the cost
of initial purchase, such as insurance, maintenance, in service inspection, repair, transportation and
storage and depreciation costs, which tend to increase over the life of the equipment. Equipment rental
also reduces the amount of capital required in comparison to purchasing equipment, reducing a
customer's exposure to credit market conditions and preserving capital for other investments, all of which
enables customers to focus on the core parts of their business.

    - **Equipment access and availability: Equipment rental gives customers access to a comprehensive range**
of equipment, including the latest generation of technology, allowing them to select the most appropriate
piece of equipment for the task at hand, which can improve safety, efficiency and quality. Equipment
rental also allows customers to benefit from a number of ancillary services provided by rental companies,
including training, safety testing, regulatory compliance, logistical support and consultation on
equipment selection. In addition, when renting from rental companies with a large network of branches,
customers are able to optimize their logistics flows to and from their worksites.


-----

    - **Climate change awareness: Rental of equipment is part of the larger developing circular economy,**
where equipment is rented by many customers over its life cycle allowing for better utilization rates while
the rental company maintains control over the equipment's good functioning order through a program of
maintenance and regular inspections. Equipment rental allows customers to be a part of this circular
economy and reduce their carbon emissions by reducing the overall size of their equipment fleet, limiting
their carbon footprint to the use of such equipment only and utilizing newer and more sustainable
equipment compared with company-owned equipment.

    - **Health and safety: Equipment rental generally enhances the operational safety of customers by**
providing modern, well-serviced equipment. In addition, equipment rental allows customers to more
easily benefit from the mechanization and automation of many of their operations, including hazardous
tasks, by providing access to and training on specialized equipment, such as power access tools.

In the European rental market, the key performance criteria mentioned by rental equipment customers consist of
the availability of equipment, equipment quality, location, flexibility, and safety, which can be more important than price
in certain markets. Small and medium enterprises ("SME") tend to place orders via sales representatives or through direct
engagement with a depot representative, while medium to large companies are increasingly ordering through online
platforms.

On average, a majority of rental equipment clients use two or more equipment rental companies primarily as a
result of assortment, availability and price differences for each product segment.

The economic value-add of a rental equipment provider is derived from the benefit from a lower break-even period
and enhanced returns compared to regular equipment purchasers as a result of more efficient fleet utilization, benefit from
centralized procurement contracts resulting in lower purchase prices, centralized and lower annual repair and maintenance
costs, benefit from higher resale value after the useful life and equipment financing benefits due to economies of scale.

The key growth drivers of the European rental market is a conjunction of both growth of the equipment rental
market and increasing market penetration, as described further below.

**_Growth of equipment rental market_**

GDP growth and construction market activity levels

Growth in the equipment rental industry tends to be closely correlated to growth in the construction market, as the
equipment rental industry generally forecasts growth levels in the construction market and responds to changing demand
related thereto.

The construction market is composed of three primary subsectors: (i) new residential and non-residential building,
(ii) renovation and maintenance, and (iii) infrastructure (which includes transportation infrastructure and
telecommunications, as well as energy and water works). While the construction industry as a whole tends to be cyclical,
within the overall construction market, individual end markets have differentiated growth patterns and dynamics. For
example, the renovation and maintenance end market tends to be less cyclical, as customers tend to reduce or delay new
projects in favor of renovation and maintenance work during periods of economic downturns. In addition, construction
activity can vary significantly between different regional and local markets, which provides further balance and
diversification to demand for rental equipment.

In 2022, a majority of the largest European construction markets surveyed by Euroconstruct registered higher than
anticipated growth at 3%, within an overall expansionary economic environment. The outlook for the overall European
construction market is trending lower in 2023 and 2024, mainly due to a slowdown in the residential sector, with return to
growth expected as soon as 2025. However, the maintenance and renovation sectors are expected to grow over the same
period due to increase driven by sustainability regulations and energy efficiency measures in a context of high energy
prices. This resonates with the recent European Green Deal proposals, with one of the main priorities revolving around


-----

renovation, energy efficiency and cleaner energy. This is further supported by local government regulations, notably in the
Netherlands' renovation and infrastructure maintenance markets.

We have a proven track record of minimizing the impact of economic trends on our business by diversifying our
specialist activities across non-construction related niche markets and focusing on the less cyclical phases of construction
market, such as the fit out, maintain, and operation phases. We also operate in multiple end markets in various countries,
which enhances our resilience and reduces our exposure to market volatility, macroeconomic developments and specific
events. Approximately 54% of our sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 come from non-construction customers,
indicating relatively modest exposure to the construction sector's cyclical volatility. Furthermore, our exposure to the
construction end-market includes a large part of less cyclical businesses such as fit out, maintain and operation, which
account for more than half of the construction-related sales.

Urbanization

Urbanization is a key driver of demand for rental services, as the population shift towards cities increases the need
for infrastructure development and maintenance. This leads to higher expenditures on large infrastructure projects, which
typically require a wide range of equipment and tools that are more cost-effective and convenient to rent than to buy.

**_Increasing market penetration_**

The European rental market has experienced a steady increase in its rental penetration rate over the past years,
reflecting the growing preference of customers to rent rather than buy equipment and tools. The rental penetration rate
varies across countries, with Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, France, Denmark and the UK being
relatively the most mature markets, and Eastern European countries having lower rental penetration rates, which offer
significant growth potential.

Increased benefits of rental versus ownership

One of the key drivers for the increase in rental penetration rates is the enhanced value proposition of renting
compared to owning equipment. Renting equipment offers access to modern equipment, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, as
it reduces capital expenditure requirements, fixed costs of ownership, and residual value risk, while allowing customers to
adapt to changing demand and project requirements. Moreover, large rental companies can leverage their scale and
expertise in purchasing, maintenance, and repair of equipment, offering a competitive advantage over smaller companies
that lack the financial resources for large fleet investments. Renting equipment also becomes more attractive for customers
in an uncertain or declining economic environment, as customers in general prefer to opt for flexibility and avoid the burden
of ownership and opt for more flexible and variable solutions.

Decarbonization and ESG initiatives

Another key driver for the increase in rental penetration rates is the growing pressure to decarbonize and adopt
ESG initiatives across various industries. Renting equipment is inherently part of the circular economy, as it maximizes
the utilization and lifespan of equipment, while ensuring its proper functioning and safety through regular maintenance and
inspections. Renting also reduces the operational complexity and waste associated with owning equipment, as it requires
fewer procurement, logistics, and disposal activities, while optimizing the carbon footprint. For instance, the building and
construction industry, which is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, can benefit from renting more energyefficient and ESG-friendly equipment from rental companies. As market participants require more energy efficient and
sustainable equipment, they are expected to rely more heavily on rental companies to provide the latest generation of
equipment.

Growing demand for digital solutions and add-on services

Rental penetration rates are expected to be driven by the rising demand for digital solutions and add-on services
that complement and enhance the rental offer and customer experience. Digitalization and technological advances enable
rental companies to provide more value-added services, such as fleet management, route optimization, environmental
reporting, online ordering and billing, which increase efficiency, transparency, and convenience for customers. Customers
also expect more instant and easy access to information and offerings, price comparison, and online reviews, which rental
companies can leverage to differentiate themselves and build loyalty. We have invested heavily in our digital capabilities
and platforms to offer a seamless and customer-centric service across our markets and segments.

Increasing preference for end-to-end proposition

Growth in rental penetration rates is also expected to be driven by changing customer preferences for end-to-end
propositions that provide turnkey solutions for their broader needs and project success, rather than just equipment or


-----

services for specific tasks. Customers seek more comprehensive and integrated solutions that cover the entire value chain
and offer a degree of flexibility and customization. Rental companies can respond to this demand by offering and providing
packaged solutions that include a full range of equipment and services, such as planning, installation, operation, and
maintenance that are tailored to the specific requirements and objectives of each customer and project. For example, we
have provided full turnkey solutions for an automotive gigafactory in Berlin-Brandenburg by supplying a full range of
equipment and services.

**Competitive Landscape**

The European equipment rental industry is highly fragmented, with a large number of small players serving local
or regional markets, and a smaller number of medium-sized to large players serving regional, national and international
customer bases. As a result, the industry has experienced a high degree of consolidation in recent years. For example, we
have completed 27 acquisitions since 2012, including the transformational acquisition of Cramo in 2020.

We believe we are the second largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, as
illustrated by the chart below. We compete primarily with large national and international equipment providers that offer
broad, generalized product ranges to customers. These include Loxam/Ramirent, and Kiloutou, both of which have a strong
presence in France.

In contrast to our largest competitors which have a higher focus on heavy equipment required in the new building
phases, our business model focuses more on lighter equipment used in the subsequent fit out, maintain and operate phase
(post-heavy equipment phase), resulting in less cyclical end-markets with higher degree of flexibility in equipment
allocation and utilization. Post-heavy construction phases tend to be more diverse in terms of workload and therefore
provide a greater opportunity to differentiate the product and service offering, including potential for ongoing service
elements.

We believe we have strong market positions across our main markets. We believe we have the largest market
share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of 2530% in the Netherlands, in Belgium an estimated market share of approximately 10%, and an estimated market share of
close to 20% in Sweden. We believe we have the second largest market share in Germany and Finland in terms of revenue
in 2022, with an estimated market share of 5-10% in Germany and more than 15% in Finland. In addition, we believe we
have a leading position in Norway with an estimated market share of 5-10%.

The equipment rental market is characterized by competition among operators who seek to differentiate
themselves on various factors including, the availability and quality of their equipment, the price and terms of their rental
contracts, the strength and quality of their sales relationships, the speed and reliability of their delivery and service, and
their adherence to health and safety standards. Despite the fragmentation of the equipment rental industry in Europe, the
leading players benefit from significant advantages over smaller players or new entrants, which create substantial barriers
to entry. These advantages stem from the large capital investments required to acquire and maintain a diverse and modern
fleet of equipment as well as to establish and operate a network of depots close to the areas of high demand. Moreover, the
largest equipment rental companies have built long-term and loyal relationships with key suppliers and customers, which
enable them to secure preferential terms and access to equipment and projects. Additionally, they benefit from economies
of scale, which allow them to optimize their costs and margins, and from strong brand positioning, which enhances their
reputation and customer loyalty.

________
Source: 2021 and 2022 based on ERA 2022 Market Report; 2023 and 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the German rental market is expected to reach a total size of
approximately €5.0 billion in 2022, an increase of approximately 2.0% compared to 2021, and based on the ERA June
2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by approximately 4.3% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. Demand in the construction
sector accounts for approximately 65% of the total market sales.

The German rental industry, Europe's second largest market after France, is characterized by a fragmented and
diversified competitive landscape consisting of a number of international and regional players with a strong local customer
base. We believe we are the second largest player in the market, with an estimated 5-10% market share based on 2022
revenue, with the largest player, Zeppelin, mainly focused on earthmoving equipment. Other large players include, HKL
and Mateco. Recently, foreign players including Kiloutou and Riwal entered the German market through acquisitions but
are still relatively small. German customer demand tends to be sophisticated in terms of higher focus on innovation, service
offering and quality, illustrated by an increasing demand for on-site services such as temporary traffic management, onsite power and water, safety management, and site access control. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these
factors with our strong services, network density and fleet offering, which include a wide range of equipment, from small
tools to large machines, as well as specialized solutions for specific sectors and projects.

The growth potential in Germany is significant and is expected to be primarily driven by two factors: increasing
penetration of rental equipment and fundamental growth in infrastructure and energy sector in the mid-to-long term. In
particular, the infrastructure and energy sector is expected to benefit from strong demand for infrastructure projects,
especially within highways and bridges, which require substantial maintenance and modernization. In addition, the energy
sector is expected to provide further growth, particularly as coal energy production is set to end by 2037, which necessitates
structural changes to Germany's current energy infrastructure, a trend which is also expected for other major European
countries.

Additional key trends in the German rental market that are expected to shape the industry dynamics and
performance in the coming years include (i) further consolidation of the fragmented market, as larger players seek to gain
scale and market share through acquisitions and partnerships, (ii) a focus on decarbonization of construction sites, leading
to increased demand for newer and more efficient equipment, (iii) substantial government expenditures on large
infrastructure projects, aimed at addressing a backlog of civil engineering projects (roads, bridges, rail) as well as
investments in 5G infrastructure and energy transition as a result of policies to increase renewable energy sources, and (iv)
increasing demand for one-stop-shop offering, over pure specialist rental companies, as customers seek to simplify their
procurement processes and benefit from a broader range of equipment and services from a single provider.

Source: 2021 and 2022 based on ERA 2022 Market Report; 2023 and 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report.

The Dutch equipment rental market is a sizable and growing sector, with an estimated value of approximately
€1.2 billion in turnover in 2022 according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. The market is forecast to grow at a rate of
approximately 2.4% in 2023 and accelerate to approximately 4.0% in 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report.
The growth prospects are supported by the ongoing and planned investment in various segments of infrastructure,
environment, and new technologies, with a focus on enhancing energy efficiency and security in the country.

The Dutch rental industry is characterized by a relatively high degree of consolidation, with a dominant player
and a few large competitors, followed by a number of smaller and more specialized or local providers. We believe we are
the market leader in the Dutch rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of approximately
25-30%. Although not directly comparable, other large players in the market include Collé, Loxam, Mateco, Peinemann
and Riwal. Smaller rental companies, with less than 50 employees, account for approximately 41% of the total market
sales, reflecting the fragmentation of the market.

Key trends in the Dutch rental market include: (i) consolidation, with smaller challengers being acquired by
established players, (ii) increasing demand for DIY and rental of small equipment, driven by a growing number of
independent craftsmen who prefer to rent rather than buy equipment for their projects, (iii) growing demand for
digitalization of products and services offering, with currently low penetration of digital solutions as well as packaged
services, (iv) increasing focus on emission and more hybrid solutions for rental equipment, due to stricter government
regulations and environmental standards that require more energy-efficient and less polluting equipment, and (v) increase
of maintenance and repair of infrastructure, with the recent Dutch government's announcement to address a number of
repair issues in the existing roads and bridges.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Swedish rental market has an estimated value of SEK17.9 billion
in turnover in 2022 and is forecast to grow by approximately 1.0% in 2023, accelerating to approximately 3.7% in 2024
based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report. Demand in the construction sector accounted for approximately 70% of the
total market sales in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report.

We believe we have the second largest market position in the Swedish rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022,
with an estimated market share of close to 20%. Other major competitors include Ramirent/Loxam and Renta.

Compared to other European countries, the Swedish rental market is mature and has a high rental penetration rate,
meaning that a large proportion of construction equipment is rented rather than owned. In the medium to long term, the
market is expected to benefit from the structural trends of public investment in greener iron, steel and battery production,
as well as the shift to renewable power generation from wind and solar sources.

Sweden has one of the highest rental GDP and construction sector penetration in Europe, as well as high standards
for safety, quality, and environmental performance. Customers are increasingly demanding end-to-end rental solutions that
cover not only the equipment, but also the ancillary services such as on-site traffic management, waste management, and
safety solutions. Moreover, there is a strong demand for modern and safer machines that have a lower environmental
footprint, as the market is moving towards decarbonization and sustainability.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Finnish equipment rental market has an estimated value of
approximately €0.7 billion in turnover in 2022 and, based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by
approximately 5.2% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024. Demand in the construction sector accounted for approximately 70% of
the total market sales in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report. The construction market saw significant growth
in 2022, reflecting positive developments in infrastructure and non-residential projects. The market outlook for the medium
term is favorable, as the rental penetration rate and the outsourcing trend from ownership to rental are expected to increase
further in the coming years.

The competitive landscape of the Finnish rental market has historically been dominated by two local major
players, Loxam/Ramirent and Boels/Cramo. However, the market has recently witnessed the emergence of Renta as a new
player, driving up investments and increasing competition through consolidation with small players. The market is also
characterized by a large number of smaller companies (with 1-49 employees), which generated approximately 63% of the
total industry revenue, and large firms (with over 250 employees), which generated approximately 37% of total industry
revenue according to the ERA 2022 Market Report.

Merger and acquisition activity in the Finnish rental market has been relatively stable, especially compared to the
neighboring markets of Norway and Sweden, which have seen more consolidation in recent years. The investment level in
the market is high, as companies seek to renew their fleet and add more sustainable fleet options, as demand for equipment
such as crane equipment and electric machinery increases. The demand for greener equipment is supported by investment
from the public sector.

Key trends that shape the Finnish rental market include: (i) a growing demand for add-on or packaged services,
(ii) an increasing focus on digitalization with connected fleet and digital services, (iii) a rising focus on decarbonization
and greener solutions following Finnish regulations aimed at reducing the emissions of the sector, and (iv) a geographical
polarization, with construction and equipment rental market concentrated in the main urban areas.

Source: 2021 and 2022 based on ERA 2022 Market Report; 2023 and 2024 based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the Belgian equipment rental market has an estimated value of
approximately €0.7 billion in turnover in 2022 and, based on the ERA June 2023 Strategic Report, is forecast to grow by
approximately 4.1% in 2023 and 5.0% in 2024 as construction activity is projected to improve.

The rental companies in Belgium have benefited from the strong recovery of the rental demand, which has resulted
in full order books through mid-2023. As the rental volume growth normalizes in the medium term, increasing rental
penetration rates are expected to drive further growth in the industry.

The Belgian rental industry is characterized by a high level of fragmentation, whereby only a few rental companies
have national coverage, caused by the regional split between Flanders and Wallonia and the related language differences.
Generally, Flanders tends to have more specialized rental companies that are oriented towards the non-construction sector,
while Wallonia tends to have more generalist rental companies that are focused on the construction sector. This is a
distinctive feature of the Belgian market compared with other European markets (except for Switzerland) and has not
significantly changed in the recent years. Given that most rental players are local rather than national, the language barrier
increases the barriers to entry for new domestic or foreign players, as they need to adapt to the different customer needs in
each region.

We are one of the few players with nation-wide coverage in Belgium and we believe we have the largest market
position in the Belgian rental industry in terms of revenue in 2022, with an estimated market share of approximately 10%.


-----

Other large players in the market include Loxam and TVH. Small rental companies (less than 50 employees) contributed
approximately 75% to the total market sales in Belgium in 2022, according to the ERA 2022 Market Report.

According to the ERA 2022 Market Report, although investment levels were flat in 2022 compared to 2021,
Belgian rental companies are renewing their fleet and adding new machinery as market demand is trending higher for
smaller machines, access equipment and platforms. The transition to hybrid machinery or battery powered equipment has
resulted in increased demand, but this is still slow and not expected to materialize meaningfully in the short-term. However,
in the longer term, environmental regulations and customer awareness of environmental issues are expected to drive a more
significant increase in demand. Additionally, outside the construction and industrial sectors, there has been a substantial
increase in rental demand in the Belgian events sector.

**Overview**

We are a leading rental equipment specialist in Europe. We believe we are the second largest equipment rental
company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, with strong market positions across our main markets, including the largest
market share in each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden and the second largest market share in each of Germany and
Finland, in each case in terms of revenue in 2022. Our family-owned business started out of four garage boxes in the 1970s,
and, under five decades later, has expanded into an industry leader with an extensive network of 759 depots in 18 European
countries and a fleet of approximately 860,000 rental units as at June 30, 2023. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
we generated €1,524.9 million in revenue and €540.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA.

We serve customers in a variety of end-markets from civil engineering, industrial, construction and infrastructure
to events and warehousing. Our core product offering includes general and specialist rental equipment alongside
complementary products and services, enabling us to be a one-stop-shop for our customer base of both corporate clients
(business-to-business) and individuals including craftsmen and retail clients (business-to-consumer). Our generalist
division is mainly focused on the less cyclical 'fit-out, maintain and operate' market segments which use lighter equipment,
while our specialist division is tailored to reach niche markets, such as site preparation, sanitation and access control.

With approximately 860,000 rental items, with a purchase value of €2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, we offer our
customers access to one of the largest, widest, highest quality, and latest ranges of rental equipment and tools in Europe,
for use in the fields of civil engineering (such as excavators, landscaping tools and dumpers), transport and handling (such
as forklifts, cranes and trailers), climate control (such as heating and cooling systems, mobile boilers and air purifiers), and
construction (such as construction site and installation products), among others. In addition to our vast range of tools and
equipment available in our general depots, we provide a wide range of specialist products to niche markets primarily outside
the construction industry, which we believe differentiates us from our competition and contributes to our strong brand
recognition and greater diversification in terms of end-markets and product offering. Our specialist products range from
HVAC systems and hoisting and lifting machines to mobile LED screens, temporary housing solutions, portable kitchens
and heavy duty pumps. In parallel, we offer "do-it-yourself" ("DIY") shop-in-shops across Europe, in partnership with DIY
retailers where retail clients get access to primarily smaller equipment rental, which we believe further renders our business
less cyclical than the traditional equipment rental business. Our corresponding service lines are geared towards further
simplifying our customers' complex projects and include equipment service and maintenance, fuel management, training
courses, project management and emergency assistance.

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain information for the following four geographic regions:

    - **_The Netherlands, which generated €362.9 million in revenue (representing 23.8% of our revenue) in the_**
twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland,_**
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which generated €538.9 million in revenue (representing 35.3% of our
revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023;

    - **_Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which_**
generated €576.8 million in revenue (representing 37.8% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023; and

    - **_Other Countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom, which generated €46.4 million in revenue_**
(representing 3.0% of our revenue) in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

In addition, in six months ended June 30, 2023, we introduced segmental reporting in line with IFRS 8 "Operating
Segments" for the first time. For additional information on our operating segments, see "Presentation of Financial
_Information—Operating Segments."_


-----

We operate under two main brands: Boels Rental and Cramo. Boels Rental, the original brand of the Boels Group,
is active in 12 countries in Central and Western Europe and we believe holds the strongest brand recognition across our
portfolio. Cramo is active in the Nordic and the Baltic states, having been an independent leading rental company in Europe
since 1953 before we acquired it in 2020.

We operate a hub-and-spoke depot network, consisting of 681 general rental product depots and 78 specialist
rental product depots as of June 30, 2023. We believe the decentralized structure of our network enables us to provide our
products and services to our customers more conveniently and efficiently, while also supplying us with a diversified and
local customer reach. In countries where we have an extensive depot network, such as the Netherlands and Germany, each
depot is connected to a central hub location. In countries with larger markets, we have several hubs. Our depots generally
stock smaller and more commonly used equipment, while the larger and less commonly used equipment is stored at our
hubs, from where they can be easily shipped directly to a customer or local depot as needed. We believe this structure
allows us to make more efficient use of our fleet and minimize transport movements.

Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded significantly over the past
decade, both in terms of geographical reach and product offering. Since Pierre Boels Jr. became the CEO of Boels in 1996,
we have executed a growth strategy based on product portfolio diversification and greenfield openings (including through
international expansion), as well as through strategic bolt-on acquisitions executed to enter specific geographic areas (such
as Germany, the UK and the Nordics) or specialist markets (such as industrial rental and traffic service). In 2020, we
acquired Cramo, which positioned us as one of the largest equipment rental companies in Europe and complemented our
geographic presence with an expansion into the Nordics and a further extension of our Central European offering. In
addition, our 2022 acquisition of Eekels Pompen allowed us to expand our specialist product line by adding a high-quality
offering of pump rentals to our customers with niche needs.

The sharing economy is at the very heart of our business, and we believe that long-term growth prospects for the
equipment rental industry continue to be favorable, driven by increased consumer preferences for rental instead of
ownership. From our perspective, renting provides our customers with optimal availability, accessibility, and capital
deployment, enabling them to reduce the amount of capital required for their operations, and, in turn, increase their capacity
to deploy it for other investments. As such, our rental concept aims to help customers and their end-consumers meet their
targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality and sustainability. We also believe that rental, compared to ownership, can
contribute positively to the environment. Therefore, alongside the benefits that we strive to offer our customers, we also
invest in products and solutions that align with our commitment to advancing sustainability in our and our customers'
industries.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe our success is attributable to the following competitive strengths which will drive our future growth:

**_Leading market positions in a large and growing European market supported by favorable underlying growth drivers_**

We have grown significantly since our founding in 1977 as a local rental company. Since then, we have grown
into a multinational company through a combination of organic growth and transformative and bolt-on acquisitions. With
the Cramo acquisition in 2020, which allowed us to expand our operations in the Nordics and Baltics while strengthening
our network in Western and Central Europe, we have created a true pan-European rental equipment player with increased
scale and resilience. We believe that our current footprint provides us with beneficial scale in strong and growing
geographic and customer end-markets.

We believe we are the second largest equipment rental business in Europe by rental revenue in 2022. As of June
30, 2023, we operate a comprehensive depot network of 759 depots, comprising 681 general rental depots and 78 specialist
rental depots. We believe that our scale is particularly important as a provider of rental equipment, because it helps us
optimize fleet utilization rates through our ability to easily relocate units to areas with higher demand for specific types of
equipment and provides us with additional bargaining power in negotiations with OEMs and equipment suppliers and
maintenance partners. We believe that our scale and our market leadership also help to increase our brand recognition and
affords us with greater opportunities to attract and retain talented and experienced personnel.

In the Netherlands, which is historically our cornerstone market, we believe that we hold a strong leader position
with between 25% and 30% of market share based on revenue in 2022, which we believe is significantly ahead of our
competitors. We believe we are also the leader in Belgium with approximately 10% of market share and the second-largest
player in Germany with between 5% and 10% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022. With the acquisition
of Cramo in 2020, we expanded our presence into five more European markets (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and
Lithuania) and significantly strengthened our position in six European countries where Boels and Cramo had a joint
presence. We believe that we are the second largest player in Sweden, with close to 20% of market share, and in Finland,
with more than 15% of market share, in each case based on revenue in 2022.


-----

We believe that the markets we address are strong and poised for further growth. According to the ERA 2022
Market Report, the total market size of the top 15 European rental equipment markets is estimated to have increased by 4%
from €24.7 billion in 2021 to €25.7 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow by 3.3% in 2023 and 5.6% in 2024. According
to the ERA 2022 Market Report, the European market is expected to remain strong, driven by an increased rental
penetration and a structural shift in customers' preferences towards renting rather than owning equipment. This shift is
supported by the attractiveness and flexibility offered by renting, as it optimizes the split between operating costs and
capital expenditures by reducing the fixed portion of maintenance and fleet replacement costs and allows customers to
avoid investing in expensive equipment that may not be used frequently. Moreover, the transition to achieving net zero
CO2 emissions amplifies this effect, as electric equipment is generally more expensive. This structural shift is expected to
support continued demand for rental equipment companies' products and services over the medium and long term.

We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from growth and positive trends in the equipment rental industry.
The European rental equipment industry is still highly fragmented, consisting of a large number of small companies serving
local or regional markets, with a limited number of medium to larger companies serving regional, national and international
customers. We believe we are one of only a few companies with a strong pan-European platform, with strong relationships
with the key equipment OEMs. We compete with a large number of smaller competitors locally and a few larger
international competitors. We believe that we are well-positioned for growth by leveraging our scale and footprint, while
relying on our proven approach of customizing our strategy for each local market, while centralizing our key operations.

**_Resilient business model supported by robust diversification across geographies, end markets, products and customers,_**
**_supported by a notable depot network_**

We strive to minimize the impact of economic cycles through continually maximizing our rental fleet utilization
rate, developing specialist activities focused on non-construction related niche markets, diversifying our customer base by
investing in a broad product range aimed at non-construction related customers and focusing on the less cyclical phases of
construction projects.

We have a diversified footprint and address several different customer end-markets, helping to mitigate our
exposure to macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, with the acquisition of Cramo, we significantly increased our
geographical diversification, bringing our revenue generated in the Netherlands to 24% of our total revenue for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023, compared to nearly half of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Moreover,
no single country represented more than 25% of our revenue generation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We
believe that this enhanced geographic diversification gives us greater resilience during periods of slow economic growth,
as different countries operate within different economic cycles. Based on our revenue and EBITDA growth, we believe we
outperformed our largest European competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving the resilience of our business
model.

The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023.

We address multiple customer end markets, which also contributes to our resilience in reducing the impact of
volatility of external factors such as market conditions and macroeconomic developments. We have positioned ourselves
as a leading generalist equipment rental company that is also active in the attractive specialist sub-segment and in DIY,
with specialist rental and DIY representing 28% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, approximately 54% of our sales were derived from non-construction end-markets, indicating a
relatively modest exposure to the cyclical construction market. Furthermore, our exposure to the construction end market
includes a large part of less cyclical phases of construction activities, such as the fit out, maintenance and operational
phases.

The chart below provides a breakdown of our revenue by end markets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.


-----

Over time, we have continued developing our expertise in specialist rental equipment, focusing on nonconstruction related end-markets, such as site preparation, modular space, measurement, testing and safety, sanitation,
portable kitchen, hoisting and lifting, access control, and industrial rental and pumps. We believe our specialized knowledge
is key to our ability to service different niche markets, providing further resilience and less exposure to the more cyclical
construction market. By leveraging our generalist rental equipment business, we also aim to provide the best and most
comprehensive rental solutions for our customers with the objective of cross-selling our specialist equipment to fuel future
growth. Ultimately, our specialist business represents a key peer differentiator with customers, which we believe provides
for higher returns.

In parallel, we also operate in the niche market of DIY rental, with more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops as at June
30, 2023, where customers at DIY retail stores have access to primarily smaller equipment rental such as tools. This type
of business is less cyclical than traditional equipment rental market and the costs to operate this business are typically lower
than other equipment rental businesses due to the strong operational leverage of the existing rental depot network. In the
DIY market, we are able to offer convenience as a differentiating factor to our customers, generating higher customer foot
traffic in the stores, at a time when e-commerce is putting a strain on retailers and brick-and-mortar stores.

We strive to offer a wide range of equipment and tools across all the phases of construction projects, including
the build (both heavy construction and fit out), operate and maintain phases. Our business model also hinges on providing
a diversified range of products to our customers. We particularly focus on smaller equipment rentals, such as perforators,
ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding equipment, which represented approximately 48% of our
rental revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. These rentals position us within the less-cyclical 'fit out',
'maintain' and 'operate' phases of the asset cycle, as demand for such rentals is typically more resilient and makes us less
dependent on lengthy construction projects. For example, smaller equipment rentals tend to be more sought after for
renovation and maintenance use, which are inherently less exposed to cyclical demand than other end uses. As of June 30,
2023, with a fleet of approximately 860,000 equipment units, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized
equipment, in addition to value-added services such as logistics, we aim to provide full turnkey solutions to strengthen our
customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner.

Furthermore, with a comprehensive network of 759 depots (strategically located within a 50-kilometer reach of
our key customers and project sites across Europe) and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30,
2023, we are capable of mobilizing our rental fleet even in remote places for any customer or user at the right time, through
multiple delivery methods: pick up and return or delivery to desired locations. By constantly adapting our network to
changes and fluctuations in the market, we have the strategic ability to open or close access points near our customers.
Based on market trends or developments in specific regions in Europe, we can adapt swiftly and embrace changes in our
industry.

Our hub-and-spoke networking model provides a diversified customer reach and develops efficiency and
flexibility in our operations, ensuring that we are close to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return
or project delivery. This proximity to our customers results in shorter transport times, lower costs and lower CO2 emissions.

Supported by our broad product offering and dense network, we also benefit from a large and diversified customer
base, serving numerous customers of different sizes and from different sectors through our various channels (both generalist
and specialist rental products) ranging from DIY customers, cash customers and craftsmen to large industrial, services and
construction companies, potentially operating in different economic cycles. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our
top 10 customers accounted for 7.4% of our revenue, with no single customer representing more than 2% of our revenue.
We benefit from strong customer loyalty, evidenced by the fact that our 10 largest customers by revenue have, on average,
an approximately 20-year relationship with us.

**_Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust fleet management and digital_**
**_capabilities_**

We differentiate our offering from most of our peers by focusing on smaller rental items, such as tools and access
equipment, in addition to construction equipment and containers. The chart below shows our revenue breakdown by product
category for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

Over the last five years, we have invested more than €1.4 billion to renew our rental fleet, with €448 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a young, well-invested fleet with a historical purchase value of approximately
€2.8 billion as of June 30, 2023. These investments have reduced the weighted average age of our fleet to 53 months as of
June 30, 2023, allowing us to offer our customers the latest advanced equipment and sufficient headroom to reduce or delay
our capital expenditures during economic downturns.

The chart below shows our rental equipment fleet's average useful life and its age (in months), by product category,
as of June 30, 2023.

Our tools product category, which amounted to 16% of our rental sales for the twelve months ended June 30,
2023, has the lowest spread between average useful life and average fleet age in our fleet, with an average of approximately
3.5 years of use remaining before ultimately needing to be replaced.

Our smaller equipment, such as perforators, ladders, scaffolding, power saws, power generators, sanding
equipment, and other small tools, are characterized by superior unit economics compared to our other product categories,
as they lead to higher money utilization rates (defined as our twelve-month fleet sales divided by the historical purchase
price, based on the weighted average price by number of rental units). For the year ended December 31, 2022, our money
utilization rate for the tools and light equipment product category was higher than our larger product categories, such as
construction equipment, which we believe results in an increase in our return on fleet investments and an increase in our
resilience through business cycles, given our high exposure to the tools and light equipment category.

The chart below shows our money utilization rate for our different types of rental equipment for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023.


-----

Our focus on tools and access equipment makes us less dependent on lengthy construction projects and more
exposed to the less cyclical renovation market, where we have a better pricing power among our smaller customers. On
our major long-term projects, we often provide a full range of equipment from small hand-held tools to larger equipment,
reflecting our ability to support our clients on their various steps and needs with adequate and available equipment. This
ability to provide full range of equipment in due time ultimately fosters relationships with our clients, creating recurring
revenue streams and the potential for cross-selling between our generalist and specialist equipment.

We have developed a robust asset management strategy for our extensive fleet. Our fleet management strategy
covers the entire lifecycle of our equipment units, which includes purchasing, renting, and equipment servicing, as well as
reselling the equipment at the end of its financial or economic lifetime. When making purchasing decisions, we seek to
provide a true one-stop shop experience for our customers by ensuring a high degree of availability across our entire rental
range and equipment that is adapted to their needs. By closely monitoring trends, events and market prices, we can quickly
adjust and adapt our offer to customers' needs. For example, the share of Eco-labelled equipment in our fleet is relatively
high and growing in line with higher market demand for electrical, hybrid or battery-powered equipment and the highest
sustainability standards. Simultaneously, we seek time- and cost-efficiency to maximize our economies of scale and fleet
occupancy performance. These initiatives improve our fleet availability and utilization rates while minimizing our
maintenance capital expenditures.

We have implemented an advanced and integrated infrastructure to drive decision making for our fleet, such as
enterprise resource planning and specialized hardware and software. This asset management system allows us to track the
complete life cycle of any rental asset in our fleet, providing us with visibility on our any given item (such as depot
performance, inventory levels, fleet allocation and pricing) and the ability to adjust our fleet investment and pricing. This
enables us able to serve our customers according to their needs, quickly and efficiently. In addition, this system makes it
possible to limit downtime and improve utilization rates and pricing. Finally, as a piece of our equipment reaches the end
of its lifecycle within the Company, we believe that we are able to optimize the timing of its resale and maximize its resale
value through closely following secondary market prices and trends and taking third-party insights into account.

Our fleet management strategy also relies on a central procurement strategy. This enables us to benefit from
economies of scale and allows us to be close to our OEMs and their product development, positioning us at the forefront
for the latest products in terms of efficiency, safety and sustainability. In addition, our relationships with OEMs not only
allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of
materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with
our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
We also foster our relationships with our OEMs by collaborating on technological developments and data analyses, and we
aim to deepen our cooperation with them further.

In addition, we have invested and continue to invest in the latest technology to help us efficiently process our fleet
maintenance and repairs and minimize our related costs and administrative workload. These technological capabilities
allow us to be in full control of depreciation and replacement strategies and therefore systematically improve our fleet
usage, composition and performance. We monitor and reduce the impact machine repairs and maintenance have on lifetime
costs and resale value.

Finally, we seek to be a leader in innovation and digital transformation across the entire rental process, which we
believe results in higher customer satisfaction and percentage of recurring business, better fleet damage control and
substantial emissions savings. We were an early adopter of digital offerings in the European rental market, having
anticipated this trend by preparing a detailed mapping of our customer experiences per segment, with the aim to simplify
online rental in all our customer's life cycle stages and provide a one-stop-shop solution: from becoming a customer to
online renting, logistics, usage, having all relevant information available and invoicing. In parallel, this digital
transformation generates operational efficiencies by allowing us to optimize our processes such as transport and logistics.

**_Strong financial and operational track record supported by counter-cyclical cash generation through capital_**
**_expenditure flexibility and proven M&A integration capabilities_**

Our financial performance has been driven by a strategic combination of strong organic growth and the successful
integration of both transformative and smaller bolt-on acquisitions, which have expanded our geographical reach and
product offering. Since our foundation more than 45 years ago, we have been focused on increasing scale and achieving
sales growth. Our business model is based on actively distributing our fleet through our depot network, directly competing
with local players and ultimately winning market share by providing newer equipment and better customer service. This
model has delivered a proven track record of strong growth over the past decade. Between 2012 and 2022, our revenue
grew at a CAGR of approximately 19%, significantly exceeding the growth of the economy, the construction market and
the equipment rental market over the same period in Europe.

While delivering robust sales growth, we have also managed to retain steady and high margins, with an Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 35% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. By being highly focused on maintaining a high portion
of variable costs, we have managed to retain our profitability during economic downturns.

The following chart shows our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth from the year ended 2012 through the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

(1) For comparability purposes, revenue growth between 2019 and 2020 is expressed as 2020 revenue pro forma to reflect the acquisition
of Cramo as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, compared to 2019 revenue pro forma to reflect the acquisition of Cramo as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2019, each prepared under Dutch GAAP. Revenue for 2019 has been prepared solely for illustrative purposes
based on management estimates utilizing a simple aggregation of the revenue of Cramo and our revenue for the year ended December
31, 2019.

We have the ability to actively manage our fleet investment based on existing market conditions and the stage of
the industry cycle, which has contributed to our counter-cyclical cash generation. In an industry growth cycle, we invest in
our rental fleet to enhance our product catalogue and expand into new products and markets. In a downturn, with our newly
invested young fleet, we can rapidly reduce our capital expenditures and postpone our investments, streamline our depot
network and the size of the fleet, and pay down debt with our strong cash flows resulting from lower capital expenditures.
Our business has flexibility to make investment decisions on a regular, short-term basis, and has no long-term expansionary
capital expenditures commitments. Therefore, we are generally able to quickly adjust our fleet investments to respond to
the changing market environment. For example, recently, we were able to quickly adapt our investments in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on maintaining our existing fleet through reduced capital expenditures. After the
stabilization of market conditions in 2021, we resumed our investments by increasing our capital expenditures.


-----

The countercyclical nature of cash generation and our ability to adjust our capital expenditure while preserving
our cash generation through the cycles supports our conservative leverage policy and enables us to deleverage during
challenging economic periods, as we did during the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, the double dip recession,
and more recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

(3) Total net leverage calculated based on Reported EBITDA.
(4) Represents Capital Expenditures (excluding acquisitions).

Acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy that we pursue either for geographical expansion
(filling in gaps in our existing footprint), increase market share, acquire specialist knowledge, improve our competitive
position, or acquire certain assets. We have a clear, defined and well-established acquisitions strategy with a dedicated
integration team in place.

The success of our international expansion and our ability to effectively integrate acquired companies is
demonstrated by our track record of 27 successful acquisitions since 2012. In particular, we demonstrated our disciplined
M&A strategy and execution with our transformative acquisition of Cramo in 2020. During the 6 months of the initial
integration period, our management executed a clear integration plan to minimize execution risk related to the acquisition,
while maintaining a high quality service for our customers and efficiently responding to their needs. In countries where
Boels and Cramo had geographic overlap, such as in Germany, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, we focused
our efforts on optimizing our depot network, rebranding and refurbishing Cramo's depots in Central Europe (including
Germany), enhancing our cross-selling opportunities and optimizing our back-office functions. We also invested
substantially in integrating the fleets in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, increasing the availability of fleet and our
flexibility, allowing us to optimize our response to market demands. In 2021 and 2022, we invested in and deployed new
equipment categories that meet specific local requirements as a result of our analyses of the local markets, in order to be
less dependent on large projects, with the aim to reach small and medium enterprises and retail clients.

As a result of such efforts, we were able to successfully integrate our Central European operations in only 10
months and achieved synergies in terms of centralization of our mutual best practices in our key operations: IT, finance,
fleet management and human resources through the deployment of our One Boels strategy. As a result of these efforts, we
believe we have realized significant synergies, which generate recurring savings in EBITDA and capital expenditures,


-----

primarily due to the optimization of our procurement functions, the consolidation of our IT systems and the reduction of
our corporate expenses (including as a result of the closing of Cramo's headquarters in Finland).

We believe that our acquisition track record, including our ability to integrate companies, positions us for growth
while strengthening our local presence. The success of our international expansion supports our financial and operational
development and establishes us as a market consolidator in a fragmented equipment rental industry. For further details
about certain of our recent acquisitions, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions, Geographic Expansion and Depot Openings."_

**_Strong senior and local management teams with extensive industry experience_**

We have a strong management team with extensive experience in the equipment rental industry and a track record
of operational excellence, led by one of the most recognized and distinguished people in the industry, Pierre Boels Jr., our
Chief Executive Officer since 1996 and President of the ERA between 2016 and 2022. The members of our management
are further supported by divisional and regional managers in an organizational structure that empowers entrepreneurship
spirit and decision making. Jan Piet Valk, our Chief Financial Officer since 2020 and member of our Management Board,
has acquired a proven international experience through his previous chief financial officer positions. He is responsible for
the overall financial management, M&A strategy, health and safety policy, legal, treasury, sustainability and real estate
matters and is involved in all key decisions in the company. Mr. Valk has recently been awarded "CFO of the Year" by
Financieel Management, in recognition of his independent role in the leadership of our Group, his management skills and
his board position.

Under Mr. Pierre Boels Jr.'s leadership, we managed to significantly increase our sales and EBITDA, both
organically and through acquisitions, having successfully executed and integrated 27 acquisitions since 2012. Our CEO
has assembled an experienced management team with significant industry expertise, including:

    - Reiant Mulder, Chief Operations Officer of Central Europe and member of our Strategic Board with
more than 20 years of services experience.

    - Guy Cremer, Chief Procurement Officer, working with us since 1989 and leading in the Fleet
Management department since 2000. Additionally, Mr. Cremer was recognized with the award for
"Rental person of the year" by ERA in June 2023 for his influential role in the shift towards lower carbon
emission equipment last year; and

    - Martin Holmgren: Chief Operations Officer of Nordics and a member of our Strategic Board. Mr.
Holmgren is also Vice President of ERA and has worked for almost 30 years in the construction and
rental industry.

Our highly qualified senior management team is in close contact with our local business directors, since
investment decisions strongly benefit from local market knowledge. For example, the choice between opening a greenfield
location when expanding into a new region or acquiring an established company in the region is based on local insights
about rental company concentration provided by local business leaders: we consider acquisitions when rental concentration
is high and greenfield expansion in locations where rental concentration is low.

We have an external Advisory Board that meets five times a year and consists of a group of experienced
entrepreneurs and leaders. This independent body advises the Management Board on policy matters and the general course
of affairs of the Group. In addition, the Advisory Board and its individual members function as a critical sounding board
for our Management Board. We are in the process of implementing a two-tier board system by the end of 2025 and have
started the search for a Supervisory Board, which will supervise the general course of affairs in the company and the
businesses affiliated with the company. It will also supervise the functioning of the Management Board as such and the
policy conducted and will provide the Management Board with advice. For further discussion on our management team,
see "Management."

**_Ambitious CSR targets to lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental industry and mitigate environmental_**
**_impact throughout the value chain_**

We strive to lead our company with high business ethics and lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental
industry. We have set ambitious CSR targets to position ourselves as a front runner in the development of a safe and
environmentally friendly business and a key partner to our customers in meeting their increasing needs and demands for
more sustainable solutions.

We believe that the core purpose of rental, compared to ownership, is the achievement of the efficient use of
equipment and materials, therefore making a positive contribution to the circular economy. According to a research study


-----

led by ERA, efficient use of equipment results in a reduction of approximately 30% to 50% of CO2 emissions (depending
on specific user practice) and that the rental business model stimulates such efficient use. Our rental concept allows our
customers and their end-customers to meet their objectives and targets in terms of costs, efficiency, quality, safety and to
reduce their carbon footprint.

CSR topics are at the heart of our business model. We also chose to apply the Global Reporting Initiative 2021
("GRI 2021") Standards and Disclosures to report our sustainability-related data, to commit to the guidelines of UN Global
Compact and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals relevant to our business. In addition, based on a formal
materiality assessment, we have identified four focus areas covering all aspects of corporate and social responsibility,
including Employee Care, Social Care, Customer Care and Environmental Care. We have also identified, key performance
indicators in relation to each topic and set ambitious targets for 2025.

We aim to be the leader in sustainable fleet investments, to enable our customers in executing their projects with
the lowest level of emissions, while continuing to deliver profitable growth. Our Green Team, which includes members
from our fleet, sales and marketing departments, has jointly set out a strategy to invest in anticipation of customer needs
and develop ambitious and innovative solutions (including zero emission equipment) in their field. For our fleet, we invest
in energy-efficient products to improve our energy performance. For example, our fleet includes electrical two-ton
excavators, fully battery-operated six-meter telehandlers and over two-ton electric-wheeled loaders. We also have a wide
availability of battery packs and have created solar panel roofs for site huts and new zero emission welfare units, which
were both brought to market in 2022. Additionally, our fleet contains more than 1,000 Stage V engines meeting the EU
standard for non-road machines with low emissions of particulate matter.

Our state-of-the-art fleet adheres to strict environmental and safety performance standards and helps increase our
customers' productivity while reducing their emissions footprint. Of our total energy powered fleet units (equipment driven
by a motor and with all types of power), approximately 81% is electrically-powered as of December 31, 2022 and we aim
to increase this percentage to 85% by 2025. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 67% of our fleet value was comprised of
electric, hybrid and gas equipment and not motorized equipment (meaning, equipment without an engine or motor). We
have steadily reduced the portion of our diesel-powered equipment as a percentage of fleet value over time, reaching 24%
as of June 30, 2023 (excluding Stage V diesel powered equipment). A breakdown of our fleet value by type of power as of
June 30, 2023, is presented below.

**Our fleet value as of June 30, 2023 (in € billion)**

Furthermore, during 2022, we have made significant progress in offering resource-efficient and sustainable
alternatives to customers, supporting them to minimize climate impact:

    - We increased the share of units powered by electricity within our energy-powered fleet.

    - We increased the share of Eco-labelled fleet.

    - We invested over 1.63% of our total fleet value in high-tech, zero-emission machines, with a target to
reach 4.7% by 2025.

We also continuously work to mitigate our own climate impact by reducing energy consumption, increasing the
use of renewable energy and increasing circularity of our products and operations. We reduce, reuse or recycle materials,
reduce waste and handle hazardous waste properly. For facilities and installations, we invest in energy efficient products,
services and design for energy performance improvement. For example, we have been increasing our energy efficiency
while reducing our emissions through investments in sustainable technologies and services, LED lighting, solar panels,


-----

better insulation or development of energy management systems. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our
energy use relative to sales by 12%, compared to 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our gas usage
by 28% to 8,900 MWh compared to 2021, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,670 tCO2 of our emissions.
We are also improving logistics planning in order to limit emissions related to equipment deliveries, as well as increasing
our purchase of more renewable energy.

We also disclose the Group's greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect
emissions) with clear reduction targets. In 2022, we announced a number of targets with respect to our carbon emissions
for 2025, using 2021 as a baseline, including:

    - reduce our emissions (calculated in tCO2) relative to sales (Scope 1 and 2) by 20%;

    - reduce our energy use relative to sales (Scope 1 (direct energy use) and Scope 2 (purchased energy)) by
15%; and

    - increase our share of renewable electricity to above 92% (compared to 56% in 2022 and 49% in 2021).

Simultaneously, we are assessing our scope 3 targets with the main initiatives expected to be set as soon as 2024.
For a further discussion of our commitment to environmental and social governance matters and our targets for 2025, see
"Business—Environmental, Social and Governance."

**Strategies**

Our business strategy focuses on profitable growth, further enhancing operational efficiency, strengthening our
market position in all segments, expanding our service offerings, developing innovative digital solutions to improve
customer efficiency and promoting corporate social responsibility.

**_Achieve a leading position in all our markets and become a leading partner for our customers_**

We intend to continue working to provide a high quality, one-stop-shop experience for both individual consumers
and businesses, while ensuring that our entire rental range of products meets our customers' evolving demands, in order to
achieve a leading market position in each of the markets we address.

We believe that we are well-positioned to become the leading partner of our customers in all the geographies we
serve. We believe that our customers already recognize us as a preferred one-stop-shop for their rental needs, primarily due
to our diversification across products, end markets, general and specialist rental, and our strong European geographic
coverage. Our acquisition of Cramo has demonstrated our ambition to keep strengthening and expanding our geographic
coverage and diversifying our service offering.

We believe we can achieve a leading position in our markets through our strong, long-term partnerships with our
customers. In order to strengthen our customer relationships and remain our customers' preferred rental partner, we aim to
provide full turn-key solutions, ranging from providing generalist tools to more specialized equipment (including site huts,
site safes, traffic sets and sanitation), in addition to value-added services such as logistics. For example, in 2021, we
delivered full service rental solutions for a wind farm project in Lithuania by providing site huts, construction equipment
and special tools, in addition to access control, on-site maintenance, and helping with planning, transportation, delivery.
Since 2022, we provide full turnkey solutions for an automotive Gigafactory located in Berlin-Brandenburg. We combine
our proximity to customers and our understanding of their needs in order to continue providing our customers with valueadded services and products. Finally, we intend to continue pursuing our fleet investment strategy, which aims to maintain
a complete range of sustainable and safe rental equipment.

**_Grow through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions_**

We have achieved an impressive track record of both sales and EBITDA growth through a strategic combination
of strong organic growth and the successful integration of both our transformative and smaller bolt-on acquisitions.
Through our acquisition strategy in particular, we have expanded to cover new geographic markets and have diversified
our catalogue of products and services.

We believe we have significant opportunities to continue growing organically due to our comprehensive network
of 759 depots and more than 3,100 DIY shop-in-shops across Europe as of June 30, 2023. We intend to increase the density
of our network in less concentrated regions which we believe have a strong potential of profitable growth through our clear
greenfield expansion strategy.


-----

We also intend to continue evaluating strategic acquisition targets to further strengthen and expand our operations
and customer base, to selectively enter new markets over time, in particular in geographic areas with low rental company
concentration to increase opportunities for upselling and cross-selling our products. . In pursuing such acquisitions, we
maintain the same disciplined, targeted, and opportunistic acquisition investment criteria that have historically enabled us
to successfully identify acquisition targets and profitably acquire and integrate them.

Successful integration of acquisitions is key to our strategy, and we believe we are well-positioned to integrate
future acquisitions efficiently and profitably. We have dedicated integration teams supported by local teams with superior
knowledge of their local markets to develop synergies in our fleet management, expedite the completion and integration of
acquisitions and position us to achieve our long-term success.

**_Drive digital innovation to increase productivity for our customers and improve our operational efficiency_**

We have developed and intend to continue to develop digital services in order to improve our customers'
experience and boost our operational performance.

We believe that we are a leader in the development of new, innovative digital business models in our industry.
We have developed and deployed new types of data- and connectivity-based solutions to connect our people, internal
processes and fleet to our customers, such as our new smart application for mobile devices, "Equipment Pool", which
improves customers' access to equipment and machines, while reducing transportation times to and from customers'
construction sites . We believe that we can leverage our digital processes and use of data in a customer-focused manner in
order to improve communication between our employees and our customers, better identify customers' needs and facilitate
interactions and transactions with customers.

Although we already have improved processes and digital tools in place to optimize our customers' experience,
we intend to continue enhancing our rental websites, including those of Cramo, Boels Rental and IQ Pass, to add further
equipment data and specifications and combine our general and specialist rental fleet in a single platform. We believe that
such technological capabilities positions us to achieve the full potential of our one-stop-shop solutions.

We also intend to continue leveraging digital tools to streamline and boost efficiency in our internal systems. For
example, we have implemented a single group-wide financial system to monitor our cash flows and key performance
indicators. We have also implemented our group-wide One Boels strategy in order to continue harmonizing systems and
processes based on four pillars: (i) One IT approach; (ii) One financial organization, (iii) One fleet and procurement
organization and (iv) One HR approach and organization. We have developed our One Boels strategy as a clear, distinct,
and strong organization that focuses not only on our customers' needs, but also boosts our efficiency. We intend to continue
enhancing our operational systems and processes to increase our operational and procurement efficiency, improve our
strategic relationships with OEMs, strengthen our fleet management and negotiating position for strategic procurement and
maintenance of our fleet, and enhance our employee retention.

**_Maintain top-tier performance as a leading rental company_**

We aim to maintain our operational performance by systematically improving and optimizing fleet usage,
composition and performance. Historically, we have had a more centralized business model where our rental fleet was
managed centrally to optimize the allocation of equipment, while local managers organized by countries and depots offered
knowledge of local markets. Cramo, on the other side, has historically had a more decentralized business group structure,
where operating decisions were made at the country and business-unit level. With the integration of Cramo, we have
developed a synergized approach, which aims to combine the best practices of both organizations by centralizing key
operations such as procurement or fleet management, while we keep a flexible and locally oriented commercial approach
for each market and geography.

We believe that this approach, together with our close cooperation with, and monitoring of, our depots, business
units and departments, positions us to achieve our strategy, whilst retaining our disciplined and flexible business and
financial models.

**_Reinforce our commitments to the environment, safety, quality and corporate responsibility_**

We are committed to promoting and maintaining corporate sustainability and responsibility as a core component
of our business. We intend to continue being a leading climate- and resource-efficient rental company, paving the way to
enhance sustainability in the rental industry and to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our value chain. We
believe that our value chain perspective on sustainability helps us identify how we can optimally manage our impact on
the environment while efficiently operating our business. We also strive to meet our customers' increasing needs and
demands for more sustainable solutions.


-----

We are convinced that maintaining an adequate corporate governance policy is a prerequisite to structure the
organization efficiently and effectively and achieve our strategic goals. We also believe that our sustainability policy helps
us to manage risks and to consider the interests of all our stakeholders, including our shareholders, our employees and our
customers. We discuss our material sustainability topics, focus areas and strategic targets twice a year with our Strategic
Board and our Operations Board, and periodically with the Sustainability Steering Committee that we have implemented
to help us achieve our sustainability goals. For a further discussion of our commitment to environmental, social and
governance matters and our targets for 2025, see "Business—Environmental, Social and Governance."

**History and Development**

Before Boels was incorporated in the Netherlands in 1977, our family started the business with four garage boxes,
lending tools to friends and acquaintances. In 1980, we opened our first formal office in Sittard, and in the 1990s, we
expanded to Belgium and Germany and began supplying mobile kitchens and in-shop rental points in DIY stores. As we
continued on our trajectory of organic growth and expansion, Pierre Boels Jr. became CEO in 1996 and implemented our
European growth strategy. In 2000, we commenced a full-service offering with OneCall, which provides customers with a
single point of contact for their rental needs. We celebrated 25 years in business in 2002 with 650 employees and 65 depots
in three countries. In 2004, we opened our 100th depot.

During the early 2000s, we strategically expanded into countries and activities that were complementary to our
original footprint and product and service base. In 2007, we commenced operations in Austria, Slovakia, the Czech
Republic and Poland, and at the end of 2011, we acquired Baurent Baumaschinen Miet-Service GmbH, a construction
machinery and equipment rental company, expanding our presence in Germany. In 2015, we acquired leading specialist
companies in climate and energy rental, shop-in-shop rental and earthmoving equipment. In 2017 we opened our 400[th]
depot. In 2017 and 2018, we completed additional strategic acquisitions in the United Kingdom, while also adding to our
industrial rental operation by acquiring Abird.

The year 2020 marked an important point in our history, where our fleet exceeded the €2.0 billion purchase value
mark for the first time reflecting both our organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe we became the second
largest equipment rental company in Europe based on revenue for 2022, all within 50 years of selling our first product, an
11-kilo breaker. That year, we acquired the listed Finnish rental company Cramo, integrating the five Central European
countries where Cramo's presence overlapped with Boels and raising the overall number of countries in which we operated
in to 18. In 2021, we launched our sustainability motto "Orange is the new green," highlighting our commitment to assisting
our customers in building and working with lower emissions. In 2022, we acquired Eekels Pompen, a Dutch specialist
pump company, expanding our product portfolio. That same year, we launched our One Boels program to integrate
overhead activities, such as finance, HR, fleet management and IT throughout our entire network into the Boels
organization. Our expansion through strategic acquisitions continued through June 30, 2023 with the acquisition of Illumin8
in the UK and BAS Maskinutleie, Hyresbutiken AB, and Kraftx AB in the Nordics. For further details about our recent
acquisitions, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions, Geographic Expansion and Depot Openings."_

**Products and Services**

Our core product offering consists of general and specialist rental equipment in addition to complementary
products and services, as well as the selling of used rental equipment as an integral part of our fleet management. Our used
equipment sales help maintain optimal levels of fleet availability, age and variety. In the twelve months ended June 30,
2023, our revenue was comprised of approximately 70% revenue from equipment rental and approximately 30% revenue
from sales of products and other services.

**_Equipment Rental_**

We are a leading provider of rental equipment and services in Europe for various sectors, including civil

control, lifting and hoisting, surveying, safety, traffic services, earthworks, cleaning, flooring, and sanitation. Our rental
product portfolio consists of two segments: general rental and specialist rental. As of June 30, 2023, we have 681 general
rental depots and 78 specialist rental depots.

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, general rental generated 72% of our total revenue, and specialist rental
(including DIY) generated 28% of our total revenue, comprised of 25% generated by specialist rental (excluding DIY) and
3% generated by DIY. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, generalist rental generated 73%, 74% and
73% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, specialist rental (including
DIY) generated 27%, 26% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively.

epidemics. Such help can include the opening of temporary depots and the rapid redeployment of large
portions of our fleet, including fencing, emergency road signs and power generators. While individual
products mirror those in our general and specialist rental segments, under this range they are organized
and marketed for the needs resulting from specific emergencies, such as providing equipment and set up
for COVID-19 vaccination sites during the pandemic.

    - **Long-term rental, including equipment and machine leases from one to five years, paired with**
maintenance and inspection.

    - **Project management and implementation, whereby our project managers assist customers in**
organizing the necessary equipment, personnel and other requirements for their complex projects,
including an HSE plan. As part of this service, our customers can also benefit from our assistance with
installation and maintenance, with specialists available 24/7.

    - **Site management, including facility services such as security, installation, cleaning and waste**
management.

    - **Service and maintenance, including equipment inspections, certifications and checks, and assistance**
with malfunctions.

    - **Fuel management, which leverages smart meter technology so that we can monitor our customers' fuel**
levels remotely. As part of this service, our suppliers periodically visit our customers to refuel their
diesel-powered equipment.

    - **OneCall, our customers' single point of contact for all their rental needs, including questions regarding**
our product offerings, reservations and even invoicing.

    - **Training courses, including equipment training courses, safety courses and more custom training**
courses such as toolbox presentations, tailored to our customers' particular needs.

    - **Product sales, including consumables and machine accessories. We also sell used machines and tools.**

**Customers**

We offer our products and services to a broad and diversified customer base of more than 670,000 customers who
generated revenue in the twelve months as of June 30, 2023. Our customers range from large international companies to
small- and medium-sized businesses, craftsmen and retail clients, who operate in many sectors, such as industrial, offshore,
warehousing, infrastructure, chemical, events, construction, and infrastructure.

Regardless of their size or industry, many of our customers have time-sensitive and complex projects, and we
believe that our vast network of depots and wide range of general and specialist offerings allow us to meet our clients'
needs.

We also believe that increased use of data and digitization of processes can have a positive impact on our customer
experience and are focusing on investing in solutions that improve customer centricity and processes. We continuously
work to improve our rental website and portal (MyBoels) by updating equipment data and specifications, for example
combining specialist items into a one-stop solution platform where our customers can access information on equipment
availability, reservations, contracts, product details and invoicing across our general and specialist segments. We have
implemented several data-driven dashboards to facilitate our monitoring of KPIs, progress and trends in order to better
identify and anticipate issues. For certain major customers with high transaction volumes, we have built custom Enterprise


-----

Resource Planning ("ERP") and procurement system integrations, which allow them to connect to our IT system for access
to our electronic catalogue, order-to-cash integration, and e-invoicing. Our sales team actively promotes this service as part
of our rental offering to increase efficiency of renting across all of our depots for our large clients.

With our largest key accounts and managed customers, we negotiate framework agreements establishing pricing
policies for our equipment. These agreements typically have a duration of one to three years. Certain framework agreements
contain discounts based upon volume commitments made by the customer. Smaller and more localized customers are
typically subject to our standard terms and conditions.

We have a diversified customer base, with our top 10 customers accounting for approximately 7.4% of our revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and no single customer accounting for more than 2% of our revenue over the same
time period. As a result of our diversification efforts over the past three years, we have decreased the percentage of our
revenue derived from our top 10 largest clients. Furthermore, our customer base is loyal and has a high retention rate, with
our top 10 customers having an average relationship with us of approximately 20 years.

We believe that we have limited concentrations of credit risk in trade receivables as a result of the spread of our
business across customers, markets and regions. Sales on account are only made to customers that meet the Group's credit
rating requirements. Goods and services are sold subject to payment terms, the majority of which range between 15 to 60
days. A different payment period may apply to major customers, in which case additional security is demanded, including
guarantees. Credit risks are routinely monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms per customer. Outstanding
trade receivables are regularly monitored and legal action is taken against debtors with long outstanding balances. Overall,
we believe that our exposure to long-outstanding balances exceeding the post-paid terms is not significant.

**Sales and Marketing**

We maintain and invest in a strong sales and marketing organization, which we believe enables us to both maintain
close and loyal relationships with our existing customers and expand our reach to attract and retain new customers. Our
client management system operates on a tiered system based on size and geography. Within Boels, our local and small
business customers are generally served by local depot managers and commercial rental employees who provide our
customers with counter service and information on the rental process and equipment. Midsize customers are served by
regional account managers and large key accounts are managed by key account managers who often operate internationally.

Our sales and marketing departments, combined with innovative digital solutions, work to anticipate our clients'
needs based on feedback from both customers, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and suppliers, as well as
industry research and trends. All of our customer interaction and feedback is stored in a centralized Salesforce platform,
using cloud services across sales, services and marketing. The Salesforce platform is used and updated on a daily basis by
approximately 2,500 employees at Boels working in rental, sales and services.

We believe that our use of digital solutions offers our customers convenient, fast and tailored products and
services. Our self-service portals allow our customers to view their rented products, pricing, contract, invoicing and delivery
information. Since the launch of the MyBoels portal, customers have been able to access more granular data on their rentals
such as fuel and battery levels and service errors.

For our major customers (including in the industries of infrastructure and construction), we have implemented
building information modelling ("BIM") models, which are digital platforms that create and manage 3D models for
building and infrastructure projects. BIM models are relevant at all phases of construction projects, from initial planning
and design to construction and ongoing maintenance. The BIM models of our rental products are stored in our product
information management systems, which are accessible through the MyBoels portal.

In 2022, we invested in a project to optimize customer experience and engagement with our local listings, which
aims to provide customers with immediate digital access to the nearest depot. As a result, each depot's opening hours,
address and contact details are updated in real time across all our marketing channels and related online sources.

**Rental Fleet**

As of June 30, 2023, we had a fleet of approximately 860,000 pieces of serialized rental equipment units, with a
purchase value of €2.8 billion. We strive to offer a wide range of equipment and tools, representing 30 product groups
across generalist and specialized equipment and tools. We strongly focus on lighter equipment, which positions us on the
'fit out', 'maintain' and 'operate' phases of the asset cycle. As of June 30, 2023, our fleet is comprised of approximately 39%
tools, 27% energy and climate, 13% material handling, 11% site huts and site preparation, 5% earthmoving and 4% access
equipment. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €813 million in rental revenue from our fleet only
(excluding revenue on fleet items), of which tools and light equipment generated 48% (comprised of tools generating 16%,


-----

material handling generating 12% and energy and climate generating 20%), access equipment generated 25%, earthmoving
generated 13% and site huts and site preparation 14%.

With the goal of providing the European market with the best and latest equipment, we aim to invest strategically
in high-quality equipment that adheres to strict environmental and safety performance standards. In the year ended
December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, investments in our fleet increased the number of serialized
rental items by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, reflecting a broadening our existing assortment and our continued
investment in the Eco-label fleet to meet higher market demands for electrical, hybrid and battery-powered equipment with
high sustainability standards. We have continued to expand our fleet to include Eco-Label, Zero Emission, and ZeroEmission Evolution offerings. Machines and tools with the Eco-Label are less harmful to the environments in which they
operate in terms of emissions, vibrations and noise. As a result, they are better for the health of the user and local residents.
Zero Emission machines and tools that are manufactured to not emit carbon dioxide and Zero-Emission Evolution machines
and tools are those which we believe are at the forefront of technical development and make a larger impact in reducing
our customers environmental footprint. Examples of these include larger telehandlers, certain types of dumpers, and 4x4
heavy terrain scissor lifts.

For a further discussion of our fleet management investment decisions, see "—Fleet Management."

We have a well invested fleet as evidenced by the young weighted average age of our fleet which was 53 months
as of June 30, 2023, compared to 54 months as of December 31, 2022, which we believe will allow more flexibility in our
capital expenditures over the near to medium term.

**Fleet Management**

The asset management strategy for our extensive fleet that we have developed is based on a diversified deployment
of equipment. We work to provide a one-stop-shop experience for our customers and aim to ensure that our rental range is
available when needed, all while striving to minimize time and costs of delivery of equipment to customers and maximize
economies of scale and fleet utilization performance. As part of our strategy, we divide our equipment into several
subgroups which we believe enables us to analyze the most efficient and strategic routes for deployment, in addition to
targeting the best possible use for our customers. Our fleet categories (Access, Earthmoving, Energy and Climate, Materials
Handling, Site Huts and Site Prep, and Tools) are split into subcategories based on the characteristics of each item. By
tracking maintenance costs and fuel consumption, among other metrics, we believe we are able to determine which piece
of equipment is best suited for the job at the lowest cost and emissions. An increasing number of our fleet items are equipped
with telematics, allowing us to track more data and provide our customers with up-to-date metrics on their usage on our
recently launched MyBoels portal. Furthermore, we monitor fleet location, utilization and other metrics in one central
system. This allows us to have full visibility on individual depot performance, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and
manage fleet allocation across our networks as well as plan and monitor capital expenditures.

The following graphic illustrates asset management strategy.


-----

**_Digital innovation_**

Our fleet management system tracks the complete life cycle of any rental asset at our disposal by serializing the
vast majority of items within our fleet.

Data from information technology systems provides us with a comprehensive overview of the health, profitability
and productivity of our fleet. Utilizing this data allows us to provide recommendations to our customers concerning which
machinery might meet their requirements best. Additionally, in each depot we keep a record of each missed rental caused
by an item being unavailable either in a local depot or in our fleet more broadly. We believe this allows us to better
anticipate local demand and further optimize our logistics system.

We invest in innovative technology that enables us to not only track our rental items on a continuous basis but
also to process fleet maintenance and repairs efficiently and with relatively low administrative costs. We believe this allows
us to promptly register any equipment part for maintenance, thereby reducing duplicate purchases, as well as reducing the
frequency of asset audits, and rapidly identify lost items. In 2022, we fully integrated digital document management in our
fleet management system for all rental items, including with respect to all test certificates and CE declarations. Therefore,
this system now allows us to track important documentation with respect to legal or regulatory compliance and further
work to enhance our quality control and assurance, while reducing costs and equipment downtime through regular
maintenance checks and repair.

**_Procurement_**

Our position as a leader in the European rental market has enabled us to create strategic relationships with our
OEMs. Because we primarily employ a centralized procurement strategy, and due to our close relationships with our OEMs,
we believe that we are able to influence product development at the stage of manufacturing, so that we can remain at the
forefront of product innovation. For example, we have collaborated with our OEMs on various product improvements for
our rental equipment, including the standardization of lighting units, type and positioning of support wheels and the
placement of protective brackets, suspension points and lift points to aid in loading. This procurement strategy has also
provided us with the ability to negotiate prices, better analyze constraints in supply and explore ground-breaking
technological developments. While 2022 marked a challenging year in terms of supply chain constraints, our procurement
strategy allowed us to mitigate their effects on our operations. See also "—Suppliers" below.

**_Life cycle management_**

Our fleet management strategy also offers services across the entire life cycle of our equipment units, including
long-term rental, equipment servicing, and the resale of the equipment at the end of its financial or economic lifetime. The
digitalization of our system has facilitated our fleet maintenance and repair strategy. For each numbered item in our fleet,
we keep track of the total cost of ownership, which allows us to determine which brands or items are most efficient from a
cost/quality perspective. Additionally, we believe this data enables us to determine the optimal time to sell to avoid
increased maintenance costs for ourselves while still offering the buyer a quality tool that can last. We may also decide to
sell certain equipment sooner in cases where there is insufficient rental demand for such products. We sell our used
equipment through various channels, of which direct sales from our warehouse and auction sales are the most important.
We generally sell our used equipment outside of our principal markets, and occasionally we may need to sell equipment as
scrap.

The disposal of any piece of equipment from the fleet is a technical decision made by a technical manager based
on analysis, recorded metrics, and historical lifetime expectations. We have established metrics and guidelines for each
category of equipment that help determine the desired replacement cycle. Most metrics are based on repair costs relative
to rental income, utilization rate and age.

**_Strategic investments_**

When in line with our growth strategy or otherwise key to overall performance, we invest in integrating and
updating our fleet and we are able to react with agility to optimize our investments in response to changes in demand. For
example, in 2020, shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially reduced our capital expenditures and
focused on achieving the synergies from the Cramo acquisition. Through consolidating depots in certain regions and
increasing the density of our network in others, we were able to increase the utilization rates of our fleet. Following the
Cramo acquisition, we also relocated equipment in order to generate better returns. In 2021 and 2022, we invested
substantially in updating our fleet, which we believe not only increased our revenue and results, but also increased our
flexibility and allowed us to react more quickly to increased market demand as end-market activity picked up. For a further
discussion of our capital expenditures during the periods under review, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures, Fleet_
_Age and Equipment Disposals."_


-----

**Suppliers**

We employ a centralized procurement model to leverage our scale. Alongside our OEMs, we plan and develop
the equipment and machines we believe are needed in our markets and market segments in Europe, whether general or
specialist.

We believe our long-lasting relationships with large and recognized OEMs allow us to obtain useful information
on new product innovations and assess market demand. Together with our OEMs, we analyze the time horizon for the next
three years in terms of market demand whereby we address our requirements in terms of quality, safety and low
maintenance costs. Our relationships with OEMs not only allows us to negotiate better prices, but it also give us insights
on the availability issues that may occur due to shortages of materials. In 2022, the equipment markets suffered from supply
chain shortages. Due to our excellent relationships with our OEMs, we were able to successfully navigate these shortages.
See "—Competitive Strengths—Well-invested fleet focused on smaller equipment with strong unit economics and robust
_fleet management and digital capabilities" for additional information. Additionally, the sheer volume of our fleet provides_
important data to the OEMs on their equipment, which we believe gives us additional leverage in managing our relationship
with our OEM suppliers.

We do not consider ourselves dependent on any single supplier, with most pieces of equipment available from
multiple different suppliers with whom we have a relationship. As of December 31, 2022, our top 10 suppliers accounted
for approximately 11.1% of our total purchases for that period, with no single supplier representing more than 3% of
purchases for that period.

**Our Network of Depots**

As of June 30, 2023, we had a network of 759 depots across the Netherlands, Central Europe, Northern Europe,
and Other Countries. Out of the total number of depots, 681 are general rental depots and 78 are specialist depots.

The table below shows certain information on our depot network by geographic region as of June 30, 2023:

**Total number of depots**
**The Netherlands ..................................................................................................................** **147**
**Central Europe ....................................................................................................................** **361**

**Total......................................................................................................................................** **759**

Our hub-and-spoke, decentralized business model enables a diversified customer reach, allowing for increased
efficiency and flexibility in operations and an expansive physical coverage. With this extensive network, we are able to be
closer to our customers and their projects, whether for pick-up and return or project delivery. We believe that from an
operational standpoint, this model reduces transport time and emissions, which from a service perspective results in shorter
delivery and quicker response times for our customers.

Our network of depots has grown significantly over the course of the past decade through a combination of organic
growth and strategic acquisitions. Our network management is dynamic and the decision to open a branch is driven by our
analysis of the interaction of the proposed branch and our existing network, the conditions in the local market and the
competition within that market. Whether we open a new branch or acquire an existing network depends on the level of
saturation in that market and whether acquisitions can provide us a level of penetration that would take too long to develop
organically. Branches may be merged or closed based on the market environment (if, for example, a large construction


-----

project concludes or an industrial site closes) or excess proximity to another branch following an acquisition. We may also
relocate branches in light of the development of cities or the evolution of infrastructure, or to optimize our geographical
coverage.

We implement periodic network optimization plans to enhance the profitability of our depot network through
better coordination of commercial activities and capital expenditures, pooling of resources, integrating overhead and backoffice activities between regions, improved exchanges of staff and equipment among branches and enhanced depot and
hub positioning.

Our depots are generally located around cities, particularly in the Nordics where economic activities are
concentrated in urban areas. While our depots generally offer the same equipment, in certain industrial or more rural areas
our depots may carry slightly different inventory to anticipate local demand.

Our depots operate under the Boels and Cramo brands.

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2023, we had over 7,400 permanent employees.

Our employees perform the following functions, among others: sales and marketing operations, maintenance and
parts operations, rental operations, technical service and office and administrative support.

Our employees are a core part of our business and we invest in their development and training, which are key
priorities to ensure our customers consistently receive high-quality products and services. We place a strong emphasis on
employee training, including safety and competence-based training, and strive to support our employees' career growth.

We operate a defined contribution plan for our employees and pay contributions to pension funds and insurance
companies on a contractual basis. Besides these contributions, we have no other obligations to pay further contributions by
virtue of these pension plans. Of our foreign group companies, only Boels Rental Germany GmbH, Cramo AB and Cramo
Services Sweden AB have their own pension plans as a result of a historic pension arrangement applicable to a specific
group of former Cramo AG employees. These plans qualify as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19.

Certain of our employees are represented by various works councils, unions and other employee representative
bodies and are subject to collective bargaining or works council agreements. For certain courses of action, we require our
works councils' and unions' consent, and for others, we are required to ensure our works councils and unions are informed
of the processes or have an advisory role in undertaking such actions, as applicable. We believe we have a strong
collaboration with our employees, works councils and unions based on clear processes and trust.

**Information Technology**

Over recent years, we have invested significantly in various IT systems to improve our internal operations, our
sales and marketing processes, and our interactions with our customers. Operationally, we employ a centralized and robust
information technology platform, which we refer to as One IT, whereby we strive to provide digitization, connectivity and
innovation across our operations in a secure fashion. For marketing and sales, we have implemented and invested in
improving various digital platforms to provide our customers with access to our products, such as self-service portals, ecommerce websites, and BIM models. We also employ the use of an optimized Salesforce CRM system to store customer
information, interactions, and needs.

In 2021, as part of our "One Boels" strategy, we focused on integrating Cramo's IT operations in Central and
Northern Europe into the integrated hardware and software backbone of our IT systems, covering 5,000 workstations. In
addition to undertaking this integration, and improving our customer experience on our Boels website, we implemented
numerous digital programs in line with our IT strategy. These included our "Customer Excellence Programs" and mobile
applications such as the Logistic application, Boels traffic service application, disaster management application, and waste
data application. The customer applications and portals provide real-time information to the customers at each stage of the
rental process from product search, reservation, ordering and logistics to invoicing. As part of this IT strategy, we also
invested in developments to our company dashboards to improve our performance monitoring capacity with respect to
operations, finance and HR and with respect to compliance measures, such as cash register and security systems. In
addition, we implemented three additional data systems in 2021, including a Robotics Process Automation ("RPA") system
(which automates certain manual processes), a Product Information Management ("PIM") system (which we use to help
us process large amounts of complex product information and to distribute this data through their relevant channels, both
internally and externally), and a Digital Asset Management ("DAM") system (which has the capacity to organize and
manage digital content and assets for communication purposes, including brand logos, designs, images, video,
presentations, and text files).


-----

In 2022, we introduced a new company-wide digital workspace (social intranet) for all countries, which is geared
towards improving tailor-made internal communication and stimulating collaboration and interaction between all
colleagues and across all departments. The intranet is a single platform for employees that contains information, news
articles, HQ support, product information and best practices.

In addition, we operate the One Boels IT team, which is located in Sittard and Stockholm. The main IT systems
are SAP4H, Salesforce CRM, SAP SuccessFactors and One Digital with SAP Commerce Cloud. The integration was built
with MuleSoft technology and Microsoft Azure. The Backend ERP systems of Cramo and Boels (including SAP4H) are
fully integrated with the Digital Frontend Portals and Salesforce using MuleSoft enterprise integration and Azure
technology. Through this technology, our employees and customers are able to view the same real-time data as it relates to
sales, support and field use.

**Intellectual Property**

We use several trademarks, mainly including the "Boels," "Cramo," "Niebo," "RENTPARTNER," "TRENDRENT," "IQ-Pass" and "Eekels Pompen" brands, all of which enjoy high brand recognition in their home markets. Our
"Boels" trademark, and several of our other key trademarks are registered in the countries where we do business, including
the UK, the Netherlands and other members of the European Union.

Our trademarks, domain names, copyrights and all of our other intellectual property are important assets that
afford protection to our business. Our success depends to a degree upon our ability to protect and preserve certain
proprietary aspects of our technology and our brands. To ensure we meet that objective, we control access to our proprietary
technology. Our employees and consultants enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with us. We protect
our rights to proprietary technology and confidential information in our business arrangements with third parties through
confidentiality and intellectual property and business agreements.

We hold a number of third-party patent and intellectual property license agreements that afford us rights under
third-party patents, technology and other intellectual property, including for the use of certain material software
applications. We cannot ensure that future license agreements can or will be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms, or
at all.

**Environmental, Social and Governance**

We are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing local, national and European Union-level laws and
regulations, including those relating to emissions to the air, pollution of water and land, and the handling, storage,
transportation, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to
Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Energy Efficiency
Directive (EED), and the Plastic Regulation, Batteries Regulation, Packaging Directive, Regulation (EU) 2019/631,
adopted in April 2019, which sets CO2 emission performance standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.

In 2021, the European Commission adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ("CSRD") in line
with the commitment made under the European Green Deal. The CSRD, as further implemented by the EU Member States,
amended the existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and will substantially increase reporting requirements
on the companies falling within its scope. With our application of the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 ("GRI 2021")
Standards and Disclosures that we use to report our sustainability-related data in a transparent and credible way, we believe
we are well prepared to meet CSRD's new reporting requirements.

In addition to our regulatory obligations, we leverage our quality, safety, and environmental certifications, which
we believe are an increasingly important factor in our customers' choice of rental partners. Our industrial, traffic services,
survey and laser and IQ-Pass brands are certified according to ISO 9001 standards. For Cramo entities in Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Estonia and Lithuania, we have been certified by ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. All entities in the
Netherlands and Germany have ISO 50001 certification. In addition, IQ-Pass is ISO 27001 certified. In the UK, we are
audited by SafeHire and have met the bronze level requirements for Fors. Our Dutch (100%) and Belgian (60%) divisions
are VCA certified for Safety, Health and Environment, and the Dutch divisions have the Safety Culture Ladder Step 2
certificate for safety awareness.

_Corporate Social Responsibility_

We believe that sustainability primarily means striving for a safe and environmentally friendly fleet with a low
climate impact. In addition, health, safety, well-being, diversity and social and ethical issues are among our top priorities.
Our sustainability policy is comprised of three major ambitions:

    - we aim to become the most climate- and resource-efficient rental solutions company;


-----

    - we aspire to lead the way in advancing sustainability in the rental industry; and

    - we strive to lead our company with high business ethics.

We believe that our value chain perspective on sustainability helps us identify how we can optimally manage our
impact on the environment while optimizing our business. We also strive to meet our customers' increasing needs and
demands for more sustainable solutions.

To help achieve our sustainability goals, we have implemented internal processes, including the establishment of
a sustainability steering committee (the "Sustainability Steering Committee"). As part of these processes, we engage with
and work towards material topics, focus areas, strategic targets and targets per focus area, all of which are approved and
monitored by our Sustainability Steering Committee.

Based on a formal GRI 2021 materiality assessment conducted in 2022, we have identified four focus areas:
customer care, employee care, environmental care and social care, each of which we describe below. Our strategic targets
for each of these focus areas for 2025, in each case using 2021 as a baseline, involve:

    - achieving 85% of units powered by electricity within our energy powered fleet;

    - developing a harmonized group-wide customer satisfaction methodology;

    - reaching a 10% reduction of lost time injury rate, representing the average number of injuries occurring
over one million working hours, ("LTIR") per year;

    - attaining an employee satisfaction index of 84%;

    - reaching a wellbeing and diversity score of 80%;

    - achieving a 20% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions (measured as tCO2/sales) (for the
year ended December 31, 2022, this amounted to 27.1 tCO2/sales, a decrease of 11% compared to 2021);

    - achieving a 15% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 energy use (measured as MWh/sales) (for the
year ended December 31, 2022, this amounted to €123 million per MWh, a decrease of 12% compared
to 2021);

    - increasing our share of renewable electricity use to above 92% (for the year ended December 31, 2022,
this amounted to 56%);

    - having over 75% of our group entities receiving a silver or higher rating from Ecovadis (relative to
revenue); and

    - reducing our exposure to legal proceedings pertaining to human rights, discrimination and sexual
harassment, environment and anti-corruption.

See "Risk Factors—Risks related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment—We are subject to risks related to
_environmental, social and governance matters, including the failure to meet certain of our targets."_

_Customer Care_

We believe that priority should always be given to our customers' sustainable operations. We strive to provide a
safe working environment at construction sites, digitalized solutions and high-quality rental equipment and services. We
also aim to help our customers minimize their climate impact by increasing circularity and offering an increased range of
resource-efficient and fossil fuel-free alternatives. Our focus in this respect therefore includes investing in modern, durable
and innovative technologies, in line with our aim to limit hazardous substances in our products and operations. Because of
our goals, we expect our suppliers and business partners to demonstrate similarly high ethical standards as ours.

We offer our customers a line of Eco-Label products, which currently consists of ecological alternatives to
commonly available fuel-powered machines. These sustainable options include either electric or battery driven products,
or products that have the capacity to significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions. We offer our Eco-Label products
to assist customers in lowering their environmental footprint at construction sites and events. Eco-Label products also
produce less noise and vibration and meet high standards for safety and user-friendliness.


-----

In addition to expanding our sustainable service offering, Boels Training and Cramo Schools offer safety trainings
every year to our customers. Customers' safety is a top priority, and training programs help us prevent accidents at
construction sites by increasing safety awareness and competence.

_Employee Care_

We strive to offer safe and healthy workplaces for our employees. Our ultimate goal is to significantly reduce,
and if possible, eliminate, the occurrence of accidents within our control across our operations. We are also committed to
treating our employees in an open, honest and equal way and strive to provide a diverse and inclusive culture, where all
employees of different ages, gender and backgrounds have the same opportunities for development. In 2023, we have
created the diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") team to oversee our DEI initiatives, such as our leadership and talent
programs. We believe our workforce should reflect the diversities of the communities in which we operate, and as such we
strive to operate an unbiased recruiting process, remain committed to principles of fair pay and aim to consistently provide
promotional opportunities. In addition, we value competence-based training and support career growth that encourages
employees to achieve their full potential.

We maintain confidential reporting channels for our employees throughout our organization and are in the process
of harmonizing procedures following the Cramo acquisition, including through our group-wide business code of conduct
which is now in place. In our Nordic regions where Cramo operates, we have a whistleblowing channel whereby any
concern or issue regarding a potential compliance violation may be reported and investigated in a confidential manner. In
Central Europe, we operate our "Trust Persons" program whereby employees can report misconduct and receive guidance,
support and advice. A whistleblowing channel for Central Europe is expected launch in the near future.

Finally, the safety of our employees is of critical importance to us, and we invest heavily in safety trainings and
policies. Safety is a recurring topic in management sessions and is monitored through audits, inspections and reviews. For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a LTIR of 16.2 and 17.4 injuries per one million working hours,
respectively.

_Environmental Care_

We continuously work to advance our capacities to mitigate our climate impact. In this respect, we focus on
finding ways to reduce our energy consumption, increase the use of renewable energy, and increase circularity of our
products across our operations. We also strive to use efficient logistics and transportation, reduce, reuse or recycle
materials, reduce waste, and handle hazardous waste properly. In terms of facilities, installations and vehicle fleet, we seek
to invest in energy-efficient products, services, and design for energy performance improvement.

_Social Care_

We strive to respect human rights throughout our entire value chain, and we support the Ten Principles of the
United Nations Global Compact, which we aim to incorporate throughout our business and processes. Furthermore, we
believe that an active collaboration with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders is key to the further development
of sustainable rental solutions. We therefore endeavor, where possible, to take an active role in the communities in which
we operate and encourage our employees to do the same, such as by donating to local charities.

**Insurance**

We maintain the types of insurance and the insured sums customary in our industry and countries of operation.
To ensure we retain the coverage appropriate for our international operations, we use the advice and services of a network
of international and local insurance brokers in the countries in which we operate.

Our group insurance portfolio consists of international insurance programs with major insurance providers,
supplemented locally in certain countries where we operate. It is comprised, in particular, of our automotive fleet insurance,
general liability insurance, property insurance, accident insurance and cybercrime insurance. This set of tailored insurance
policies includes coverage for, among other things, occupational accidents and injuries, equipment, real estate and other
property damage or loss, cyber risks, and employers, product, public as well as directors and officers' liability insurance.

We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to risks and sums insured for our business. Our
insurance portfolio is constantly reviewed for adequacy and adjusted if necessary. We have not had any material claims
that were not covered under our insurance policies.


-----

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to certain pending legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot estimate
with certainty our ultimate legal and financial responsibility or obligations with respect to such pending matters. See "Risk
_Factors—Risks related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment—We are exposed to various risks related to legal_
_proceedings or claims." Based on our examination of these matters and the provisions we have made, we believe that any_
ultimate liability we may have for such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_Set forth below is a summary of certain of our future significant debt arrangements. The following summary does_
_not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents. The_
_defined terms set forth in this section apply to this section only._

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

Boels Topholding B.V. as original borrower, original guarantor and company (the “Company”) is party to an
originally up to €1,788,000,000 senior facilities agreement (subsequently reduced to €1,629,300,000) originally dated
November 10, 2019 (as amended and restated from time to time including, most recently by the amendment and restatement
agreement dated June 15, 2021, the “Senior Facilities Agreement”) providing for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate
amount of €179,300,000 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a term loan facility in a principal aggregate amount of
€1,450,000,000 (“Facility B”) (the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility B are collectively referred to as the “Senior
**Facilities” for the purposes of this description).**

Facility B was fully drawn prior to the issue date and must be repaid in full on the termination date, being February
6, 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn by the Company and any additional borrowers which may accede to
the Senior Facilities Agreement subject to the conditions set out therein from February 6, 2020 (the “Closing Date”) up to
and including the date falling one month prior to the termination date. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the
date falling six years and six months after the Closing Date, being on or around August 6, 2026. The purpose of the
Revolving Credit Facility is to finance general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group including, without
limitation, financing permitted acquisitions and permitted joint ventures, financing distributions and dividends which are
permitted subject to compliance with a leverage ratio test and financing restructuring costs. The Revolving Credit Facility
may be used for the drawing of loans in euro, or by way of ancillary facilities (in any other currency as agreed between the
relevant ancillary lender and the Company) by the relevant lenders thereunder or an affiliate of such lenders. Any loan
made available under the Revolving Credit Facility shall (subject to the operation of customary rollover mechanics) be
repaid on the last day of its interest period and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid
on the termination date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility B, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes (in addition
to other permissions under the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability to incur additional indebtedness (including
under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or any additional notes
and/or other facilities or notes documented outside the Senior Facilities Agreement), provided that certain conditions are
met including (a) a €25,000,000 minimum amount for uncommitted facility commitments and (b) a pro forma incurrence
cap equal to the aggregate of: (i) the greater of (A) €205,400,000 and (B) an amount equal to 50 per cent. of Adjusted
EBITDA preceding the date of incurrence (after giving pro forma effect to the relevant transaction); plus (ii) an unlimited
amount at any time, where (A) Senior Secured Net Leverage (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) would not
exceed 3.54:1 where the relevant Financial Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) constitutes Senior
Facility Liabilities (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) or (B) in respect of Financial Indebtedness that does not
constitute Senior Facility Liabilities and, (I) is unsecured, Fixed Charge Cover (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) would not be less than 2.00:1; and (II) is secured by Permitted Security (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) on a junior-ranking basis on assets which are also encumbered by Transaction Security securing Senior Facility
Liabilities on a senior-ranking basis; and/or encumbering assets which are not subject to Transaction Security, Total Net
Leverage (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) would not exceed 4.83:1 or (C) solely in respect of acquisition
indebtedness (and including any available but undrawn commitments thereof), (I) Senior Secured Net Leverage (in respect
of Financial Indebtedness constituting Senior Facility Liabilities); or (II) Total Net Leverage and Fixed Charge Cover (in
respect of other Financial Indebtedness), would not be increased or decreased (as applicable) (each as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement), plus (iii) other than to the extent funded by long term financial indebtedness, the amount equal to
certain voluntary prepayments, permanent cancellations and repurchases by a member of the Group of the facilities incurred
under the Senior Facilities Agreement which constitutes a permitted debt purchase transaction thereunder, other permitted
facilities or notes incurred which are documented outside the Senior Facilities Agreement, together with all voluntary
prepayments of the revolving facilities incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement to the extent accompanied by a
permanent reduction in the corresponding commitments.

**_Ancillary facilities_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender (or an affiliate of a lender) may make available an ancillary facility
by way of an overdraft facility, a guarantee, bonding, documentary or stand-by letter of credit facility, a short term loan
facility, a derivatives facility, a foreign exchange facility, or any other facility or accommodation which is agreed by the
Company and the relevant ancillary lender, to a borrower in place of all or part of the respective lender’s unutilized
Revolving Credit Facility commitment.


-----

**_Interest and fees_**

The Senior Facilities bear interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus the applicable margin. The margin applicable to
the Senior Facilities is adjusted from time to time, subject to certain conditions (including but not limited to, if an event of
default under certain clauses has occurred and is continuing, the highest margin being payable) to a percentage rate per
annum determined in accordance with a Senior Secured Net Leverage related margin grid, such Senior Secured Net
Leverage as calculated and certified in each quarterly compliance certificate which is required to be delivered to the Agent.

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan made under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Default interest is 1.00% per annum higher than the interest rate that would otherwise be applicable
in respect of the unpaid amount.

We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee on the available but undrawn commitments under
the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the then applicable margin for the period commencing on the Closing
Date (February 6, 2020) and ending on the last day of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility
(July 6, 2026) being the date falling one month prior to the termination date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (or,
if earlier, the date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full).

We are not required to pay any commitment fees to a lender for so long as it is a defaulting lender.

We are also required to pay certain fees to the facility agent and the security agent in connection with the Senior
Facilities Agreement.

**_Guarantees and security_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by the Company, and certain other members of the Group (as
defined below) and is secured by the same Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in each case
subject to certain limitations due to applicable corporate law and contractual provisions. In addition, the Senior Facilities
Agreement currently benefits from residual pledges over the share capital of certain non-material subsidiaries in Austria,
Poland, Italy and the Czech Republic, and security over certain bank accounts and certain intercompany receivables of said
non-material subsidiary in the Czech Republic, that previously guaranteed the Senior Facilities Agreement, that will not
secure the Notes. The Issuer may seek majority lender consent pursuant to the terms of the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement to release such security at a future date.

The Senior Facilities Agreement further provides that the aggregate of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of the Company and all other guarantors with positive EBITDA (calculated on the same basis as EBITDA
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), before reallocation of intra-group items, in each case evidenced on the
basis of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (in this description of the
Senior Facilities Agreement, will be referred to as the “Group”)) must represent at least 80% of the aggregate EBITDA
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) of the Group (before reallocation of intra-group items) determined annually
on the basis of the audited consolidated annual financial statements of the Group but in each case excluding any members
of the Group incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction (as defined below) and members of the Group with negative EBITDA
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”). No breach of the Guarantor Coverage Test will occur if within the agreed accession
period, the Company procures that, subject to certain agreed security principles, additional members of the Group become
guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement such that if they had been guarantors under the Senior Facilities
Agreement on the reference date, the Guarantor Coverage Test would have been satisfied. The Guarantor Coverage Test
will be tested annually as per the end of each financial year of the Company. The agreed accession period is 120 days and
commences with the earlier of (i) receipt by the agent of the relevant annual financial statements and (ii) the date on which
the annual financial statements are due to be delivered. Additionally, the Company must procure that each member of the
Group which becomes, or any company acquired by a member of the Group which is, a Material Company (as defined in
the Senior Facilities Agreement) becomes a guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement and grants security as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within 120 days of such company becoming a Material Company, or, as the case
may be, being acquired.

“Excluded Jurisdiction” means Russia, Ukraine or any (other) Sanctioned Country (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement).

**_Voluntary cancellation and prepayment and mandatory prepayment_**

The Company may, if it gives the facility agent at least five business days prior written notice, cancel the whole
or, subject to a certain minimum cancellation amount, part of an available facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
Any such cancellation will reduce the commitments of the lenders under the affected facility ratably.


-----

Each borrower may voluntarily prepay all or, subject to a certain minimum repayment amount, part of a utilization
made available to it under the facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement by giving at least three business days prior
notice to the facility agent. Amounts prepaid in respect of Facility B under the Senior Facilities Agreement may not be
reborrowed as the relevant commitments will be irrevocably cancelled. Any prepayment shall be made with accrued
interest on the amount prepaid and, subject to breakage costs, without premium or penalty. Any such prepayment will be
shared pro rata across the lenders under the affected facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment and
cancellation of the Senior Facilities:

    - with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for such lender to perform
any of its obligations, or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any loan made available, under the
Senior Facilities Agreement (or it becomes unlawful for any affiliate of a lender for that lender to do so);
and

    - if a Change of Control or Sale (each as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) has occurred, with
respect to any lender that requires prepayment within a 30-business day offer period commencing on the
earlier of (i) the Company notifying the Agent of the event and (ii) the date on which the Lender becomes
aware of the event. Subject to the timely exercise of its rights within such offer period, each lender will
be entitled to require each borrower to repay such lender’s participation in any utilizations to that
borrower together with accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the finance
documents.

Following the election of any lender to have its participation in any utilizations prepaid and cancelled following a
Change of Control or Sale, the facility agent shall by not less than 30 days’ notice to the Company cancel the commitments
of that lender and declare the participation of that lender in all outstanding utilizations, together with accrued interest and
all other amounts accrued under the finance documents to that lender, immediately due and payable.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (where applicable), the Company must further ensure that
the borrowers prepay loans and cancel available commitments in amounts equal to the applicable percentage (determined
based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage) of certain disposal proceeds, listing process and excess cashflow to the extent
applicable and subject to further conditions.

**_Financial covenant_**

In respect of each quarter date, the Company is required to confirm whether or not the Total Net Leverage (each
as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) for the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters (subject
to certain provisions and adjustments) exceeds 6.58:1 (the “Financial Covenant”).

A breach of the Financial Covenant will be deemed cured if it is complied with when tested on the next quarter
date and no notice of acceleration has been provided to the Company under the Senior Facilities Agreement in respect of
that breach of the Financial Covenant prior to such quarter date.

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the Financial Covenant by electing to designate the
proceeds from any new equity of the Company and new shareholder loans received by the Company as a cure amount. The
Company may not make such election (i) more than four times during the life of the Senior Facilities Agreement (of which
no more than two times may be EBITDA cures), or (ii) in consecutive testing periods. Moreover, in each period of four
consecutive quarters there must be at least two quarters without a cure. A breach of the Financial Covenant may only be
cured if the relevant equity or shareholder loan is actually received by the Company no later than twenty (20) Business
Days after the date on which the relevant compliance certificate disclosing the breach was required to be delivered to the
facility agent.

**_Representations_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to certain specified
exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including (i) status, (ii) binding obligations,
(iii) non-conflict with other obligations, (iv) power and authority, (v) validity and admissibility in evidence, (vi) governing
law and enforcement, (vii) insolvency, (viii) no filings or stamp taxes, (ix) no deduction of tax, (x) no default, (xi) no breach

environmental laws, (xvi) taxation, (xvii) tax residence (xviii) ranking, (xix) good title to assets, (xx) legal and beneficial

representations will be repeated on the date of each utilization request, and on the first day of each interest period.

**_General undertakings_**

We are subject to certain restrictive and, as the case may be, affirmative covenants under the Senior Facilities
Agreement customary for these types of financing, which, in turn, are subject to certain specified exceptions and
qualifications (customized to our business and adjusted to our current credit standing). The Senior Facilities Agreement
will, in particular and without limitation, include restrictions and limitations (subject to exceptions, baskets and thresholds)
on:

    - Mergers, amalgamations, demergers, consolidations or other corporate reorganisations;

    - Acquisitions and joint ventures;

    - Disposals;

    - Change of business;

    - Making loans or extending credit;

    - Providing guarantees or indemnities;

    - Distributions, share redemption and payments on shareholder loans;

    - Financial indebtedness; and

    - Share capital.

**_Events of default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default that are customary for such types of financing
(subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods), including, without limitation: (i) non-payment of
amounts due under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the other finance documents, (ii) breach of the Financial Covenant,
(iii) breach of other obligations, (iv) misrepresentations, (v) cross default or cross acceleration, (vi) insolvency or
insolvency proceedings, (vii) creditor’s process, (viii) minimum share capital requirements of Italian obligors, (ix)
unlawfulness and invalidity, (x) repudiation and rescission of agreements, (xi) breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, (xii)
cessation of business, (xiii) audit qualification, (xiv) judgment, (xv) litigation, (xvi) expropriation and (xvii) occurrence of
a material adverse change. The occurrence of any such event of default would, subject to any applicable grace periods or
cure rights and agreed exceptions, entitle the facility agent (and the facility agent must do so if so directed by the Majority
Lenders) by notice to the Company to (among other things): cancel their commitments, declare that all or part of the loans
together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under the finance documents be immediately
due and payable and declare that all or any part of the amounts (including cash cover in respect of any outstanding amounts
under the ancillary facilities) is immediately due and payable or payable on demand.

**_Governing law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain of the Group’s creditors under the Group’s financing arrangements, the
Trustee and certain other parties will accede on or before the Issue Date to an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor
**Agreement”) originally entered into between the Security Agent, the senior agent, the lenders under the Existing Senior**
Facilities Agreement and others. The Intercreditor Agreement governs, inter alia, the relationships and relative priorities
among (i) the creditors and arrangers under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) the holders of the Notes and the


-----

Trustee; (iii) existing and future hedge counterparties under certain hedging agreements (the “Hedge Counterparties”);
(iv) certain shareholder loan creditors, third party security providers, intra-group lenders and debtors; (v) certain other
future creditors of the Group and/or such creditors representatives that may accede to the Intercreditor Agreement from
time to time in accordance with its terms; and (vi) the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions
of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description of certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement summarizes certain provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions
relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor
Agreement because it, and not the general overview that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the Notes.

Please note that certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement that are stated as applying generally to all types
of liabilities are subject to certain exceptions specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, certain provisions will
not apply to these exceptions. Such exceptions include but are not limited to cash cover provided under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement or any future senior facilities agreements (a “Permitted Senior Facilities Agreement”).

**_General_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, inter alia, sets out:

    - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness and liabilities of the Debtors;

    - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

    - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

    - the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated;

    - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of the transaction security;

    - turnover provisions;

    - the order for applying proceeds from enforcement action and other amounts received by the Security
Agent; and

    - when the transaction security and guarantees will be released to permit a disposal of the collateral.

For purposes of this description, “Senior Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other
debt instruments issued or to be issued which are designated by the Issuer as “Senior Notes” under the Intercreditor
Agreement. In this description, terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Ranking and priority_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Issuer and each
other member of the Group that accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time as a debtor under the Intercreditor
Agreement (together, the “Debtors”) and each Third Party Security Provider to the following parties shall rank in right and
priority of payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking Liabilities as follows:

_first, (i) the agents, the arrangers, the lenders, the issuing banks, the ancillary lenders and the security agent each_
in its capacity as creditor or as applicable creditor in respect of the parallel debt obligations in relation to liabilities under
the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement or any other Senior Finance Document (together, the “Senior Facility
**Liabilities”), (ii) the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other trustee in relation to the Senior Notes and the Senior**
Noteholders (the “Senior Notes Liabilities”) and (iii) the hedge counterparties under or in connection with the hedging
agreements relating to Senior Facility Liabilities and Senior Notes Liabilities (the “Senior Hedging Liabilities”) _pari_
_passu and without any preference between them. The Senior Facility Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities and the Senior_
Hedging Liabilities are together the “Senior Liabilities” and the creditors thereunder the “Senior Creditors” and

_second, (i) the agents, the arrangers, the lenders, the issuing banks, the ancillary lenders and the security agent_
each in its capacity as creditor or as applicable creditor in respect of the parallel debt obligations in relation to liabilities


-----

under the Junior Finance Documents (the “Junior Facility Liabilities”), (ii) the trustee(s) in relation to any Junior Notes,
the Security Agent and the Junior Noteholders (the “Junior Notes Liabilities”) and (iii) the hedge counterparties under or
in connection with the hedging agreements relating to Junior Facility Liabilities and Junior Notes Liabilities (the “Junior
**Hedging Liabilities”)** _pari passu and without any preference between them. The Junior Facility Liabilities, the Junior_
Notes Liabilities and the Junior Hedging Liabilities are together the “Junior Liabilities” and the creditors thereunder the
“Junior Creditors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities owed by one member of the Group to another
member of the Group (other than any Shareholder Liabilities (as defined below)) (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”) will be
postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the creditors under
the Senior Liabilities and Junior Liabilities, (together with the relevant creditor representatives, the Security Agent and any
receiver or delegate, the “Secured Parties”).

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the liabilities (“Shareholder Liabilities”) owed by any member
of the Group to a direct or indirect shareholder of the Issuer or any subsidiary of such (direct or indirect shareholder) of the
Issuer which is not a member of the Group under any loan made by it to the Issuer or any other member of the Group will
be postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured
Parties. The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank any of the Intra-Group Liabilities or the Shareholder
Liabilities as between themselves.

**_Transaction Security_**

The Secured Parties benefit from the transaction security. Subject to certain exceptions and to the order of
application of proceeds (see “—Application of proceeds” below), the transaction security shall rank and secure (but only
to the extent such transaction security is expressed to secure those liabilities) the liabilities owed to first, the Senior
Creditors _pari passu_ and without preference between them and second, the Junior Creditors _pari passu and without_
preference between them.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the guarantees and transaction security will be released in
certain circumstances described further below in “—Release of security—Non distressed disposals” and “—Release of
_security and guarantees—distressed disposals.”_

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted payments in respect of the Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Senior Facility Liabilities
and Senior Notes Liabilities (the creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Debt Creditors”), at any time in accordance
with the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture for the Notes and any other Senior Debt Document (as
applicable).

_Permitted payments in respect of the Junior Debt_

Prior to the date on which the Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged and the Senior Creditors
are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under the Debt Documents (the
“Senior Discharge Date”), the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Junior
Liabilities:

- if:

the payment is of

any of the principal amount of the Junior Liabilities in accordance with (in the case of the Junior Facility
Liabilities) the terms of the Junior Facility Agreements and (in the case of Junior Note
Liabilities) the terms of the Junior Note Documents:

i. relating to provisions which are equivalent to illegality, right of cancellation and repayment
in relation to a single lender or issuing bank under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement;

ii. non-distressed disposals or mandatory prepayment of proceeds contemplated by the
Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

iii. (only after the discharge in full of the Senior Debt Liabilities), relating to provisions which
are equivalent to the partial prepayment clause relating to excess cashflow of the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement; or

iv. any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Junior Note Liabilities which
is not prohibited from being paid by the Senior Finance Documents and the Senior Note
Documents; or

any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest such other amounts including
all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or liquidated
damages)) and default interest on the Junior Note Liabilities accrued and payable in cash in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Junior Note Documents (as at the date of issue of the
same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other
Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating
to the Junior Note Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the Junior Note
Indenture;

no junior payment stop notice is outstanding; and

no payment default in relation to the Senior Liabilities has occurred and is continuing;

- if the Majority Senior Creditors (as defined below) give prior consent to that payment being made;

- if

(a) an event of default has occurred under (in the case of the Junior Facility Liabilities) a Junior Facility
Agreement or (in the case of the Junior Note Liabilities) a Junior Note Indenture and is continuing and
the payment is (in the case of the Junior Facility Liabilities) of junior restructuring costs or (in the case
of the Junior Note Liabilities) of junior note restructuring costs, the common currency amount of which,
when aggregated with the common currency amount of any other such amounts paid, does not exceed
€2,500,000; and

(b) no payment default in relation to the Senior Liabilities has occurred and is continuing;

- if the payments are of costs, commissions, taxes and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to)
the Junior Note Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the relevant Junior
Note Documents);

- if the payments are of costs, commissions, taxes and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental
to) any refinancing of the Junior Notes in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Finance
Documents and the Senior Note Documents;

- if the payments are of Creditor Representative Amounts due and payable to the Junior Note Trustee, or

- if the payment is by the Issuer of any of its obligations under a Junior Note Indenture and such payment is not
directly or indirectly financed by any member of the Group except to the extent such payment would, if it had
been a payment by a Debtor (other than the Issuer) or other member of the Group to a Junior Note Creditor,
otherwise have been permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement.

On or after the Senior Discharge Date, the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments to the
Junior Creditors in respect of the Junior Liabilities in accordance with the Junior Finance Documents and the Junior Note
Documents, as applicable.

**_Enforcement regime_**

The enforcement regime set out in this section applies generally subject to certain exceptions.

_Instructing Group_

An “Instructing Group” means, subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, at any
time prior to the Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Debt Creditors and the Hedge Counterparties that are owed Senior
Hedging Liabilities (together, the “Senior Creditors”) representing more than 50% of the Senior Credit Participations (the
“Majority Senior Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_


-----

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the transaction security unless instructed otherwise by the
Instructing Group or, if they are entitled to give enforcement instructions in relation to the transaction security in accordance
with the paragraph below, the Majority Junior Creditors.

Subject to the transaction security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing Group
may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the transaction
security as they see fit; or, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if the Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent
not to enforce or to cease enforcing the transaction security or in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group,
and if, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the transaction security which the Majority
Junior Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent in certain circumstances and subject to the lapse of certain
time periods where applicable as further specified under the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of enforcement_

If the transaction security is being enforced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent shall enforce the relevant transaction security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection
of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be
appointed by the Security Agent) as the Instructing Group or any Junior Creditors entitled to give instructions pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent considers in
its discretion to be appropriate.

The Secured Parties shall not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the transaction
security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except through the
Security Agent.

_Turnover_

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the full and final
discharge of the Senior Liabilities and Junior Liabilities, any creditor under the Debt Documents receives or recovers from
any Debtor, member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x)
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of proceeds”;

(b) except with respect to certain set-off rights, any amount by way of set off which does not give effect to
a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) except with respect to certain set-off rights, any amount:

i. on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (A) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
transaction security (a “Distress Event”), or (B) as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a member of the Group or a Third Party Security Provider (other than
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that member of
the Group or Third Party Security Provider); or

ii. by way of set off in respect of any such liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a Distress
Event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of proceeds”;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the transaction security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of proceeds”; or

(e) except with respect to certain set-off rights, any distribution or payment of, or on account of or in relation
to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not
in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that member
of the Group or Third Party Security Provider, that creditor will:

i. in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set off:


-----

1. hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or, if less,
the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and

2. promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt
or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

ii. in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, promptly pay
an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

resolution is passed or order made for the winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation of that member of the
Group or Third Party Security Provider, a moratorium is declared in relation to any indebtedness of that member of the
Group or Third Party Security Provider or an administrator is appointed to that member of the Group or Third Party Security
Provider; (b) any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement is made with any of its creditors; (c) the
appointment of any liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer
in respect of that member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider or any of its assets; or (d) any analogous procedure
or step is taken in any jurisdiction.

**_Application of proceeds_**

_Order of application—Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and to the provisions described below, all
amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt Document or in
connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the transaction security shall be held by the Security
Agent on trust to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, in the following order of priority:

(a) in discharging any sums owed to the Security Agent (other than pursuant to the parallel debt provisions)
and any receiver or delegate and in payment to the Creditor Representatives of the relevant creditor
representative amounts;

Junior Finance Document or Junior Note Document, in payment or distribution to any person to whom


-----

the Security Agent is obliged to pay or distribute in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider; and

(a) the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the relevant Debtor or Third Party Security Provider.

**_Option to purchase_**

All the Junior Debt Creditors (acting as a whole), may, after a Distress Event and subject to various conditions set
out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the relevant lenders
or creditors and payment in relation to all losses incurred by certain other parties as a consequence of any sum received
and a simultaneous transfer of each Hedging Agreement with associated rights and obligations), require the transfer to them
(or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights and obligations in respect of the Senior Debt Liabilities at
par plus all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Senior Agent, the Senior Lenders, the relevant Senior
Note Trustee and the Senior Noteholders as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer.

**_Release of security—non distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where an asset of a member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider or an asset subject to
transaction security is to be disposed of to a person (or persons) outside the Group and which is not a Third Party Security
Provider and the Security Agent is notified that such disposal is permitted under the Senior Finance Documents, Senior
Note Documents, Junior Finance Documents and Junior Note Documents and that such disposal is not a distressed disposal,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized:

    - to release the transaction security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that asset;

    - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group or Third Party Security
Provider, to release the transaction security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that
member of the Group’s or Third Party Security Provider’s property; and

    - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the transaction security or any claim described in the
before mentioned paragraphs and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable.

**_Release of security and guarantees—distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where an appropriation or a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group or a Third Party
Security Provider is being effected (x) at the request of the Instructing Group in circumstances where the transaction
security has become enforceable, (y) by enforcement of the transaction security or (z) after the occurrence of a Distress
Event to a person or persons which is, or are, not a member, or members, of the Group (a “Distressed Disposal”), the
Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized:

    - to release the transaction security or any other claim over the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or
appropriation and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that transaction security or claim and
issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the
discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

    - if the asset that is disposed of or appropriated consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider, to release (i) that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider and any subsidiary of that
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities and certain other liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted by that Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider or any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider over any of its assets;
and (iii) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, or another Debtor or another Third Party Security
Provider over that Debtor’s or Third Party Security Provider’s assets or over the assets of any Subsidiary
of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider;

    - if the asset that is disposed of or appropriated consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of
a Debtor, to release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any
part of its borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and certain other liabilities, (ii) any transaction
security granted by any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (iii) any other
claim of an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor over the assets of any subsidiary of that holding
company;


-----

    - if the asset which is disposed of or appropriated consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding
company of a Debtor, to dispose of (i) all or any part of the Liabilities (other than liabilities due to the
Senior Agent, Senior Arrangers or any Senior Note Trustee), or (ii) intra-group receivables provided that
the transferee shall not be treated as a Senior Creditor, a Junior Creditor or a Secured Party under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

    - if the asset which is disposed of or appropriated consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding
company of a Debtor, to dispose of (i) the Liabilities (other than liabilities due to any Senior Agent,
Senior Arrangers or any Senior Note Trustee), or (ii) intra-group receivables, where the transferee of
such Liabilities shall become a Senior Creditor, a Junior Creditor or Secured Party provided that such
transfer is in respect of all (and not part only) of such Liabilities and/or intra-group receivables, as
appliable; and

    - if the asset which is disposed of or appropriated consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding
company of a Debtor, to transfer Intra-Group Liabilities or intra-group receivables owed by that Debtor
or holding company of a Debtor to another Debtor.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described
under “—Application of proceeds.”

**_Accession of New Intra-Group Lenders_**

If any Intra-Group Lender or any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider makes any loan to or
grants any credit to or makes any other financial arrangement having similar effect with any Debtor, in an aggregate amount
of €3,000,000 or more, the Issuer will procure that the person giving that loan, granting that credit or making that other
financial arrangement (if not already a party as an Intra-Group Lender) accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as an IntraGroup Lender.

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the facility agents, the Majority Senior Lenders, the Majority Senior Noteholders, the Majority
Junior Lenders, the Majority Junior Noteholders and the Security Agent. However, to the extent that an amendment, waiver
or consent in relation to certain equalisation provisions does not affect the Junior Creditors, those provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or waived, subject to certain exceptions, with the consent of the senior agent, the
Majority Senior Lenders, the Majority Senior Noteholders and the Security Agent.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to, among
other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of proceeds” above and the order of priority or subordination
under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the Facility Agents, the Senior Lenders,
each Senior Note Trustee on behalf of the Senior Noteholders in respect of which it is the Creditor Representative, the
Junior Lenders, each Junior Note Trustee on behalf of the Junior Noteholders in respect of which it is the Creditor
Representative, each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the Hedge
Counterparty) and the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions which can result in a party’s participation being deemed to be
zero for the purpose of calculating the percentage of necessary consents by the members of a relevant group in regard to
amendments and waivers if that party fails to respond to that request within ten business days of that consent request being
made or (in the case of a Senior Creditor, in relation to certain requests) fails to provide details of its participations to the
Security Agent within the period specified by the Security Agent..

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits (or in some cases, requires) the Security Agent (subject to the terms of
any credit facility) to enter into new or supplemental security if certain conditions are met, including in connection with
uncommitted facilities established under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law.

**Trade Receivables Purchase Program**

In June 2023, the Group entered into the Trade Receivables Purchase Program pursuant to which the Group sells
a portion of its accounts receivables from operating businesses in certain jurisdictions in return for funding. Receivables
are only eligible for sale if they meet certain criteria. As at June 30, 2023, €48.1 million in financing was outstanding under
the Trade Receivable Purchase Program (which may be increased to €75 million as permitted under the Trade Receivables
Purchase Program). The Trade Receivables Purchase Program is currently expected to be secured on a first priority basis
by certain collection accounts for trade receivables in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, that will not secure the
Notes. For further detail, see Note 4 of the HY 2023 Interim Financial Statements.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

In this "Description of the Notes," the term "Issuer" refers only to Boels Topholding B.V. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries, except for the purposes of financial data determined on a consolidated basis. The term "Notes," unless the
context requires otherwise, also refers to "book entry interests" in the Notes, as defined herein. The definitions of certain
other terms used in this description are set forth throughout the text or under "—Certain Definitions." The Issuer will issue
€400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the "Notes") under an indenture
dated on or about     , 2023 (the "Indenture") between the Issuer, the Guarantors, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee
Services Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, The Bank
of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch, as transfer agent and registrar, and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., as security
agent (the "Security Agent"), in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. **Securities Act"). The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the**
Indenture.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may in the future, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount
of Additional Notes (as defined below). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the
covenants contained in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Notes and the Indenture, and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. It does not, however, restate the Notes and the Indenture in their
entirety and where reference is made to a particular provision of the Notes or the Indenture, such reference, including the
definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in the future. The terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees. See the
section entitled "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

You should read the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they
contain additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as a Holder of the Notes. The
Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by reference to, and is not otherwise subject to, the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) thereof.

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the "Authority") for listing of
and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"). In the event
that the Notes are admitted to trading on an exchange other than the Exchange, references herein to the Exchange shall be
deemed to be to the relevant exchange upon which the Notes are listed. The Issuer can provide no assurance that this
application will be accepted. See "—Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar."

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

Each reference to a legal entity herein shall be deemed to include such entity's successor in interest, unless the
context requires otherwise.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

    - be the Issuer's general, senior obligations;

    - be secured as set forth under "—Security," on a pari passu basis with the interests granted in favor of the
Existing Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer's obligations under the
Existing Senior Facilities;


-----

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not secured by the
Collateral, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property or
assets securing such obligations;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors; and

    - be guaranteed on a senior joint and several basis by the Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed, as of the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors.

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor will:

    - be a general senior obligation of such Guarantor;

    - be secured as set forth under "—Security," on a pari passu basis with the interests granted in favor of the
Existing Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor
that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including such Guarantor's
obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are not
secured by the Collateral owned by such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by
property or assets that do not secure such Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property or assets
securing such other obligations;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that do not provide Guarantees, including obligations owed to trade creditors; and

    - be subject to the limitations described herein and in "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantees and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability" and "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and_
_the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

**_General_**

The Issuer is partially dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—The Issuer depends upon cash flow
_from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes and the Guarantees."_

Not all of the Issuer's direct and indirect Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 87% of our Reported EBITDA (excluding entities with
negative Reported EBITDA), 89% of our revenue and 92% of our total assets (including goodwill).

The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer's Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any right of the Issuer
to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of


-----

the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary's creditors, except
to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would
still be subordinated in right of payment to any security over the assets of the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary
senior to that held by the Issuer.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance or infringement of capital maintenance rules
under applicable law, otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or as set out in the respective Guarantee. By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability." The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to_
the limitations described in this Offering Memorandum under the caption "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries." Under the circumstances
described below under "—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries," the Issuer will
be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer
will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not
Guarantee the Notes.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial. The Indenture will
permit additional Debt to be secured.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on     , 2029 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The Issuer will issue
the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €400,000,000. Each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum of      %
and interest will be payable semi-annually on      and      of each year, commencing on     , 2024. Interest will be
payable to Holders of record on each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the Clearing System
Business Day immediately preceding the payment date, as the case may be; however, owners of beneficial interests in the
Notes must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely_
_on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies." If the due date for any payment in_
respect of the Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will
not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. The rights of Holders in beneficial
interest of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from, and including, the original issuance date or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons and only in denominations of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act ("Rule 144A") will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"), and Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act ("Regulation S") will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global
**Notes").**

The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in
the name of the nominee of such common depositary. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to in this
description as "book-entry interests," will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants.


-----

The terms of the Indenture will provide for the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in certain limited
circumstances.

See "Book-Entry; Delivery and Form."

**Transfer**

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described under
"Notice to Investors."

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Issuer, the Agents and/or the Trustee may require a Holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a Holder to pay any taxes
or other governmental charges payable in connection with the transfer or exchange. The Issuer will not be required to
transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or repurchase or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15
Business Days prior to any date on which all or any part of the Notes are to be redeemed or repurchased. The Notes will
be issued in registered form and the Holder will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. For further
information about transfer and exchange procedures, see the section titled "Book-Entry; Delivery and Form."

Book-entry interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

Book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of book-entry interests in the 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A) in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A.

Any book-entry interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a book-entry
interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to
all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in the Global Note to which it was
transferred.

All transfers of book-entry interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear
or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear
or Clearstream and their respective participants. See "Book-Entry; Delivery and Form."

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, at its office
or through its agent that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon,
London Branch (the "Paying Agent"). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent without prior notice to the Holders. The
Issuer will make all payments in same-day funds.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the "Registrar") and a transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"). The initial
Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch. The Registrar will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer
Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at the registered
office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the
Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail. The Registrar has no responsibility for any register
maintained by the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as they are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the
rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar
or Transfer Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any
Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer
to Euroclear and Clearstream.


-----

Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of
the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge
payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer's compliance with the covenants described under the headings "—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Debt" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens," the Issuer is permitted to issue_
additional Notes ("Additional Notes"), which shall have the terms set out in an Officer's Certificate supplied to the Trustee.
The Notes (together with any Additional Notes of such series issued from time to time) will constitute separate series of
Notes, but will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with
respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. In the Issuer's
sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer's Certificate may include, among others, provisions pertaining to (a) the
redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any special mandatory
redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Notes are
deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such
redemption, a "Special Mandatory Redemption"), (b) the escrow of all or a portion of the proceeds of such Additional
Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (y) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" in favor of the Trustee or a
security agent for the benefit of the holders of such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit
of the holders of any other Notes, including Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary
authorizations for the Trustee or such security agent to enter into such arrangements; provided that, for so long as the
proceeds of such Additional Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not
be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security
interest in the Collateral and (c) the maturity date, interest rate (which may be fixed or floating), interest payment dates and
related record dates, currency, clearing system and denominations for such Additional Notes, it being understood that, with
respect to the Additional Notes, all references to currency (including any government obligations related thereto) and
denominations herein shall mean the currencies (including any government obligations related thereto) and denominations
applicable to such Additional Notes. In addition, such Officer's Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such
Additional Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, such as the consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional
Notes bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Notes
bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code as any existing Notes issued. Unless the context otherwise requires, for
all purposes of the Indenture and this "Description of the Notes," references to "Notes" shall be deemed to include references
to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be
of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have
terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with other
series (including, if applicable, the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date) (it being understood that any Additional Notes
that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other series of Notes but for being subject to a Special
Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration
of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors. Under the Indenture, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Guarantors will jointly and severally agree to guarantee the due and punctual payment of all
amounts payable under the Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest payable under the Notes.

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt
and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary of the
Issuer. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any
other Guarantor, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged
and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor to
a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted


-----

Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenants described under the caption
_"—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales" or "—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or_
_Sale of Assets;"_

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of the Guarantor (or Capital Stock
of any Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a
Holding Company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described
under the caption "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales" and as a result of such disposition
such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(3) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions under
"—Defeasance" or "—Satisfaction and Discharge;"

(4) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing;

(6) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction
permitted by "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets—Guarantors;"

(8) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
_of Debt," the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the_
obligation to guarantee the Notes and such Restricted Subsidiary is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor pursuant to the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
_of Debt;"_

(9) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers;"

(10) upon (or substantially concurrently with) the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other
obligations of such Guarantor under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement or any credit facility that
replaces or refinances the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (other than a release and discharge of the
Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor in connection with the repayment in full or
refinancing in full of the Existing Senior Facilities or such other credit facility); or

(11) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
on an enforcement sale or other disposal of such Guarantor, or in connection with an IPO Pushdown.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee shall (at the cost of
the Issuer) execute, subject to the receipt of an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel from the Issuer, any
documents reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such
Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be
effected without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**_Limitations on the value of the Guarantees_**

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being
voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent
conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and applicable
to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. The obligations to provide Guarantees will also be subject to the
operation of the Agreed Security Principles. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our
_Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_
_by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability" and "Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_


-----

**_Additional Amounts_**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or similar
governmental charges (collectively, "Taxes") imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any jurisdiction in
which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in a business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes, or from
or through which payment on the Notes or the Guarantees is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, or any political subdivision
or authority thereof or therein, having the power to tax (each, a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor is required to so withhold or
deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be,
will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received after such
withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount that would have been received if such Taxes had not been
required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a Holder of
any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of a present or former
connection of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such
beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership or corporation) with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,
citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a
place of business or a place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) other than the mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments
under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the
case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) of any Note,
to comply with the Issuer's written request addressed to the Holder, providing at least 30 calendar days'
notice, to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which the Holder or
such beneficial owner is legally required to satisfy, whether imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is
not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, provided that the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is
legally entitled to satisfy such requirements;

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect
to any Note or Guarantee;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is required
in order to receive payment) by the Holder for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on
which such payment becomes due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided
for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to such
Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such
30-day period;

(f) any Tax imposed or withheld pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021),
as amended, on payments due to a Holder of the Notes affiliated (gelieerd) to the Issuer (within the
meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 as at the date of this Offering Memorandum;

(g) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471-1474 of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any current or future regulations or
official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any
agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code;


-----

(h) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair
Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb), as
amended or replaced from time to time;

(i) any German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) and
church tax (Kirchensteuer), if any, thereon, levied in Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent
acting on behalf of the Holder; or

(j) any Taxes that were imposed with respect to any payment on a Note to any fiduciary or partnership or
person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that no Additional Amounts
would have been payable had the beneficial owner of the applicable Note been the holder of such Note.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect of any
combination of the above items.

The Issuer or Guarantors will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and remit
the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all applicable laws.
The Issuer will, upon request, make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or Guarantors or if, notwithstanding the Issuer's reasonable efforts to obtain
such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment by the
Issuer or Guarantors.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor becomes aware that it will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment
under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or Guarantor
will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee or Paying
Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

In addition, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer,
documentation, court, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest or penalties with respect thereto
imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in respect of the execution, issue, delivery or registration of the
Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than transfers of
the Notes following the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers); and (ii) any such taxes, charges or duties
imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, Guarantees or any other
such document or instrument during or following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person to the Issuer or_
a Guarantor is organized, engaged in significant operations or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or
taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in the Indenture or this "Description of the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
principal (and premiums, if any), Redemption Price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note
(including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts thereon.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and applicable perfection requirements, the
Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by:

- the issued shares, certain material bank accounts and material structural intercompany receivables of the Issuer;

- material structural intercompany receivables owed to Holdco by the Issuer or any material subsidiary;

- the issued shares, certain material bank accounts and certain material structural intercompany receivables of the
Guarantors; and


-----

- substantially all assets of each Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales, substantially all inventory, machinery,
plant, trade receivables, vehicles and construction machines of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (in each
case, by way of a floating charge) and substantially all movable assets of each Guarantor incorporated in Finland
and Sweden (by way of a business mortgage)

(collectively, the "Collateral").

The Existing Senior Facilities currently benefit from residual pledges over the share capital of certain non-material
subsidiaries in Austria, Poland, Italy and the Czech Republic that previously guaranteed the Existing Senior Facilities as
well as security over certain bank accounts and certain intercompany receivables of said non-material subsidiary in the
Czech Republic, that will not secure the Notes. The Issuer may seek majority lender consent pursuant to the terms of the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement to release such security at a future date.

The Collateral will also include any other additional security interests that may in the future be created to secure
obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief
description of such limitations, see "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

**_Priority_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will act on behalf of, and the Collateral will be shared
equally and ratably among (but without prejudice to the agreed order of application of proceeds following the enforcement
thereof), the Notes, obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities, obligations under certain Hedging Obligations, if any
and certain other Debt permitted to be secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture. See "Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the_
_Guarantees and Our Structure." In addition, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to create, incur,_
assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist other Permitted Collateral Liens as provided for under the caption "—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens." Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Debt secured by the_
Collateral could be significant.

References to pari passu security interests include security interests that were created subsequent in time and thus
in ranking, but are contractually pari passu with prior ranking security and entitled to equal treatment with other prior
ranking security and secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Holders of the Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor_
_Agreement to implement parity among the secured parties."_

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Security and the Note Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure (including by virtue of a
parallel debt arrangement set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement) the payment, when due, of the Issuer's and the
Guarantors' payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, which also secures the Issuer's and the
Guarantors' payment obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, if any. When
entering into, confirming or extending the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name but for the
benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time), unless otherwise
required in accordance with applicable law with respect to each relevant Security Interest and, in the case of certain
accessory security interests, as creditor under the parallel debt arrangement. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only
the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a


-----

consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain
circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These
limitations are described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" and "Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests." See also "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Holders of the Notes_
_may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral." The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar_
arrangements in relation to future Debt that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under "—Release of Security." The
validity and enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral" and "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

In the event that Holdco, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security
Documents. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure."

The Indenture permits, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under the
caption "—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens," the
Collateral to be charged in connection with future incurrences of Debt, including any Additional Notes and Debt of
Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

(1) At the option of the Issuer, on, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a "Pushdown Notice")) that the terms of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the "Pushdown Date")) on the basis that (unless otherwise set out in
the Pushdown Notice):

Agreement) to the Issuer or a holding company of the Issuer or a holding company of the IPO Entity
performing a particular role or acting in a particular capacity shall (unless specified otherwise in the
Pushdown Notice) be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the
context requires otherwise, and provided that nothing in this paragraph (1), including the deeming
construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (c) and any action taken by the IPO Entity prior to such
designation, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
covenant or other term in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement), the Security Documents or a Default or an Event of Default);

(d) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security
Documents or otherwise shall apply to any Person of which the IPO Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in
its capacity as a Guarantor, third party security provider or otherwise);


-----

(e) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor, third party security provider or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly
or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Documents or a
Default or an Event of Default ;

(f) the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be (and will be deemed to have been) novated or
otherwise transferred to the IPO Entity (or, subject to paragraph (c) below, to a Restricted Subsidiary of
the IPO Entity);

(g) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under and in connection with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Documents and any security granted by it or any holding company
of it;

(h) each holding company of the IPO Entity, will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving pro forma effect
thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany receivables) that are, in
the Issuer's reasonable determination, material to, or reasonably necessary for the operations of, the
business of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

(i) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and which is a holding company of the IPO Entity shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Issuer that person shall cease to
be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and shall have no
further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement)); (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any such holding company to become
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); and (C) any term of
the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any
other agreement which requires or assumes that such holding company be a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement or that any liabilities or obligations be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or amendment
to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security
Documents or any other agreement or instrument requested by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is
requested by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) above,
provided that, in the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, such amendment, replacement or other
document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee and/or the Security Agent or, in
the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, does not affect the rights, duties, powers,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, under such
amendment, replacement, release or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each
irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such
amendment or replacement documents and/or take such other action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on
the request of and at the cost of the Issuer).

(3) If a Pushdown Notice is delivered to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (1) above in relation to a contemplated
Initial Public Offering, the Issuer shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the
occurrence of the relevant Initial Public Offering by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown
Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (3): (i) the provisions of paragraph (1) above shall cease to
apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (1) above
in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Security Agent by prior written notice to the Issuer and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as
reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as "Shareholder Loan Creditor"
and "Third Party Security Provider" or equivalent term has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement
pursuant to paragraph (1) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written
notice to the Issuer and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a "Shareholder Loan Creditor" and "Third Party
Security Provider" or equivalent term.


-----

(4) For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (3) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from
delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated Initial Public Offering; and (B)
revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or any Security Documents or any other document or
instrument or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or
any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

(5) For the purpose of this covenant and the Indenture, the "IPO Entity" shall be the Issuer, any Guarantor or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or any successor of any such Person) as notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as
the Person to be treated as the IPO Entity in relation to the relevant Initial Public Offering, provided that the IPO
Entity shall be an entity which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a
holding company thereof).

**_Release of Security_**

The Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged
and be of no further force and effect):

(1)

(a) subject to clause (b) below, in connection with any sale or disposition or transfer of Collateral to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption
"—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales;"

(b) any release of the Security Interest in respect of the Capital Stock of the Issuer pursuant to clause 1(a)
shall only be permitted if such Capital Stock is subject to a Lien of at least equivalent ranking (in the
good faith judgment of the Issuer) in favor of the Holders of the Notes as soon as reasonably
practicable after such release;

(2) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes that complies with the provisions under "—
_Defeasance" or "—Satisfaction and Discharge;"_

(3) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers" or "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens;"

(4) in the case of property and assets and Capital Stock of a Guarantor and intercompany receivables claims
against such Guarantor, to the extent such Guarantor is released from its Guarantee of the Notes pursuant
to the terms of the Indenture;

(5) to the extent permitted in accordance with the covenant described under the caption "—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" below;_

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture (to the extent of such Restricted Subsidiary's assets and property,
and the Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary and intercompany receivables claims against such
Restricted Subsidiary);

(7) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(8) upon (or substantially concurrently with) the release of the Lien granted in favor of (a) the Existing Senior
Facilities or any credit facility that replaces or refinances the Existing Senior Facilities (other than a
release of such Lien in connection with the repayment in full or refinancing in full of the Existing Senior
Facilities or such other credit facility) or (b) such other Debt that gave rise to the obligation to grant the
Lien over such Collateral;

(9) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), including
on an enforcement sale or other disposal of such assets or in connection with an IPO Pushdown;

(10) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction
permitted by "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;"


-----

(11) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the
sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a
Qualified Securitization Financing; or

(12) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

Each of the releases set forth above may be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders of
the Notes. The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral shall, if requested by the Issuer, be evidenced
by the Security Agent. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall (at the cost and request of the Issuer) take all necessary
actions to effectuate the releases described above, subject to customary protections and/or indemnifications.

**Optional Redemption**

**_General_**

Any redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent
(including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity
Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the Notes, the incurrence of indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used
to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
notice of redemption shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied, provided, however, that, in any case such redemption date shall not be more than
60 days from the date on which such notice is first given, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed.

In the case of any partial redemption, unless otherwise required by law, the Notes to be redeemed will be selected
in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in
compliance with the applicable procedures and requirements of the relevant clearing system(s), or, if the Notes are not
listed, and the relevant clearing system(s) have no such procedures or requirements, then on a pro rata basis, although no
Note of €100,000 in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part, and only Notes in integral multiples of
€1,000 will be redeemed. The Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for any selection made under this
paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof
will be issued and delivered in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

The Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, the Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to
one or more of the relevant provisions of the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to
redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions will have different redemption dates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Excess Proceeds Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
Holders, all of the Holders of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer, and accordingly the Issuer or
such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive
fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption prior to     , 2025 upon Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to     , 2025, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Issuer may on any one
or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued under
the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) at a redemption price of      % of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption


-----

date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), with the net proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued (calculated
after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) would remain outstanding immediately after
the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

**_Optional Redemption prior to     , 2025_**

At any time prior to     , 2025, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Issuer may also redeem
all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Redemption
Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date (subject
to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date).

At any time prior to     , 2025, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Issuer may on any one
or more occasions redeem, during each 12-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes), at a redemption price of 103.000% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption on or after     , 2025_**

At any time on or after     , 2025 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice,
the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be at the following redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning      in each of the
years set forth below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2025 ................................................................................................................................... %
2026 ................................................................................................................................... %
2027 and thereafter ............................................................................................................ 100.000%

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together
with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if the Issuer determines in good faith that the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next date on which any amount would
be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as defined above under "—Guarantees—
_Additional Amounts") in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, which the_
Issuer or Guarantor cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a
Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction and, in the case of a Guarantor, making the payment giving rise to such
requirement through another Guarantor who would not be obligated to pay Additional Amounts if payments through
another Guarantor would be reasonable), as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under "—Guarantees—Additional
_Amounts") affecting taxation which is enacted or issued and becomes effective on or after the date of the_
Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing Jurisdictions have changed since the date of the Indenture, on or
after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under
the Indenture; or

(b) any change in the official written position regarding the application, administration, or interpretation of
the laws, treaties, regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the


-----

Relevant Taxing Jurisdictions have changed since the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which
such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (each of
the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a "Change in Tax Law").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or
withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, sending of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer's Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have been
satisfied (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer
or Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor,
as the case may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in
Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept, and is entitled to rely on, such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence,
without further enquiry, of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor person_
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Notice of Optional Redemption_**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules and regulations
of the Authority so require, any notice of redemption to the Holders shall be published to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules and regulations of the Authority and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the
Authority of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding. In addition to such publication, and to the extent
and in the manner so required by the rules of the Authority, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption
date, the Issuer will send such notice to Holders, except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture. For Notes which are represented by Global Notes, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to
Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account Holders. The Notes will be selected in accordance with
the methods described under "—Optional Redemption—General."

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under
the captions "—Certain Covenants—Change of Control" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales." The Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise, at
such price and on such terms as they see fit.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee or in
any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for, contingently
or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to "Incur" or, as appropriate, an "Incurrence") any
Debt (including any Acquired Debt); provided, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to
Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if on the date on which such additional Debt is Incurred, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Incurrence of such Debt (including the pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (a) the_


-----

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00; or (b) to the extent such Debt is Senior
Secured Debt, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would have been no more than 3.75 to 1.00;
and

(2) This "Limitation on Debt" covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):

(a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit Facilities in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(i) €1,350.0 million; plus

(ii) the greater of €305.0 million and 55% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(iii) the greater of €552.5 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(iv) in the case of any refinancing of any Debt Incurred under this clause, the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest, and any fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(b) (i) the Incurrence by the Issuer of Debt represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and
(ii) the Incurrence of Debt by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantees (other than Guarantees of any
Additional Notes) and any related "parallel debt" obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(c) any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date (other than Debt
Incurred under clauses (a) or (b) of this paragraph (2));

(d) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt between the Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that:

(i) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Debt and, if the aggregate principal amount
of such Debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor exceeds €10.0 million (other than Debt that
represents intra-group cash pooling or other cash management transactions in the ordinary
course of business) and the lender of such Debt is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, to the extent
required under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, it is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or
otherwise) and the performance in full of its obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as the
case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a disposition,
pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any transaction pursuant to
which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing from the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case, be deemed to be an Incurrence
of such Debt not permitted by this clause (d);

(e) (i) without limiting the covenant described under "—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt," the
guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this "Limitation on Debt"
covenant; _provided that if the Debt being guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes, then the_
guarantee shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Debt guaranteed;

(i) without limiting the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens," Debt arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Debt is not prohibited under the terms of the
Indenture;

(f) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt (A) represented by Capitalized Lease
Obligations, mortgage financings, purchase money obligations or other Debt Incurred or assumed in
connection with the acquisition, lease, rental, development or improvement of real or personal, movable
or immovable, property or assets, in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all
or any part of the purchase price, lease expense or cost of design, construction, installation or
improvement of property, plant, equipment or other assets used or useful in a Permitted Business
(including any reasonable related fees or expenses Incurred in connection with such acquisition, lease,


-----

rental, development or improvement); _provided that the principal amount of such Debt so Incurred_
outside the ordinary course of business, when aggregated with such other Debt previously Incurred
outside the ordinary course of business, in reliance on this clause (f)(A) and still outstanding shall not in
the aggregate exceed the greater of €222.5 million and 40% of Consolidated EBITDA or (B) represented
by Operating Leases or arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions and Permitted Refinancing Debt
in respect thereof;

(g) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising from agreements providing for
guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of earn-outs, deferred consideration or other purchase
price adjustments or any vendor financing or similar arrangements in connection with the acquisition or
disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of Capital Stock, other than guarantees or
similar credit support given by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt for borrowed money
Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such assets from the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that, in the case of a disposition, the
maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (g) will at no
time exceed the gross proceeds, including non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash

Notes and to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any material respect than the
original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(e) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar transfers

performance by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of, obligations under any future
amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue
Date shall only be permitted by this clause (i) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new
agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer) to the Holders when taken as a whole;

(j) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary solely (x) because
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock in such Person, (y) because the Issuer or a

any of its Subsidiaries or any of its direct or indirect parent companies, so long as such transaction is with

favorably than all other holders of such Debt or equity interests generally;

(p) (i) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such

Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause
(1)(a) above; and

such declaration arising under Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code or, in each case, its equivalent
in any other jurisdiction

**_Limitation on Liens_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to
exist any Lien on any of its property or assets, whether owned on the date of the Indenture or thereafter acquired,
securing any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (the "Initial Lien"), unless (a) in the case of any
property or assets that does not constitute Collateral, (i) such Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously
therewith effective provision is made to secure the Notes and the Indenture (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) or, in respect of Liens on property or assets of any Guarantor, such Guarantee thereof, equally and
ratably with (or, in the case of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor on a senior basis to) such Debt for
so long as such Debt is so secured by such Initial Lien and (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute
Collateral, such Lien is a Permitted Collateral Lien.

(2) Any such Lien created as a result of this covenant "Limitation on Liens" in favor of the Notes or any such
Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge
of the Initial Lien to which it relates or (ii) as set forth under the caption "—Security."

(3) With respect to any Lien securing Debt that was permitted to secure such Debt at the time of the Incurrence of
such Debt, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Debt. The "Increased
**Amount" of any Debt shall mean any increase in the amount of such Debt in connection with any accrual of**
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of


-----

interest in the form of additional Debt, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases
in the amount of Debt outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Debt.

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each
Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder's Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal amount of €100,000 or in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control Purchase Date").

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer, with
a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing in the register on such
date, which notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business
Day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent, or such later date as
is necessary to comply with any requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act or any other applicable
securities laws or regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on
such date;

(e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to
withdraw such acceptance.

(3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of
Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee (or an authenticating
agent) will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased
portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of Definitive
Registered Notes; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral_
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer
on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the Notes
have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under "Optional Redemption" or
(ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the times
applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any
(subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date), and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such tender offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such
Note would remain outstanding following such purchase.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities
laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of
such conflict.


-----

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules and regulations
of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of
Control Offer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could lead to a mandatory prepayment
and cancellation of all amounts and facilities under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. The Issuer's future debt and
the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be
repurchased. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain Debt, including the Existing
Senior Facilities and require a mandatory prepayment of such Debt under such agreement may not constitute a Change of
Control under the Indenture. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of
the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and any such
future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors
of such repurchase. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change
of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The provisions of the Indenture will
not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain transactions including a
reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such
transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those described under "—Limitation on Debt." The existence, however,
of a Holder of the Notes' right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon a Change of Control may deter
a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of Control.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available
funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders of the
Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of any other debt
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer
were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable
to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control
Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure would
result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes the rights described under "—Events
_of Default." An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, may result in a cross-default under certain of the_
financing arrangements described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements," including under the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement.

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
"substantially all," there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of
"all or substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes. See "—Amendments and Waivers" below.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(b) to the extent such Asset Sale has a purchase price in excess of the greater of €57.5 million and 10.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives
in respect of such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 180 days of
such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Sale);


-----

(ii) Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash or
Cash Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations
received in consideration of such Asset Sale);

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Issuer's Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, if the Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale; _provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such_
Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time of
receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (v), less
the amount of Net Cash Proceeds previously realized in cash from prior Designated Non-cash
Consideration does not exceed (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value) the greater of €85.0 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in the
aggregate outstanding at any time;

(vi) consideration consisting of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received from
Persons other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such Debt is not
Subordinated Debt and it has been or upon, consummation of the Asset Sale will be,
extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary; or

(vii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vi).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset Sale,
within 365 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or any such Restricted
Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net Cash Proceeds are so used
within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period), may be used by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant described
under "—Limitation on Debt," that is secured by the Collateral on a basis pari passu with or in priority
to the Notes and is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee, provided,
however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or repurchase of Debt pursuant to this
clause (i), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Debt and will cause the related
commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Debt including, but not limited to, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid or repurchased; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Debt that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Debt or Debt that is owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary); (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem _Pari Passu Debt secured by a Lien on the_
Collateral at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Debt plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that if
such Debt is Public Debt, the Issuer shall redeem, repay, repurchase or redeem any such Pari Passu Debt
pursuant to this clause (iii) only if the Issuer makes an offer to the Holders of the Notes to purchase their
Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Excess Proceeds Offer on a ratable basis
with any such Pari Passu Debt repaid pursuant to this clause (iii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an
Excess Proceeds Offer for purposes hereof); (iv) to make (at such time or subsequently in compliance
with this covenant) an offer to the Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Excess Proceeds Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Excess
Proceeds Offer for purposes hereof), or (v) to redeem, in whole or in part, any series of Notes as described
under "Optional Redemption;"

(b) to make capital expenditures or to invest in any Replacement Assets (including by means of capital
expenditure by, or an investment in Replacement Assets by, a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal
to some or all of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); or

(c) to do any combination of the foregoing.


-----

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds actually received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary but not so
used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes "Excess Proceeds." Pending the final application of any such
Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net
Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €100.0 million and 18% of Consolidated
EBITDA in a single transaction, the Issuer will, within 30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an "Excess
**Proceeds Offer") from all Holders of Notes and, at the Issuer's election, from the holders of any Pari Passu Debt,**
to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount, in the case of
the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of the
Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer
price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the
case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note being repurchased and (solely in the case of Pari
_Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu_
Debt being redeemed or repurchased, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an
Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use the amount of
such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt, if any, for general corporate purposes that
are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based upon the
principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered
and not withdrawn by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari Passu Debt,
at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 10 days and not later than 60 days from the date the
notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such Holders, or such later date as may be required under the U.S.
Exchange Act. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such Note
would remain outstanding following such purchase.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer
rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable
securities exchange on which Notes are then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of this "Limitation on Asset Sales" covenant, the Issuer will comply with
such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this
"Limitation on Asset Sales" covenant by virtue thereof.

(5) The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt_**

(1) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of
any Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor outstanding under any Credit Facility having an aggregate principal
amount outstanding that is greater than €10.0 million Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant described under
"—Limitation on Debt" or any other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless such
Restricted Subsidiary either (i) is not a Significant Subsidiary and, in respect of any Debt outstanding under the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (as may be refinanced, amended or restated from time to time) only, has not
become a Guarantor under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement; or (ii) executes and delivers within 30 days
a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such other Debt; and with respect to any guarantee of
Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted
Subsidiary's Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is
subordinated to the Notes. Any Guarantee of payment of the Notes may contain limitations on Guarantor liability
to the extent reasonably necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law or regulation.


-----

(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
existing on the Issue Date or that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee
was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

(3) Any Guarantee of the Notes granted pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant
may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged on the terms
and conditions and in the circumstances described under the heading "—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees."
A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release
there is no Debt of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have
been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated
as a Guarantor as at that date. At the cost and reasonable request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary
actions to effectuate any release of any Guarantee of the Notes in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee
the Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security
Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or to the extent such
Guarantee would reasonably be expected (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to give rise to or result in
(a) any conflict with or violation of applicable law, rule, regulation or order; (b) any risk of liability (civil, criminal,
administrative or other) for the officers, directors, shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary; or
(c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable
guarantee or similar fee payable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable expenses and
other than reasonable governmental expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings
required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant undertaken in connection
with, such Guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock
or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (ii) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Debt Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the "Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries"
covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement and related guarantees and security;

(b) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt permitted to be Incurred under Credit Facilities or any

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer's Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly established
Subsidiaries) to cease to be a "Restricted Subsidiary" and instead to be an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation;

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant (and
may classify such amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments and
Permitted Investments and ability to make payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under
the "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant as it sees fit) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the
net book value of the Issuer's interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS and (ii) the
Fair Market Value of the Issuer's interest in such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in
good faith); and

(c) the Issuer would be permitted under the Indenture to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to
the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the "Limitation on Debt" covenant at the time of such designation
(assuming the effectiveness of such designation).

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment constituting a
Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment and/or Permitted Investment pursuant to the "Limitation on Restricted
_Payments" covenant for all purposes of the Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value_
of the Issuer's interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the
Issuer's interest in such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith), and may classify such
amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments and/or Permitted Investments and


-----

permissions to make payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under the "Limitation on Restricted
_Payments" covenant as it sees fit._

(3) The Issuer's Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur and be
continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) unless such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not have any Debt outstanding (other than Debt that
would be Permitted Debt), after giving effect to such proposed designation, (x) the Issuer could Incur at
least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the "Limitation on Debt"
covenant or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such designation, in each case, on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation.

(4) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer's Board of Directors
will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer's Board of Directors with the Trustee giving
effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing
conditions, and giving the effective date of such designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within
60 days after the end of the Issuer's fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation
made during the fourth fiscal quarter of the Issuer's fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

(1) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) within 120 days following the end of each fiscal year beginning with the first fiscal year of the Reporting
Entity (as defined below) ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable,
the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Reporting Entity as of the end
of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of the Reporting Entity for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete notes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (c) a description of
the business of the Issuer; and (d) a description of management and shareholders, material debt
instruments, material affiliate transactions, material risk factors and material subsequent events; provided
that the information in clause (d) may be provided in the notes to the audited financial statements;

(b) within 60 days following the end of the first and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Reporting
Entity and within 75 days following the end of the second fiscal quarter in each fiscal year of the
Reporting Entity, beginning with the first fiscal quarter commencing after the Issue Date, quarterly
reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) quarterly financial information
of the Reporting Entity on a consolidated basis as of and for the period from the beginning of the relevant
quarter, to the close of the relevant quarter, together with comparable information for the corresponding
fiscal quarter period of the preceding year, and (b) an operating and financial review of the financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and material changes
in liquidity and financial capital resources of the Reporting Entity; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, any change of the
Chief Executive Officer of the Group or the Chief Financial Officer of the Group or a change in auditors
of the Group or any other material event, in each case, that the Reporting Entity announces publicly, a
report containing a description of such event.

(2) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

(3) At any time that any of the Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary
or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then
the periodic financial information required by the first paragraph of this "Reports to Holders" covenant will
include a separate reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.


-----

(4) Following an Initial Public Offering and/or listing of the equity interests of the IPO Entity on a regulated stock
exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies
with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange and, to the extent, the IPO Entity is different than the
Issuer and material differences exist between the assets, results of operations or financial condition of the IPO
Entity and the Issuer, the financial information is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of material
differences between the financial information relating to such IPO Entity and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the financial information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Upon complying with
the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, and provided that such requirements require the
IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports and semi-annual reports, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions of paragraph (1) above.

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee, the
Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information referenced in clauses (1)(a),
(b) and (c) and (3) above or alternatively, in the preceding paragraph, has been posted on the Issuer's website.

(6) The Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the first paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding
consolidated financial information of one of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Parent (any such entity that
provides such financial statements, information or other documents, the "Reporting Entity"); provided that, if
material differences exist between the assets, results of operations or financial condition of the Reporting Entity
and the Issuer, such financial information is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of material
differences between the financial information relating to such Reporting Entity and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the financial information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

(7) In the event any member of the Group makes an acquisition of any person after the Issue Date (each such person,
together with its Subsidiaries, being an "Acquired Entity"), for accounting periods any part of which fall on or
prior to the date 12 months from the date of completion of such acquisition:

(i) to the extent financial statements are required to be delivered in relation to any such accounting period,
separate financial statements may be delivered in respect of the Acquired Entity for that period (as
applicable) (and in the event separate accounts or statements are delivered pursuant to this paragraph (i),
any requirement in paragraph (1) above referring to financial statements of, or the consolidated financial
position of, the Group (or similar language) shall be construed as to be a reference to the Group excluding
the Acquired Entity);

(ii) any financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraph (i) may be in a form as customarily prepared by
the Acquired Entity prior to the date of completion of such acquisition (and financial statements delivered
in such form shall satisfy the provisions of paragraph (1) above); and

(iii) for the purpose of calculating any financial ratio under the Indenture any financial statements delivered
pursuant to paragraph (i) may be aggregated with any quarterly or annual financial statements for the
relevant period, as applicable (and appropriate adjustments made for any intra-group transactions).

(8) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event that any period specified in the Indenture
for the Group to deliver any financial statements, certificates, notices, documents or other information expires on
a day which is not a Business Day, that period shall be extended so as to expire on the next Business Day.

(9) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only as
regards the Trustee and the Trustee's receipt of such reports, information and documents shall not constitute
constructive notice or actual knowledge of any information contained therein, including the Issuer's compliance
with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer's
Certificate).

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

_Issuer_

(1) The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge,
consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease
or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by the Issuer's Board of Directors or
shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which the Issuer would dispose of, all or
substantially all of the Issuer's and the Restricted Subsidiaries' properties and assets, taken as a whole, to any other
Person. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving effect to any such
transaction or series of transactions:


-----

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed
by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or to which such
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been made (the "Surviving
**Entity"):**

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member state
of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, the United States of America,
any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland; and

(y) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, an accession agreement or one or more
other documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the
Security Agent (as applicable), the Issuer's obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,
as applicable;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (and
treating any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with or as a result of
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (on the
assumption that the transaction or series of transactions occurred on the first day of the Applicable
Testing Period immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with
the appropriate adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such
_pro forma calculation), (i) the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor_
under the Indenture) could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in
paragraph (1) of the "Limitation on Debt" covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not
be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required
in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, has been duly authorized, executed by
the Issuer or the Surviving Entity (as applicable), complies with the requirements of the Indenture, all
conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been satisfied and the Indenture
and Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, enforceable
in accordance with their terms (subject to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and
qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer
under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, as applicable; provided, however, that in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the
Issuer's assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest, on the Notes.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary, (ii) a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) any transaction or arrangement pursuant to an IPO Pushdown or
(iv) the Issuer from consolidating or otherwise combining with or merging into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another
jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Issuer, _provided the requirements of clauses (a)(x) and (d) of_
paragraph (1) above are satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules and regulations
of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any merger of the Issuer to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices
to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.


-----

_Guarantors_

(1) Subject to the provisions described under "—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees," no Guarantor will, directly
or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate, amalgamate or
otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or
take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by such Guarantor's Board of Directors or shareholders with
respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which such Guarantor will dispose of, all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any other Person. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately
after giving effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either such Guarantor is the surviving corporation; or

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made (such
Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the "Successor Guarantor"), by a
supplemental indenture, an accession agreement or one or more other documents or instruments, each in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable), expressly assumes
the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles and provided that,
immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing and
_provided, further that, the prohibition in clause (1) above shall not apply to the extent that compliance with paragraphs (a)_
and (b) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or
the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary
(or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expense.

(2) The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) any Guarantor from consolidating or otherwise combining with or merging into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such Guarantor, reincorporating the
Guarantor in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Guarantors, _provided the requirements of_
clause (b) of paragraph (1) above are satisfied.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a
Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall procure that no Restricted Subsidiary or Holdco will, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action, which action or omission would or is reasonably likely to, in each case, in the good
faith determination of the Issuer, have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral
(it being understood that the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or of Debt or other obligations secured by the
Collateral shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall procure that no Restricted
Subsidiary or Holdco will, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes (other than of
any Additional Notes), the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral (other than pursuant to a sale, lease,


-----

transfer, disposition, merger or conveyance not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture), provided that (a) nothing in this
provision will restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization, and (b) the incurrence of Debt or Liens not prohibited by the "Limitation on Debt" and/or "Limitation on
_Liens" covenants, as applicable and the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or of Debt or other obligations secured by_
the Collateral (to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture) shall be permitted.

The Indenture will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Notes,
the Security Agent (and/or any other party to each Security Document) shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments, extensions, renewals, restatements, supplements, modifications or replacements to the Security Documents
to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens to the extent
not prohibited under the Indenture (including by way of release and retaking of Security Documents), (iii) comply with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) add to the Collateral, (v) evidence the
succession of another Person to the Issuer, a Guarantor, Holdco or any security provider, as applicable, and the assumption
by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, in each case, in accordance
with the caption "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets," (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting
Collateral from the Liens created under the Security Documents and/or the release of a Guarantor from its Guarantee of
the Notes, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture, (vii) conform the Security
Documents to this "Description of the Notes," (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a
successor Security Agent, (ix) provide for Additional Notes or other Permitted Debt not prohibited by the Indenture that
may be secured by Liens on the Collateral to also benefit from the Collateral, or (x) make any other change thereto that
does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);
_provided, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise_
modified or replaced (otherwise than for reasons specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) (in connection with any enforcement
action) or (iv) through (x)), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or renewal, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, one of:

(a) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent,
from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on a consolidated basis, in each case, after giving effect to any transaction
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement;

(b) a certificate from the Board of Directors or responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer
(acting in good faith) substantially in the form attached to the Indenture that confirms the solvency of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on a consolidated basis, in each case, after giving
effect to any transaction related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement; or

(c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security
Agent (subject to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications), confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement, the security interest or security interests created under the
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are
valid security interests not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law that such security interest or security interests were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that this covenant is complied with, the Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to and instruct the Security Agent to enter into all necessary documentation to implement such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, in connection with
the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Debt not prohibited by the covenant described under the
caption "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt" or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, Holdco,
the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of
such Debt (or their duly authorized representatives) an amended and/or restated Intercreditor Agreement or an additional
intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") containing substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms more favorable to the Holders) including with respect to the subordination, payment
blockage, limitation on enforcement and release of guarantees (or such other terms or with such changes as are necessary


-----

to facilitate compliance with the covenant described under the caption "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
_of Debt") and priority and release of the Security Documents (or such other terms or with such changes as the Issuer may_
in good faith determine to be necessary or appropriate relating to the Security Documents, in connection with the Incurrence
of such Debt, provided that such other terms are not materially more adverse to the Holders taken as a whole than the terms
contained in the Intercreditor Agreement); provided, that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of
the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Trustee
and the Security Agent. If more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective terms
of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict in any material respect.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure
any ambiguity, manifest error, omission, defect or inconsistency of any Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document, (2) increase the amount of Debt of the types covered by any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including
the addition of provisions relating to new Debt that is ranking junior to the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be, as
applicable), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to any Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) add security to or for the benefit of the Notes (including Additional Notes), or confirm and evidence the release,
termination or discharge of any Notes, its Guarantee, or any Lien (including Liens on the Collateral and the Security
Documents) when such release, termination or discharge is provided for or not prohibited under the Indenture, any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (5) make provision for charges of the Collateral
securing Additional Notes to rank pari passu with the Liens under the Security Documents or to implement any Permitted
Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Issuer under
any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (7) make any change in the subordination
provisions of any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that would limit or terminate the
benefits available to any holder of Senior Debt of a Guarantor (or any representative thereof) under such subordination
provisions or as otherwise permitted by any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (8) conform
the text of any Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to any provision of
this "Description of the Notes," (9) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or IPO Pushdown or (10) make any other change
to any Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement or Security Document that does not materially
adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole). The Issuer shall not otherwise request the Trustee and the Security Agent
to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below
under "—Amendments and Waivers," and the Issuer may only request the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee and the Security Agent
or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee and the Security Agent under the Indenture or
any Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, no consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby will be required; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under the caption "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments."_

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of each Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have irrevocably appointed and
authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such
time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) "—Limitation on Restricted Payments;"

(2) "—Limitation on Debt;"


-----

(3) "—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;"

(4) "—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;"

(5) "—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt;"

(6) clause (1)(c) of "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" in respect of the Issuer;

(7) "—Limitation on Asset Sales;" and

(8) "—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,"

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Issuer nor any Restricted
Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described under the
caption "—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries," unless such designation would have complied with
the covenant described under the caption "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" as if such covenant would have been in
effect during such period.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions
of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action
taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments"
covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the
Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under "—Limitation on Debt." In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default
or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an
Investment Grade Status. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied,
_provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to_
be effective. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any duty to
notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability or permission under any basket, test, threshold or ratio under the Indenture, in
each case in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction,
joint venture, Investment, Incurrence, payment or any other transaction (the "Applicable Transaction") where there is a
time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Debt, Liens,
Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments, Permitted Investments, Affiliate Transactions, Asset Sales or any designation
of a Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default
or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (A) the date the definitive agreements for such Applicable
Transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
Applicable Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes
of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction, (B) the date of consummation of any Applicable Transaction
or (C) any other date relevant to the Applicable Transaction determined by the Issuer in good faith, in which case such
baskets, test, threshold or ratios shall likewise be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Applicable
Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the
use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining
the ability to consummate any such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
determined to be in compliance under (A) or (C) above and are exceeded or otherwise not satisfied as a result of fluctuations
in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or _pro forma Consolidated EBITDA)_
subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Applicable Transaction, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or otherwise not satisfied as a result of such fluctuations solely
for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) if the Issuer elects to have such
determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement or on another date as contemplated by (C) above,


-----

any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof and the fixing of any exchange
rates) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered or such other date as contemplated
by (C) above, and in each case to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Indenture (except to the extent such Applicable Transaction is subsequently abandoned). Any determination as to
compliance with a particular basket, ratio, threshold, test or permission by the Issuer in good faith shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive.

Unless otherwise specified in the Indenture, in the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more
than one of the baskets or exceptions set out in a particular provision of the Indenture (subject to the limitations imposed
under paragraph (3) of the "Limitation on Debt" covenant), the Issuer may classify (and may from time to time reclassify)
that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception in respect of the same provision and will only be required to
include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount or
transaction may at the option of the Issuer be split between different baskets or exceptions).

Subject to the limitations imposed under paragraph (3) of the "Limitation on Debt" covenant, if a proposed action,
matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is Incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later
time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action,
matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

In the case of any Debt and/or Lien Incurred to refinance any Debt and/or Lien initially Incurred in reliance on
the "Limitation on Debt" and/or "Limitation on Liens" covenants and measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded (and any related refinancing Debt and/
or Lien shall be deemed permitted) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal
amount of such Debt being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and any fees and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, underwriting discounts,
indemnity fees, discounts, penalties, interest or hedging break costs, and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial,
registration or similar fees and other costs and expenses in connection with such refinancing.

In the event any fixed permissions are intended to be utilized together with any ratio-based permissions in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, (i) compliance with or satisfaction of any ratio-based permission for the portion
of such indebtedness or other applicable transaction or action to be incurred under such ratio-based permission shall first
be calculated without giving effect to amounts being utilized pursuant to any fixed permission but giving full pro forma
effect to all applicable and related transactions (including, subject to the foregoing with respect to fixed baskets, any
incurrence and repayments of indebtedness) and all other permitted pro forma adjustments, and (ii) thereafter, incurrence
of the portion of such indebtedness or other applicable transaction or action to be incurred under any fixed permissions
shall be calculated.

Any Incurrence or drawing of any Debt to finance the working capital needs of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is
available to be re-drawn (including under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility) and for the avoidance of doubt, any
undrawn commitments for Debt (including under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility) shall, unless otherwise elected by
the Issuer, be disregarded for the purposes of testing any financial ratio or incurrence based permission, test, basket or
component thereof.

When calculating the availability or permission under any basket under the Indenture determined by reference to
the greater of a fixed amount (the "numerical permission") and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the "grower
**permission") and the grower permission exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an**
acquisition or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased
to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or
Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

For the avoidance of doubt, references to any transaction being in the "ordinary course of business" of the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry practice
in the industries in which the Group operates (or if the transaction is not specific to the Group's industry, industry generally)
or consistent with past practice of the Group, in each case, as reasonably determined by the Issuer in good faith.

For the purposes of calculating the availability or permission under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, the
exchange rate (including for the purposes of determining any interest) used in any financial definition or components
thereof shall be, at the option of the Issuer, (i) the prevailing rate of exchange as determined by the Issuer (acting
reasonably); (ii) the weighted average exchange rate for the applicable measurement period used by the Issuer to calculate
Consolidated EBITDA (as determined by the Issuer); (iii) any applicable conversion rate used in any relevant financial


-----

statements or management accounts; (iv) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in
good faith) as of the relevant date of determination; or (v) any applicable conversion rate under any Currency Agreement
or other currency hedging arrangement entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and, in each case,
no Default, Event of Default or breach of any undertaking or covenant shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change
in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

Any determination to be made in good faith by the Issuer under the Indenture may be exercised or made by the
Board of Directors, the CEO, the CFO or another Officer of the Issuer or the Group.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an "Event of Default" under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon
acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
contained in the Indenture (other than specified in clauses (a) or (b)) and such failure continues for a
period of 60 days after notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(d) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt for borrowed money (other than
any such Debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary,
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, if that default:

(i) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt; or

(ii) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the
expiration of any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required
prepayment) and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of such
Debt has not been extended (a "Payment Default"),

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Debt, together with the principal amount of any other
such Debt under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, is in excess of €75.0 million;

(e) any Guarantee by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in
writing by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor
that is a Significant Subsidiary, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its
terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture or any Guarantee), if such Default continues for
10 days;

(f) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by insurance) shall
have been rendered against the Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary, or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary for the payment of money either individually or in an aggregate amount, in each
case in excess of €75.0 million (after deducting any insurance or indemnity or contribution amounts
actually recovered by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days of such judgment, order or
decree), and either a creditor shall have commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such judgment,
order or decree or there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of
enforcement of such judgment, order or decree was not (by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in
effect;

(g) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, schemes of arrangement (where
any creditors are materially impaired) or reorganization with respect to the Issuer, Holdco, any
Significant Subsidiary, or of other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would,
in the aggregate, when taken together (as of the end of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements) constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person; and


-----

(h) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable) with respect to Collateral having
a Fair Market Value in excess of €75.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents, as applicable, or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer, Holdco or any Guarantor shall assert
in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for
10 days.

However, a Default under clauses (c), (d), (e), (f) or (h) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the
Issuer of the Default and, the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified above, as applicable, after receipt
of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (g) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Issuer
(and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written request of such Holders,
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the
outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the
Notes will become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (g) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if
any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) under
"—Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (d) shall be remedied
or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged
in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration
of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events
of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the
acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of
the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults or Events of Default under the Indenture (except with respect to
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which case, the consent
of the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind and annul any such acceleration with
respect to such Notes and its consequences (or provide an instruction not to accelerate) if such rescission would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any
remedy thereunder unless the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made a
written request and offered an indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its
sole discretion to institute such proceedings as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute
such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such written notice and receipt of indemnity and/or security (including by
way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee (in its sole discretion) and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not
received directions inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement
of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the
respective due dates expressed in such Note.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer
of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will deliver to each Holder of the Notes
notice of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of an Event of Default in
the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the
giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if it determines in good faith that withholding the giving of such notice
is in the best interests of the Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report


-----

or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled "—
_Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders" or otherwise to deliver any notice, certificate or information pursuant to any other_
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant
breach of any such report required by such covenant or notice, certificate or information, as applicable, even though such
delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice to a responsible officer of the Trustee
that the Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by
it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any continuing Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous
year.

The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders provide to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which might be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity of the
Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes
("Legal Defeasance"). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt
represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if
any, Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred
to below;

(b) the Issuer's obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the
Notes and segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, indemnities and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default other than an Event of Default under clauses (a) or (b) of the definition thereof.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter
any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In
the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under "—Events of Default" will no longer constitute
an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events will not include events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it
has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee, or such other entity
as may be designated by the Trustee for this purpose, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in
euros, European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient,
in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and
discharge the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding Notes
on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must:

(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; and

(ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the outstanding
Notes;


-----

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that (and based thereon such
opinion shall confirm that) the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or other creditors,
or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing debts of the Issuer to the
detriment of the relevant creditors; and

(e) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee or such other entity to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of any acceleration
occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration
of transfer or exchange of the Notes and surviving rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity as
may be designated by the Trustee for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euros
or European Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that
have not, prior to such time, been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if
any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of such deposit
(in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be, and the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case
may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been deposited
by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer as provided for in the Indenture) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation: (x) have become due and
payable (by reason of the sending, or delivery to Euroclear and Clearstream in the case of a
Global Note, of a notice of redemption or otherwise); (y) will become due and payable within
one year of Stated Maturity; or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year of the
proposed discharge date under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption provided to it by the Issuer by the Paying Agent in the Issuer's name
and at the Issuer's expense;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture; provided
that if requested by the Issuer in writing to the Holders, the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request
may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to an Officer's Certificate) no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to such distribution, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall distribute to
the Holders any amounts deposited prior to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided,
_further, that in such case, the payment to each Holder will equal the amount such Holder would have_

avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or relevant redemption

other premium on such amounts. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Person for
the early distribution of funds to Holders as described in this paragraph. To the extent that the Notes are

beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then
applicable procedures of the clearing system;

payment of the Notes at maturity, on the redemption date or such earlier date as instructed by the Issuer
in accordance with clause (b) above, as the case may be; and

to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to
enforceability), each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without
independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact) (including
as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)).

_Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;"_

(b) add to the Issuer's covenants or those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes for

the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the

Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents (as determined by the Issuer in good faith in respect
of Holders);

amendment to the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Guarantees or the Security Documents. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender
of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other than euro
(whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to such Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to


-----

the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase euro on that date, on the first date on
which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that could be recovered following such a purchase is less than the euro
amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally
indemnify the recipient against the cost of the recipient's making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such
difference. For the purposes of this paragraph, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated herein for the Trustee
and/or Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of euro been made with the amount so
received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date had not been possible,
on the first date on which it would have been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Notices**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules and regulations
of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to
the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are physically mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed; and
_provided, further, that any notice delivered via e-mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to have been given on the_
date such notice was "sent" in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Any notice or communication mailed to a
Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to send a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it
shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is sent in the manner provided
above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or
Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any Permitted Holder,
as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note will
waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release will be part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**The Trustee and the Security Agent**

will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written notice from the Issuer is given to
a responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which written
notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture,
the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that
a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking
any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, certain taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to
its satisfaction (as determined in its sole discretion).

Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. will act as Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents on behalf of the secured creditors, including the Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent, acting in its
capacity as such, shall have such duties with respect to the Collateral as are set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Under certain circumstances, the Security Agent may
have obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents
that are in conflict with the interests of the Holders. The Security Agent will be under no obligation to exercise any rights
or powers conferred under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of the Security Documents for the benefit of the secured
creditors (other than the Trustee) unless such secured creditors (other than the Trustee) have provided to the Security Agent
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Security Agent against any loss, liability or expense. Furthermore, each Holder,
by accepting the Notes will agree, for the benefit of the Security Agent, that it is solely responsible for its own independent
appraisal of, and investigation into, all risks arising under or in connection with the Security Documents and has not relied
on or will not at any time rely on the Security Agent or the Trustee in respect of such risks.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement is and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by

rate for the entire Applicable Testing Period or (y) using the average rate in effect over the Applicable Testing Period, (in

term of such Interest Rate Agreement).

on the first day of the relevant period), net of the amount of any actual benefits realized during the relevant period from

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES**
**AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests_
_over the Collateral in each of the jurisdictions in which Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary only,_
_and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor or security provider. The application of these various laws in multiple_
_jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to_
_enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests over the_
_Collateral._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium,_
_England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer and the_
_Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions_
_insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member states of the
European Union (each, a "Member State"). Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26,
2017) (as amended, the "Recast Insolvency Regulation"), applicable within the European Union, other than Denmark,
the courts of the Member State in which a company's "centre of main interests" ("COMI") is situated have jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings.

Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company's COMI "shall be the place where the
debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties" and that in
the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence
of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to
COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company's central administration is located in a Member State other than the
one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company's actual center of management and supervision and the center
of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take
into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where
the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor's
creditors are established.

This means that a company's COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination
of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as of the date the company enters an insolvency
proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or
immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time,
belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of
proceedings. Rights in rem include:

      - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or
income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

      - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

      - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them
contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

      - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency
proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor's COMI
is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of


-----

that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other
Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken
there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets).
They may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties' right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers' rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of
the Recast Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State.

If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of
the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an "establishment" in the territory of such other Member
State, and such insolvency proceedings must be "secondary." Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding
listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up
proceedings.

An "establishment" is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean "any place of
operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets." Accordingly, the opening of secondary
insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an
establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency
proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the
assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another
Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where: either (i) main insolvency proceedings
cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor's COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by
that Member State's law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim
arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State
where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member
State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency
proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary
insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that
has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a
unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings
could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply
with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency
proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval
by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State.
If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency
proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such
proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court,
at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening
of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place
to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner
in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to
the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the
court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings
and of individual classes of creditors.

In addition, the concept of "group coordination proceedings" has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under


-----

Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in
insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the
relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency
practitioner's recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that any of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome
of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the
Issuer or the Guarantors.

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. ("exit day") and therefore
is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides
that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day
(subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly into U.K. domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may
continue to form a part of U.K. domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject
to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146), as amended,
effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the United Kingdom, including the
Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency
Act 1986 (the "Insolvency Act"), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the "Insolvency Rules")
and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the "U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations").
On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation
Agreement. This agreement entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, and applies permanently from May 1,
2021. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and
the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of
personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the
Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in
the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a
replacement for the current automatic recognition of U.K. insolvency procedures across the EU and _vice versa. In the_
absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for U.K. insolvency office holders and U.K.
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located
in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state
and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the
appointment of a U.K. office holder has been made in reliance on a U.K. domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it
is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of
procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive
on restructuring and insolvency) (the "EU Restructuring Directive") was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that
are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to
continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge
of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a
culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears
likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring
Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against
debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate
classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims
shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a
majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a
majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring
plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do
not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed
by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors' rights and


-----

compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into
national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or
interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July
17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time
period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a
maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in
implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that any one of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome
of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer or
Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are
organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the
insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency_**

Subject to the limitations described under "—European Union," where a company incorporated in the Netherlands
(or elsewhere) has its COMI or an "establishment" in the Netherlands, it may be subjected to Dutch insolvency proceedings.
This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats (statutaire zetels)
in the Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their COMI in the
Netherlands. Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions,
and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a
liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction.

The following is an outline of certain aspects of Dutch law and practice relating to insolvency laws. This is not a
complete summary of currently applicable Dutch law or practice, and should not be treated as a substitute for professional
advice. Prospective holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to any matter described in this offering memorandum should
consult their own professional advisors.

**_General_**

There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a)
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor's debts and
enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, (b) statutory composition proceedings, which is also intended to facilitate
the reorganization of a debtor's debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy
(faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor's assets to its creditors. In practice a
suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below.

**_Suspension of Payments_**

An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately
(dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting
of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed
before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension
of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (i.e. more
than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors' meeting or more than one-third of
the number of creditors represented at such creditors' meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors declare against
it. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try
to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy
its creditors in the (near) future.

A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted
the provisional suspension of payments.


-----

The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch
law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets
of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery
under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor.
However, at the request of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a "cooling down period"
(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of
two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.

Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition
will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of
creditors represented at the creditors' meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged
and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest
accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a
court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor's
assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or
canceled by operation of law.

**_Statutory Composition Proceedings – Dutch Scheme_**

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie
_onderhands akkoord) (the "WHOA") on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside_
of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11
procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of
payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as
shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations
through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts
and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being
compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts.
A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or
are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the
Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the
total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class,
participating in the vote, vote in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a
dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one
class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy
of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation
of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor
receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or
(ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from
the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so.
There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails
a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a
different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible
extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the
possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an
undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors, unless otherwise approved by the
court. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments
on the debtor's assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at
least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be


-----

due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of
payments. The debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself; provided it has obtained prior approval
of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the
necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can
request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang).

There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company
realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate
measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a
suspension of payments (see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order
takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed
to the debtor's creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch
insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right
to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective
claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights
that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note's
potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

All unsecured pre-bankruptcy claims have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the
receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what
extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been
payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the
date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted
_pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in_
a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors' meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver
(curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors
whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors' meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount
of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause
payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims
and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement
against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their
claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected
remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset
or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of
the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim
in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a "cooling down period" for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for
another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have
obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor
to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to
Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the
relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may
be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against
an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed
by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations
of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party's obligations, enters into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an
insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below "—
_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer."_

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments
against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor's assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain
other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the
bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate
may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured


-----

and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is
automatically stayed.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to
creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number
of the creditors represented at the creditors' meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are
acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after
satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors,
who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch
insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for
the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the "Parallel Debt") mirroring the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a
pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The
parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk
of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is
commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document.
In addition, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Under Dutch law, the validity and enforceability of the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests over the
Collateral may, in whole or in part, also be affected or limited to the extent that the obligations of the Issuer or the
Guarantors which are incorporated under Dutch law (the "Dutch Guarantors") are not within the scope of their respective
objects and the relevant counterparty was aware or ought to have been aware (without inquiry) of this fact. The articles of
association (statuten) of the Issuer and each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantees and security. However,
the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is
within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company,
but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such
company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any,
derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company,
the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of
the relevant company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) or its administrator (bewindvoerder)
in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling). As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would
conclude that the issuance of a Note, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the
Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that the Issuer or a
Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or
unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to
the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document
was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake
(dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands,
pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may,
regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness
(redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding
factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or a Dutch
Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) (the "Enterprise Chamber") on the mention of a holder or
holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value
of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company's articles of association. If the company has an
issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares


-----

in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor
with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company's articles of association. A trade
union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch
company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the
guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or
avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand
that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide
sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is
subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot
be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977
Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the
enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and
collection costs.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests created
pursuant to the relevant security documents.

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other
liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor's assets. However, Dutch law
provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities' priority right ranks above a
non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes
often used to interfere with these tax authorities' priority, most notably the lease of the debtor's premises
(bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme,
now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after
the moment the tax authorities have been informed.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure
on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law,
security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil
Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited
liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance
with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company's articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure.
Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge
has been disclosed to the debtor.

The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent
court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant
security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security
Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined
by the court.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions, known as "actio pauliana," dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside of bankruptcy. The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees
the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party's
obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect)
can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver in a
bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person
performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the
case of the person's bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii)
at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the
counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest


-----

may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in
such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have
known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no
consideration.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy.

In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis
of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted
at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii)
if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such
guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor's other creditors. If a Dutch
court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the
Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the Notes, any guarantees or security interests
granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. In addition,
under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of
the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be
created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to which a
Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that
company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in
respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited liability
company which should be registered in its shareholders' register. However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of
the absence of any pre-existing security.

**Austria**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law. The law relating to insolvency
is regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) (the "IO") which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The
IO regulates on the one hand bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtor's assets or company as a whole are sold and the
proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also provides for recovery proceedings - insolvency
enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions.
Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act
(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates the reorganization of
companies in financial distress – see further below for details.

As to Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Austria (the "Austrian Guarantors"), a rebuttable presumption
exists that these entities also have their respective COMI in Austria.

Insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria in the event of an insolvency of a company having its COMI
in Austria, or if such company has an "establishment" in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the Recast
Insolvency Regulation does not apply, also if such company has assets in Austria. Such proceedings will be governed by
Austrian law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Austria in accordance with
Austrian law with respect to the assets of companies that are not organized under Austrian law.

Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that the
insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. A debtor is insolvent in case
of illiquidity within the meaning of section 66 IO (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and
when they fall due) or over-indebtedness within the meaning of section 67 IO (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor's liabilities
exceed the liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as a going
concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)). Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the
debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings
are initiated upon a creditor's request, such creditor will have to show that the debtor is illiquid or over-indebted. In the
event that the debtor is at imminent risk of becoming illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), insolvency proceedings may
be initiated only upon the debtor's request.


-----

The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon insolvency. If
it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency immediately. If the debtor
undertakes promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency, the debtor has a maximum period of 60 days
to file. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IO has been amended to allow the debtor 120 days to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor's illiquidity is caused by a natural disaster, which includes pandemics,
epidemics, floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or similar disasters of comparable
magnitude.

Depending on whether the debtor submits a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the application for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated proceedings may be in the form of recovery proceedings
(Sanierungsverfahren) or bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren). If it is the debtor that has applied for the initiation
of insolvency proceedings as recovery proceedings and has submitted to the court a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that
offers a recovery rate of at least 20% payable to the unsecured creditors within a maximum period of two years, the court
initiates insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings. If the conditions for recovery proceedings are not
met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. The legal provisions regulating recovery proceedings do not
apply to bankruptcy proceedings.

A debtor may also submit a recovery plan during bankruptcy proceedings that are already in progress. For the
debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court it should meet certain criteria specified by sections 140 et seq IO.

The purpose of a recovery plan is to enable a debtor to be released from a portion of its debts (not to exceed 80%
of the aggregate amount thereof) and to continue its business operations. A recovery plan must be approved by a "qualified
majority" of the debtor's unsecured creditors for it to become effective. For the approval of the recovery plan, two majorities
must be reached: (i) more than half of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote must approve of the recovery
plan and (ii) the creditors voting in favor of the recovery plan must represent more than 50% of the aggregate amount of
all claims of the unsecured creditors present at such hearing. Once the debtor has complied with the terms of a recovery
plan that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, it will be released from its remaining outstanding
unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in accordance with the
plan's terms may enforce their individual claims against the debtor. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the
creditors, insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.

If the recovery proceedings have been initiated and the debtor has submitted a recovery plan that offers a recovery
rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors over a maximum two-year period after the approval of such recovery plan,
the debtor qualifies for self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren mit Eigenverwaltung).

Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor is not allowed as of the date of the opening of the
insolvency proceedings to dispose of the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). The opening of
insolvency proceedings takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such proceedings in
[the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the opening of insolvency proceedings](http://www.edikte.justiz.gv.at/)
(and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the
insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of the insolvency estate.

With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either ex officio or upon the
request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors' committee (Gläubigerausschuss) charged
with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency
proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on
behalf of the insolvency estate.

Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator's role is to continue the debtor's business with a view to enabling
a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by implementing the debtor's recovery plan or by a (partial) sale
of the debtor's business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor's business is possible, the insolvency
administrator will discontinue the debtor's business operations. As a result of the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the
debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized thereby will be distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the
debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such proceeds.

If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery
administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either
subject to the recovery administrator's approval or may be performed only by the recovery administrator.

Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor need to participate in
the insolvency proceedings and must file their claim with the competent court within the period set out in the court order
opening the insolvency proceedings. At the respective hearing (examination hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung)), the insolvency
administrator must declare whether it acknowledges or contests each of the claims filed with the court. If the insolvency
administrator acknowledges a creditor's claim, such creditor will be entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings


-----

and the pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors that will follow. If a creditor's claim is contested by the insolvency
administrator, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil proceedings and only then participate in the
insolvency proceedings.

Claims of unsecured creditors which were created before the opening of the insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzforderungen) rank pari passu among themselves. Certain claims which lawfully arose against the insolvency
estate after the opening of the insolvency proceedings (privileged claims (Masseforderungen)) enjoy priority in insolvency
proceedings. Claims which are secured by in rem security, such as pledge over shares (preferential claims
(Absonderungsrechte)), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the realization
of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution to the
unsecured creditors to the extent that the proceeds from the realization of the assets charged to them did not cover their
claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect
to the approval of the recovery plan to the extent their claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes,
social security contributions and employee compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian
law.

The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during such proceedings constitute
privileged claims (Masseforderungen) and rank prior to all other unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen). Claims of
creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a retention of title or
trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. According to the IO, a request for
preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation of the debtor's
business cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, unless, inter alia, the
preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring
severe personal or economic damages.

Once insolvency proceedings have been opened it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with respect to
assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject to an automatic stay
(Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings
expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings
are terminated due to lack of funds to cover the cost of such proceedings. Execution liens obtained within the last twelve
months may be subject to voidance law.

According to the IO (and subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions), for a
period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may terminate
contracts only for good cause. In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely performance
by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered a good cause allowing a termination. This
restriction only applies if a termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the debtor's business. No
restrictions apply if a termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe
personal or economic damages. Furthermore, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an
agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency proceedings against the other party is not
enforceable (again, subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

**_Reorganization proceedings_**

The Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) (the "URG") governs
reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to continue to do business after
having undergone a reorganization procedure. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is therefore not designed to assist
creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor's enterprise. A reorganization
procedure may be opened if a substantial and sustainable deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may
be certifiably anticipated. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however,
that it is not insolvent at the time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings
may result in personal liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. The relevant criteria for the opening of a
business reorganization procedure are a quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt
repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years applies, each as defined in, and determined in accordance
with, the URG. Pursuant to section 19 of the URG, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an
agreement, for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the opening of
reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is (subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial
transactions) not enforceable.


-----

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

The Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung, "ReO") is based on the Restructuring Directive for
the right of an entrepreneur (except for certain companies in the financial sector, such as credit institutions and public
bodies) to voluntarily file for the opening of restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) where there is a
likelihood of insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz), in particular where the relevant company is imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig). The likelihood of insolvency is presumed where the criteria for the opening of a business
reorganization procedure under the URG (see above) are met. Creditors cannot file for the opening of restructuring
proceedings.

The primary objective of the ReO is the approval of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) by the majority
of the creditors of the debtor in each class (see below). Such restructuring plan which shall ensure the solvency of the
debtor needs to be submitted by the debtor. Under certain circumstances, the court may confirm the restructuring plan
(Restrukturierungsplan), even if the qualified majority is not reached in each class (cross-class cram-down). This cramdown possibility is aimed at finally removing the disruptive potential of hold-out creditors outside of insolvency
proceedings.

Amongst others, the exercise of rights as well as their enforcement, may be limited under the ReO. For example,
and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) claims
may be restructured (for example by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a reduction in the value of the relevant claims
(Forderungskürzung)), subject to certain preconditions to be met, even without the consent of or against the affected
creditors, (ii) the ReO allows for a stay of individual enforcement actions (Vollstreckungssperre) during restructuring
proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) for a period of three up to a maximum of six months and (iii) during restructuring
proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) it is not allowed, subject to certain prerequisites to be met and exemptions (e.g.
for derivatives and other financial transactions), to withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or, in any other way,
modify essential contracts yet to be performed (wesentliche noch zu erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant
debtor by virtue of a contractual clause providing for such measures, solely by reason of, for instance, the opening of
restructuring proceedings or meeting the pre-requisites for the opening of restructuring proceedings.

The ReO provides for five different possible creditor classes in restructuring proceedings: (i) secured creditors,
(ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders, (iv) particularly vulnerable creditors (with claims below Euro 10,000) and (v)
subordinated creditors.

Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures. However,
shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), with the consequence that there is no
possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cram-down. Therefore, a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan)
cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not
enforceable against the will of the shareholders.

New or interim financing as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those
necessary for the continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible subsequent
insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing party did not know
about the debtor's illiquidity.

The ReO also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure that can be used by the debtor if only
financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures. In such simplified proceedings, the debtor
remains entirely in possession (no restructuring expert will be appointed). Further, creditors do not need to vote on a
restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) in a court hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring
agreement that has already been signed by at least a 75% majority in value of each financial creditor class (no majority
based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such restructuring agreement can be sanctioned by the court without the
initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an enforcement stay in these fasttrack proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible in such proceedings.

Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the ReO, which do not qualify as European restructuring proceedings
(Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly available registers or data bases._

**_Appointment of a curator_**

Pursuant to the Act on Curators regarding Partial Debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungskuratorengesetz), a
curator may be appointed as representative for the holders of partial debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungen) by the
competent court under specific circumstances, in particular, if rights of holders of such partial debentures might be
endangered due to the lack of common representation. This might particularly be the case if insolvency proceedings were
opened (see the explanation of COMI above). Following this, in general and with regard to the scope of the representation
by the curator, the respective holders of such partial debentures may not exert their rights arising out of the partial


-----

debentures on their own, as such rights are then exerted by the curator; however, they are in general entitled to accede the
respective legal proceedings initiated by the curator against the issuer as intervenor (Nebenintervenient).

The powers of the court-appointed trustee to exercise the collective rights of the noteholders would deprive the
holders and the trustee for the Notes of their ability to exercise their rights under the transaction documents, including their
rights to enforce the Guarantees under the Notes.

**_Equity replacing shareholder loans_**

The Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) contains detailed provisions regarding
equity replacing shareholder loans. It in particular stipulates that a loan granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder in a
financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is illiquid, over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure are
met) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity replacing shareholder loans must not be repaid as long as the crisis subsists
and any security interest granted in connection with such loans must not be enforced. This means, in particular, that in an
insolvency of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated (i.e., there is no right for
separation (Aussonderungsrecht) or a right for separate satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A shareholder
is defined to be, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least
25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in the borrower but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden
_Einfluss) regarding the borrower. Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as_
shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which
allows a dominant influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) regarding the borrowing company (indirect controlling
participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the borrowing company of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a
controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the borrowing
company.

Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even stricter
rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to the provisions of the Act
on Equity Replacements, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme Court are still
applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts. In this context, it must also be noted that it is uncertain
whether the rules on equity substituting shareholder loans also apply to "a-typical pledgees" (atypische Pfandgläubiger)
and/or under what circumstances a secured lender may qualify as a-typical pledgee.

**_Limitations on the validity and the enforcement of guarantees by Austrian Guarantors_**

**_Capital Maintenance Rules – General_**

The provision and enforcement of upstream and cross stream guarantees by the Austrian Guarantors is subject to
any may be limited by strict Austrian capital maintenance rules on the preservation of corporate assets
(Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian corporate law, in particular sections 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on
Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (the "Austrian GmbHG") (or
sections 52 and 65 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Joint Stock Companies (Aktiengesetz) (the "Austrian AktG")
respectively). These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantors for the benefit of their respective creditors. The
entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by Austrian capital maintenance
rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships of which the general partner/s is or
are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders in circumstances other than as a distribution of profits (if, to
the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by a reduction of share capital or as liquidation
surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited
liability partner of which is a corporation) in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
are considered disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian
subsidiary were not for the Austrian subsidiary's corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt). Austrian corporate law does
not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt) must be tested at the level of the
individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the group (but not for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be
sufficient. Any transaction that violate Austrian capital maintenance rules are null and void. This nullity may also affect
third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective
transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules.

Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee with respect to liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating Austrian capital maintenance rules and the
resultant invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to
contain so-called "limitation language" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Austria (see _Capital_
_Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language). Pursuant to such limitation language, the grant of collateral and the provision_
of upstream and sidestream guarantees of Austrian subsidiaries are limited to the extent required to avoid a breach of the
Austrian capital maintenance rules.


-----

No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the Indenture
entered into by Austrian Guarantors, in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount permitted
under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired
effect of legally preserving the Guarantees to the extent possible or whether the Guarantees could be deemed void in their
entirety. Moreover, Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot be ruled out
that future court rulings may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of subsidiaries incorporated
in Austria and constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited partnership the general partner or general partners of
which is or are corporations.

**_Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language_**

The limitation language for any Austrian Guarantor to be incorporated into in the Indentures and / or guarantees,
will substantially be in the form as follows:

(a) For purposes of this section "Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language", below terms shall have
the following meanings:

"Austrian **Capital** **Maintenance** **Rules"** refers to Austrian capital maintenance rules
(Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian corporate laws, in particular sections 82 _et seq. of the_
Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) and/or
sections 52 and 65 et seq. of the Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), including, for the avoidance
of doubt, section 66a of the Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) to the extent directly or per
analogiam applicable.

"Maximum Amount" means the maximum amount which the respective Austrian Guarantor is permitted
to pay or secure pursuant to the Finance Documents (i) without violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and
(ii) without exposing the managing directors or members of the supervisory board of the Austrian Guarantor to
any personal liability or criminal responsibility.

"Austrian Guarantor" means a Guarantor that:

(a) is incorporated and registered with the Austrian companies register (Firmenbuch); or

(b) in respect of a company incorporated and registered in a non-EU member state, has its real
seat of its administration in the Republic of Austria; or

(c) any other corporation to which Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules apply.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations (Verpflichtungen) and
liabilities (Haftungen) of an Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement shall at all times be limited so that
at no time shall an Austrian Guarantor be required to assume any liability (Haftung) or obligation
(Verpflichtung) to pay or secure any amount under this Agreement to the extent that such liability
(Haftung) or obligation (Verpflichtung) would violate Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. Should any
obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of the Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement violate
or contradict Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and therefore be held invalid or unenforceable or
should the assumption or enforcement of such obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) expose
any managing director, member of the supervisory board or officer of the respective Austrian Guarantor
to personal (civil) liability or criminal responsibility, such obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability
(Haftung) shall be deemed to be replaced by an obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of a
similar nature (i) which is in compliance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules; (ii) which does not
expose the managing directors, members of the supervisory board, or officer of the Austrian Guarantor
to any personal liability or criminal responsibility; and (iii) which provides the best possible security
interest in favour of the noteholders. By way of example, should it be held that any obligation
(Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) of the Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement contradicts
Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules this obligation (Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) shall be reduced
to the Maximum Amount. Such limitation may have the effect of reducing the amount of the obligations
(Verpflichtungen) and liabilities (Haftungen) to zero.

(c) According to the Parties' current understanding of the Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, the Maximum
Amount shall not be less than the sum of:

(i) the respective Austrian Guarantor's distributable balance sheet profit (Bilanzgewinn) as defined
in section 224 para 3 item A no. IV of the Austrian Enterprise Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch))
as calculated by reference to the most recent (audited, if applicable) financial statements of such


-----

Austrian Guarantor then available and always provided that the shareholders of such Austrian
Guarantor have passed the relevant distribution resolution (Ausschüttungsbeschluss),

(ii) PLUS any other amounts which are freely available or can be converted into amounts freely
available for distribution to such Austrian Guarantor's shareholder(s) under the Austrian Act on
Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) or the
Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), as applicable, and the Austrian Enterprise
Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch) (in particular, unrestricted reserves (freie Rücklagen)) at the
time or times payment under or in connection with this Agreement is requested from such
Austrian Guarantor and always provided that the shareholders of that Austrian Guarantor have
passed the relevant distribution resolution (Ausschüttungsbeschluss),

(iii) PLUS (subject to paragraph (b) above (Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules)) the equivalent of
the aggregate loans or other financial accommodation (plus any accrued interest, commission
and fees thereon) received by the Issuer and made available to such Austrian Guarantor in form
of intercompany financing arrangements (on-lending),

provided that, in each case listed in paragraphs (i) through (iii) above, the re-imbursement claim
(Rückgriffsanspruch) by such Austrian Guarantor against the debtor of the guaranteed and/or secured
claim may be freely set-off with a claim of such debtor against such Austrian Guarantor.

(d) No reduction of the amount enforceable under the guarantee and indemnity in accordance with the
limitations set out in paragraph (b) above (Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules) will prejudice the rights
of each noteholder to continue enforcing the guarantee and indemnity (subject always to the operation of
the limitations set out in this section at the time of such enforcement) until full satisfaction of the
guaranteed claims.

**_Limitations on enforcement – regulatory approvals_**

Enforcement of the pledges over the Shares in the Austrian Guarantors or even the exercise of voting rights by the
Security Agent ahead of such enforcement may be conditional on certain approvals, including approvals under applicable
merger control laws and foreign direct investment laws.

**_Accessory security interests/Parallel debt_**

Certain security interests such as pledges under Austrian law are accessory rights (akzessorisches Rechte) and will
therefore be subject to the same legal consequences as the secured obligations; if the secured obligations are terminated or
not valid, the same applies to the security interest. The security interest cannot be separated from the secured obligations,
which means that it can only be held and enforced by the creditor of such secured obligations. Due to their accessory nature,
pledges will cease by operation of Austrian law upon payment (or other discharge) of the secured obligations.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent
for the purpose of the Security Agent being able to hold the Collateral. Pursuant to such parallel debt obligations, the
Security Agent is an independent and separate creditor, acting on behalf of itself and the secured parties, in respect of each
and every claim under the Notes and the Indenture. While parallel debt obligation are market standard and believed to be
recognized (if effective under their governing law), they are untested before the Austrian courts, and no assurances can be
given that parallel debt will be recognized in accordance with its terms by the Austrian courts.

**_Hardening periods and clawback_**

Under the voidance rules of the IO, an insolvency administrator may, by action of voidance or by defense of
voidance, under certain circumstances, challenge any transaction (which term for the purposes of this section "Hardening
periods and clawback" includes, without limitation, the granting of security and the guaranteeing, assuming and/or paying
of debt). In particular, the following transactions are voidable with respect to the insolvent entity's creditors:

   - Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht): All transactions
performed or entered into by the insolvent entity within ten years prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings with the intent known to the other party to discriminate against its creditors as well as all
transactions through which the insolvent entity's creditors are discriminated against and which it performed
or entered into during the last two years prior to commencement of insolvency proceedings, provided that
the beneficiary of the transaction should have been aware of such intent. If the legal act was concluded with
or for the benefit of certain connected persons (as defined by law) the burden of proof regarding the
knowledge of the intention to discriminate is shifted to that connected person, i.e., the connected person must
prove that they had no knowledge and was not negligent in having no knowledge, respectively. Should the


-----

debtor be a legal entity capable of being a party in a lawsuit, then members of the managing and supervisory
bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited liability and the debtor's controlling
shareholder or "shareholders" within the definitions of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements
(Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) are deemed to be connected.

   - Voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung): Delivery, purchase
and barter transactions undertaken by the insolvent entity in the last year prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings are voidable, if the other party perceived or should have perceived the intent to
discriminate against the insolvent entity's creditors through transactions below market value.

   - Voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung unentgeltlicher oder
_ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen): In particular, transactions of the insolvent entity without consideration_
(except customary occasional gifts and transactions for a reasonable and proportionate amount towards a
charitable cause or for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, a moral duty or consideration of decency) and
acquisitions of property from the insolvent entity by order of authority if paid out of the insolvent entity's
funds are voidable, if performed or entered into in the last two years prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

   - Voidance due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung): Security or payment given to a
creditor after the occurrence of the insolvent entity's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) or after filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or in the last 60 days before
such filing is voidable, if (i) the creditor obtained a security or payment it was not entitled to or not entitled
to in this particular manner or at that particular time, (ii) the security or payment was given to persons who
were aware or should have been aware of the intent of the insolvent entity to treat them preferential ahead
of the debtor's other creditors, or (iii) the transaction was effected for the benefit of a connected person,
unless such connected person (as defined by law, see above) did not know and should not have known about
the debtor's intention to give preferential treatment. A grant of security or payment under such circumstances
is not voidable if the preferential treatment was given more than one year prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

   - Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit): Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the insolvent entity's_
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or after the filing of a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings may be challenged if:

       - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to
a connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other transaction entered into by the
debtor with such connected person which is considered to be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors
(nachteilige Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with respect to such payment or granting of security, or to
a transaction directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor
should have had knowledge of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of
a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly
prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the insolvency estate
was not objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction;

       - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to
a creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a third party which is directly
prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have
known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings; and

       - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors,
provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's inability to
pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
and (ii) such transaction's negative effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at
the time of entering into the transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in
particular, when a recovery effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches
_Sanierungskonzept)._

A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may be objectively
balanced, i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, it nonetheless has a negative effect on the recovery rate of
unsecured creditors.Transactions carried out more than six months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may not
be voided due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der Zahlungsunfähigkeit).


-----

The relevant hardening/suspect periods will commence upon the entry into of the relevant transaction.
Consequently, upon the issuance of the Notes, the relevant hardening/suspect periods in relation to the Guarantees will
commence. Furthermore, the relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization
proceeding if such reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods. See "Business
_reorganisation proceedings."_

In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the IO, a creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any transactions pursuant to the provisions of the
Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action
vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on which such
other creditor exercises its voidance rights in court.

**_Stamp Duty_**

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Gebührengesetz) (the "GebG"), ad valorem stamp duty is triggered upon
the creation of a document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the GebG) on certain
stampable transactions enumerated in the GebG. Stampable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties,
assignments, mortgages.

According to the GebG, stamp duty on, e.g.,

(a) sureties (Bürgschaft) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts to 1% of
the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated as a surety for
stamp duty purposes); and

(b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in a case of an assignment for
security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned
receivables.

Stampable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp
duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical ancillary
charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (section 20(5) of the GebG). Note that
this exemption is not available for, inter alia, security for the Notes.

As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampable transaction is created in Austria
and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty.

Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampable transaction outside of Austria may
trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to the
transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of
effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to
the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria.

If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered
if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian
situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a
legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy
thereof) is made in Austria.

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampable transaction in a qualified
manner (so called confirming document; _rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of_
Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived
from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to
the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third
party to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered by a so-called substitute
document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a stampable transaction or a document
that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampable transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the GebG generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and
severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to
performance (e.g. a surety), the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the
beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the GebG). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is
not duly notified of the stampable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be
secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered
are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within their discretion.


-----

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a stampable
transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to 100%
depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with
slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the GebG have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (each, a "Belgian Guarantor"), and provided
Belgium is the territory in which the center of such Belgian Guarantor's main interests is situated, main insolvency
proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain
circumstances, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency
proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017) (recast) (the "Recast Insolvency
Regulation") and Belgian law also allow territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets (located
in Belgium) of companies that do not have their center of main interests in Belgium. The effects of those territorial
bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the
context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide mainly for two in court insolvency proceedings: judicial
reorganization (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy _(faillissement/faillite). Both_
proceedings are regulated by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de
_droit économique), as amended. Note that Belgian insolvency law offers different out of court restructuring options but_
that these will not be further discussed.

Recently an Act was adopted in the Belgian Parliament to implement the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023
(the "New Insolvency Act"). The New Insolvency Act amends certain provisions of Book XX of the Code of Economic
Law, in particular with respect of restructuring proceedings. These new provisions apply to insolvency proceedings
(including judicial restructuring) opened as of September 1, 2023. Note that the New Insolvency Act distinguishes between
private and public (in court) reorganization proceedings and offers the possibility for companies to silently prepare for
bankruptcy proceedings (the "Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceeding"). These key changes are briefly discussed below.

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to all legal entities as well as all individuals that qualify as an
enterprise (onderneming/entreprise) in the sense of Article I.1, 1° of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, subject to certain
exceptions for regulated liberal professions, credit institutions and certain other entities active on the financial and insurance
markets.

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a
petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. The
contents of this principle are broad and are defined in practice by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are
met (entailing that the debtor has the legal obligation to declare bankruptcy under Book XX of the Belgian Code of
Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for judicial reorganization. The obligation to declare
bankruptcy is suspended as from the filing of a petition for judicial reorganization. If the net assets of the company have
fallen under 50% of the company's registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the
enterprise is always presumed to be at risk.

The petition for judicial reorganization must indicate the measures and proposals that will be taken or made by
the debtor to carry out the reorganization. A number of documents must also be attached to the petition, including, but not
limited to, an interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor, an external expert
accountant or a certified tax accountant. The court may however review and, as the case may be, grant a petition to open
judicial reorganization proceedings where the debtor has been unable to provide certain required documents.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a
ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during
the period between the filing of the petition and the court's decision, subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor's
assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors
may hold with respect to such assets. If the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than
six months before and such request was granted, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect, except if the
court decides otherwise.


-----

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of
the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for reorganization and will hear
the report from the delegated judge. After this hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial
reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and all required documents have been
provided, the court will declare the judicial reorganization proceeding open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a
maximum period of six months (for proceedings opened before September 1, 2023) or four months (for proceedings opened
as of September 1, 2023). At the request of the debtor or the relevant insolvency practitioners and after having obtained a
report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended to a total maximum period of twelve
months as from the initial start of the moratorium period. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and
obtained a judicial reorganization proceeding in the last twelve months before the new request.

The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures with respect to
preexisting claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor's assets from the time that the
moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. Furthermore, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt
or wound up by court order. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims.
Creditors however retain the possibility to create legal or contractual security.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory
character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the
situation of the creditor concerned.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor, these will not be affected by the moratorium provided
that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of
such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the
debtor (such as the debtor's customers) during the moratorium. Receivables that form part of a pledge over business assets
do not benefit from such exemption. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act
of December 15, 2004 (the "Belgian Financial Collateral Act"), such as shares in any Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case
of a pledge on cash held on accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain
other conditions are met.

Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor's creditors are not covered by the enforcement
prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or
qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment
by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the
enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor in principle
continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request
of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the reorganization,
the court may appoint an enterprise mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d'entreprise) to assist the debtor during
the moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of all or part of its assets or its activities. The court may also appoint a
judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon the request of the debtor, any interested party or
the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings (kennelijk grove tekortkomingen/manquements graves
_et caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties_
or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks
indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition,
in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et caractérisée), the court may, upon the
request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopig
_bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor's corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium and_
charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any interested party or upon its own initiative,
the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management of all or part of its assets or activities in case of
important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, _bepaalde_ _en_ _met_ _elkaar_ _overeenstemmende_
_aanwijzigingen/indices graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._

Note that the New Insolvency Act aims at simplifying the existing regime and introducing new insolvency
practitioners, ie the restructuring expert (herstructureringsdeskundige/practicien de la reorganization) and the liquidation
expert (vereffeningsdeskundige/practicien de la liquidation) – both considered judicial administrators.

The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the reorganization, has
additional powers, including the power to advise the court to end the reorganization procedure prematurely if he or she
considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of his or her business.


-----

Reorganization proceedings aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the
initiation of the proceeding does not terminate any contracts. Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination
or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms
such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Subject to certain conditions, such enforcement
prohibition does not apply to close-out netting provisions. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that
a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor's default that occurred prior to the reorganization proceeding
if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during
the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to
be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise
of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable
agreement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of)
the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the
court and/or third parties.

**_Amicable Agreement_**

The debtor may opt for an amicable agreement with at least two creditors (for proceedings opened before
September 1, 2023) or one creditor (for proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023) with a view to restructuring part or
all of its assets and activities. Parties are free to determine the content of the amicable agreement, which cannot bind third
parties. If an agreement is reached, it is filed into the insolvency register and sanctioned by the court. Certain provisions
that allow creditors to challenge transactions that occurred during the hardening period, do not apply to the amicable
agreement, nor to the transactions performed in implementation thereof, upon the condition that: (i) for petitions filed
before September 1, 2023: the amicable agreement was established in writing and that the amicable agreement indicates
and justifies its usefulness for the restructuring of the debtor, and (ii) for petitions filed as of September 1, 2023: the
amicable agreement is sanctioned by court.

**_Collective Agreement_**

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during
the reorganization procedure.

For that purpose, within a period of 8 days following the ruling declaring the judicial restructuring proceedings
open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in
the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims,
as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured
claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a
preliminary basis for the purpose of the restructuring procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of
absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking
of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least
one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan, the amount of
its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the restructuring plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a restructuring plan, with the assistance of
the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures, such as the reduction or rescheduling of
liabilities and interest obligations, and the swap of debt into equity, and may be based on a differentiated treatment for
certain various categories of liabilities.

The plan must be filed with the Clerk's Office of the enterprise court at least 20 days in advance of the date on
which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan. The plan will be approved if a double majority (both
in headcount and in principal amount due) of the creditors vote in favor, it being understood that the court needs to ratify
the restructuring plan prior to it taking effect. The plan will be binding on the debtor and on all creditors (including the
ones who voted against the plan, or abstained).

For judicial restructuring proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023, a new voting system will apply for
restructuring plans which involve large enterprises debtors (ie if during two consecutive financial years, one or more of the
following thresholds have been met: (i) annual average number of employees of 250, (ii) annual turnover excluding VAT
of €40,000,000, or (iii) the balance sheet total reaches €20,000,000 – this also applies if group companies together exceed
one or more of the thresholds). Under the large enterprise regime, creditors (including shareholders) can and to a certain
extend must be placed in different voting classes if their rights in a hypothetical liquidation or the rights obtained under the


-----

restructuring plan are so dissimilar that there is no comparable position (in most cases, there will be a class of privileged
creditors and of non-privileged creditors). In principle, a restructuring plan is adopted if every class has voted in favor of
the restructuring plan, i.e. if a simple majority (in amount of the claim or interest) is obtained. If one or more classes vote
against the plan, the court can only sanction the reorganization plan via a 'cross-class cram down' mechanism. This requires
that additional confirmation criteria are met. SME's may opt-in to this new regime or choose to apply the SME voting
regime, which resembles the current voting regime for collective agreement (see above). These two regimes are therefore
coexisting in Book XX of the Code of Economic Law, the legislators' objective being not to hinder access to reorganisation
procedures for small businesses.

**_Transfer of Activities_**

A court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor's enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at
a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest
in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor's enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.
The price of the transferred assets should at least be equal to the liquidation value/assets to be transferred. In the case of
comparable offers, priority will be given to the offer guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement.

A court-ordered transfer will be organized and implemented by a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice – named liquidation expert as of September 1, 2023) appointed by the court.
Following the transfer, claims of creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to certain exceptions. In the case of
a court-ordered transfer, contracting parties to ongoing agreements can be forced to continue to perform the agreement
without their consent after the transfer (except in case of intuitu personae agreements), provided historical debts under such
agreement are paid.

For judicial restructuring proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023, the court-ordered transfer must be followed
by liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings of the debtor.

**_Private Judicial Restructuring Proceedings_**

The New Insolvency Act distinguishes between private and public restructuring proceedings. As of September 1,
2023, Book XX of the Code of Economic Law will allow debtors to apply for a private judicial reorganization by amicable
or collective agreement. In such case, all proceedings will be confidential with the exception of the debtor or the
practitioner, the court and the specific creditors involved.

Private judicial restructuring proceeding may be initiated by a debtor of a creditor (including shareholders) of the
company. The opening of the proceedings would only impact those parties that will be affected by the plan, which may be
limited to financial creditors for example. The court rules within eight days on the petition for private judicial restructuring.
Opting for the private judicial reorganization implies a court-appointed restructuring expert who assists all parties during
the negotiations. During private judicial restructuring proceedings, the debtor does not automatically benefit from a stay of
enforcement measures, but under certain conditions the restructuring expert may request the court to apply a stay in respect
of certain creditors.

**_Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

As of September 1, 2023, a new insolvency procedure will be introduced, which is regulated in Title V/ III Book
XX of the Code of Economic Law. These (pre-pack) proceedings will allow insolvent companies to discreetly prepare for
the transfer of assets and activities under court supervision before formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened. Pre-Packaged
bankruptcy proceedings can only be initiated by the debtor. In its petition, the debtor must demonstrate that these
proceedings will (i) facilitate the liquidation of the company while achieving the highest possible distribution to the joint
creditors, and (ii) preserve jobs to the extent possible. If the court grants the debtor's request, a liquidation expert is
appointed for maximum 30 days (with possible extension to a total of 60 days). The liquidation expert will take the lead
during the preparation phase and will assess whether the transfer of all or part of the undertaking is likely to be successful,
taking into account the interests of all creditors involved. The preparation phase is done under the supervision of a
prospective supervisory judge. During the preparations, the debtor remains in control of its assets and the day-to-day
operation of its business. The debtor will however actively cooperate in order to achieve the transfer of its assets within the
shortest possible time. Following the confidential preparation procedure, formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened.

**_Bankruptcy_**

The Belgian bankruptcy proceeding is governed by Title VI of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law (which
has replaced the former Bankruptcy Act of August 8, 1997, since May 1, 2018).


-----

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public
Prosecutor's office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor's assets, by the liquidator of the debtor's assets or by the
liquidator of 'main insolvency proceedings' opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with
the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will
establish a date by which all creditors' claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in respect of any "enterprise" as defined by Article I.1, 1° of the Code of
Economic Law (which includes notably any legal person, other than certain public law entities). Conditions for a
bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of
payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt
_is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts_
as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary.

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt
business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the
business and implements the sale of the debtor's assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation
of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the
court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The mere fact that an enterprise has more debts
than assets does not entail the bankruptcy conditions are met with. Companies whose judicial liquidation has been started
can be declared bankrupt up to six months after the judgments of the closing of the liquidation.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing
before the bankruptcy order) or whether they terminate ongoing contracts unilateral if such termination is required for
administrating the bankrupt estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may summon the receiver to take a decision
within 15 days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing
contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day term. If the receiver decides not to continue
performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the
other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, for which claim he has to file a debt claim in the bankruptcy.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of
the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors.

Further, the opening of bankruptcy proceedings will not cause ongoing agreements to terminate. The following
exceptions however apply:

a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
automatic early termination or acceleration event; and

b) _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since
the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to
perform under such contracts.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court
order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the
debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge of financial instruments or cash held
on account, falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act.

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period
until the filing of the first report of claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended
for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be
made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing
the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding,
are located in another EU member state, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the Recast
Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security.


-----

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following
is a general overview of such rules:

a) _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called_
"estate debts," have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and
enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the
realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

b) _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether_
by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

c) _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social_
security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor.

d) _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests_
and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver
among the unsecured creditors (and secured/privileged creditors if the security/privilege did not allow them
to be paid in full) who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

e) Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group company
must fall within the grantor's legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the Belgian Guarantor
and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules.

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts
and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral
for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on
this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing
factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would
actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and collateral.
It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company
resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the
company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group
transaction is within the individual group member's corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the management
of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company's management will be subject to only a
"marginal review" by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical
view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors or managers of the company may be held liable
under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal
law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as "abuse of company goods"
(misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared
null and void. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate
benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market
practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain "limitation language" in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation
language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language
is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

The limitation language applicable to any Belgian Guarantor which will be included in the Indenture will
substantially be in the following form:

a) "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the guarantee, indemnity and other obligations
of any Belgian Guarantor under this Agreement shall be limited to a maximum amount equal to the greater
of: (i) an amount equal to 85% of that Belgian Guarantor's net assets, as calculated on the basis of its most


-----

recent audited annual financial statements at the time the relevant demand is made and (ii) the outstanding
amount of any intra-group loans, advances or facilities made to that Belgian Guarantor by any other member
of the Group directly and/or indirectly using all or part of the proceeds of the Notes (whether or not such
intra-group loan is retained by the relevant Belgian Guarantor for its own purposes or on-lent) at the time the
relevant demand is made, and in any case the total liability of any Belgian Guarantor shall at all times be
limited to the extent it would constitute unlawful financial assistance in accordance with article 5:152, article
6:118 or article 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.

b) Any payment made by the Belgian Guarantor under this Section and any proceeds received by the Trustee
and/or the Security Agent in connection with any Transaction Security granted by such Belgian Guarantor
shall reduce the guaranteed amount determined in accordance with the formula in paragraph a) above.

c) For the purposes of this Section, the net assets of a Belgian Guarantor means its "netto actief"/"actif net," as
defined in Articles 320 and/or 617 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, as amended or
superseded."

**_Representative of Secured Creditors_**

Since there is no established concept of "trust" or "trustee" under the present Belgian legal system, the nature,
effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for holders of the Notes
in respect of security interests such as pledges are debated and may not be effective or enforceable under Belgian law.
Pursuant to Belgian law, security is an "accessory" which must be granted to the same person to whom the secured
debt is owed, except in the case of financial collateral within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or
collateral subject to Book III, Chapter XVII 'Security on movable assets' of the Belgian civil code, as amended from
time to time, introduced by the law of July 11, 2013 on taking security on moveable assets, as amended from time to
time ("Belgian Act on Security over Movable Assets").

Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of the Belgian Guarantor) will be granted to the
Security Agent acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act. Belgian pledges over movable assets (including receivables) will be granted to the Security Agent
acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties pursuant to Article 3 of the Belgian Act on Security over
Movable Assets. These provisions allow for the creation of security over financial collateral and over movable assets,
respectively, held by an agent acting as representative for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be
determined on the basis of the security agreement.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, certain transactions that have been
concluded or performed by the debtor during the "hardening period" may be declared ineffective against third parties.
In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have
occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on
serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not
be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates
to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances
suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be
the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the
declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the "hardening period" (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective
against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others: (i) gratuitous
transactions or transactions where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the act or asset
provided by the debtor; (ii) payments for debts that are not yet due; (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due; and
(iv) new security provided for preexisting debts.

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against
third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor's cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the consideration
received is considerably below the value of the guarantee or security interests provided, (ii) the beneficiaries of the
guarantee or security interests were aware of the company's cessation of payments or (iii) it is granted for preexisting
debts.


-----

If the Guarantee or security interests granted by a Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the
above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to
repay any amounts received pursuant to such Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests.

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Enterprise Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor
may obtain a court ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish
that the challenged act or transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an
existing creditor (actio pauliana), irrespective of its date.

**England and Wales**

One of the Guarantors is a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the "English Obligor").
Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligor would likely be based on English insolvency laws.
However, as discussed in the section "—European Union" above, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and, where
a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union, any main insolvency
proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member State in which its COMI is
located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, subject to the
laws of that Member State. Equally, even though the Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, it is possible
that it (or other Guarantors) could be subject to English insolvency proceedings. Although the factors English courts assess
when determining whether they have jurisdiction vary for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and
Wales, English courts do have the ability to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings. However, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent
of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

Similarly, the U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Cross-Border Insolvency (the "Model Law") in the United Kingdom, which provides legislative provisions to deal with
the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions), Implementation of the Model Law has
been adopted without a requirement of reciprocity. Under national law implementing the Model Law, a foreign court may
recognize certain U.K. insolvency proceedings as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is
determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another
jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). Under the Model Law, an "establishment" is
defined to mean a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where the entity carries out non-transitory economic
activities with human means and assets or services. Furthermore, the U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide
that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main
proceedings where any English company has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non-main proceedings
where it has an "establishment" in such foreign jurisdiction. As such, should the English Obligor have its COMI in a country
other than the United Kingdom, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the
English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be foreign non-main proceedings and would be
limited to the assets that the English Obligor has in the United Kingdom. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings,
an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply on a temporary basis
to prevent certain types of creditor action in the United Kingdom, including commencement of proceedings concerning the
debtor's assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor's rights to enforce security
over the debtor's property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies in
relation to foreign non-main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and
Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for
administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a "qualifying floating charge" (discussed below) making
an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company
resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency
law. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees
and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive
in an insolvency of the Issuer or a Guarantor (to the extent applicable).

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The Insolvency Act has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a
company's 'inability to pay its debts' as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency
Act, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if it
fails to satisfy a creditor's statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or if it fails to satisfy in
full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order); (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is


-----

unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 empower British courts to
make an administration order with respect to companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales or Scotland,
companies incorporated under the laws of an EEA member state, companies not incorporated under the laws of an EEA
member state but having their COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark), companies (wherever incorporated) having
their COMI in the United Kingdom and companies (wherever incorporated) having their COMI in a Member State (other
than Denmark) and an establishment (see "—European Union" above) in the United Kingdom. Subject to specific
conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to
become "unable to pay its debts" (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a "qualifying
floating charge" (discussed below)) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of
administration.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the
holder of a qualifying floating charge (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also
appoint an administrator via an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The
purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company
as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole
than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests
of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more
secured or preferential creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory
moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce
security or a guarantee over the company's property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court.
The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal
proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of
administration described above.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer or the Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced against that company while it was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent,
as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of the Issuer or relevant
Guarantor (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the
administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain
requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property that is
either not subject to security, or is subject to a floating charge - however an administrator may only dispose of property of
a company subject to a fixed charge with the leave of the court or with the consent of the secured creditor). The
administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. A secured creditor cannot appoint an
administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the
exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency
Act), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative
receiver.

However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator
or permission of the court, and the administrator's powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, does not
apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial
Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (UK) (the "Financial Collateral Regulations"). A
financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest (including a floating charge,
a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) over financial collateral (including cash or financial instruments, such as
shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral
taker are non-natural persons.

Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be extended
by court order or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors). The Issuer or the Guarantors may exit
administration if the administrator is satisfied that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon
application to and subsequent order of the court if the administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume


-----

normal business upon exiting administration. However, the administrator also has the power, should he or she conclude
that there is no reasonable prospect of rescuing the company, to either place the company into liquidation or use the powers
granted to administrators under, and in accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company's assets and thereby
achieve substantially the same result as a liquidation.

**_Administrative Receivership and Receivership_**

There are, broadly speaking, two different types of receiver: An "administrative receiver" (being a receiver or
manager of the whole or substantially the whole of a company's property appointed by a holder of a charge which was
created as a floating charge, or by such a charge and one or more other forms of security and who normally takes over the
running of the company's business) and a receiver (often described as a "fixed charge receiver"). The latter are not
administrative receivers and are mostly used to sell land or other specific assets subject to a fixed charge. The contexts
within which each would be appointed are described below.

If a company registered in England and Wales grants a "qualifying floating charge" to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver provided the qualifying floating charge
pre-dates September 15, 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the
appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating
charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a
qualifying floating charge if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge
which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating
charges which together relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; or (c) by charges and
other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property and at least
one of which is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to "capital market arrangements" (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A
of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant
English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a "capital market investment"
(which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically provided
for in English law-governed security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under section 101 of the Law of
Property Act 1925 for the holder of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to appoint a receiver
over the charged assets to collect the income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction of the secured debt.

A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the relevant security documentation which typically
provide for the ability of secured creditors to appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in
accordance with their terms. Once appointed, the receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The security document pursuant
to which the receiver is appointed will typically set out the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these powers
will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged assets, with the proceeds being used to pay the secured
creditors.

An administrative receiver's and, typically, a receiver's primary duty is to realize secured assets and pay the
proceeds to the relevant secured creditors, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the
Prescribed Part (discussed below)). Both an administrator receiver and a receiver, however, also owe a duty to the company,
in particular to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable at the relevant time when selling any asset.

There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are
consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are
subject to valid retention of title claims and terminating contracts. If a company is already in administration, the moratorium
on creditor action will prevent the appointment of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the
administrator consents or the court permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by
the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which
the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an
invalid floating charge. In contrast the appointment of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the
appointment of an administrator.

If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed over
part of the company's property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed


-----

under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial
Collateral Regulations.

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency
Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary
liquidation, by resolution of the company's members, which is in turn divided into members' voluntary liquidation ("MVL")
(which can only be proposed by a solvent company) and creditors' voluntary liquidation ("CVL"). A CVL (other than as
an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to
some degree of control by the creditors. A creditor, the company or in certain circumstances a shareholder, among others,
can present a winding-up petition to the court for the compulsory winding-up of a company. The primary ground for the
compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above) or that the court
is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company via compulsory liquidation if it is a company registered
in England and Wales or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with its COMI in an EU
member state (other than Denmark) and an "establishment" in England and Wales or (iii) in the case of an unregistered
foreign company, if it has enough of a "sufficient connection" with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its
jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject
to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state
(except Denmark) but which has an "establishment" in England and Wales) may enter a creditors' voluntary liquidation).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a
compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company's property made
after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any
property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a "financial collateral
arrangement" under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in
accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the
court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up
order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued
or commenced against the company without permission of the court.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up
order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of
Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important
because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their
security.

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass
a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five
weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating
that, after having made full enquiry into the company's affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its
debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding twelve months from the
start of the liquidation.

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court
involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL
(meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the
shareholders, the creditors' choice will prevail.

On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors' powers to bind the company automatically cease, save for those
powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other things, the power
to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is
necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company's property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property
that is secured by a fixed charge in favor of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor's consent, it will be
made subject to that security, as the creditor's consent will be needed to release the security), and execute documents in the
name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.


-----

Under English insolvency law, with some exceptions, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property,
which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise
to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective
liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this
power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued
rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect
of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral
arrangement.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

A company voluntary arrangement ("CVA") is a procedure intended to allow companies to avoid potentially
terminal insolvency proceedings and to address their financial difficulties by obtaining a binding agreement or compromise
with their unsecured creditors. Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the
supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the
supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in
order to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors.

A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding
legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a member state of the EEA or (iii) if the company
is not incorporated in a member state of the EEA but has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) or in the
United Kingdom. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company's directors (if the relevant company is not in
administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the administrator or the
liquidator (as applicable).

The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company's unsecured debts,
but may also form part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different creditor groups.

A CVA requires the approval of a majority of 75% or more in value of the creditors of the company present in
person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, a
resolution approving a CVA will be invalid if those creditors voting against it include more than 50% in value of all the
creditors who are unconnected with the relevant company. A CVA will bind all unsecured creditors of a company who
were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure,
subject to the right that creditors have to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a CVA in certain circumstances.
Additionally, a CVA will not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors without their consent.

A CVA also requires the approval of more than 50% in value of the company's members present in person or by
proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome
of the meeting of members differs from the outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail.
Like creditors, members also have the right to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary
arrangement in certain circumstances.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one
of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and
distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company's creditors.

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds
from the realization of the insolvent company's property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the
exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the
claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the
company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to
each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers
that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal
and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a
proprietary interest;


-----

    - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate, e.g. any prescribed fees or expenses of the official
receiver, moratorium debts, (in certain circumstances) certain "priority pre-moratorium debts" and
expenses of the liquidation or administration (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of
priority in which expenses are paid);

    - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

        - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company
in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries
of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of
£800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated,
whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and
building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
("FSCS") up to the statutory limit.

        - Secondary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) (i) bank and building deposits
eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit;
and (ii) VAT, PAYE, income tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme
deductions and other certain tax debts (excluding corporation tax and employers' NI
contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers) due to HM
Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"), as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6
of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential
debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally;

    - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security.

        - This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that
created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before
distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined
below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

    - Fifth ranking:

        - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under
section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among
themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the
secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations
from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the
Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors;

        - secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable
contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of
liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration, which preceded such liquidation.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees,
such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

        - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully
paid; and

    - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant
documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act).

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge


-----

realizations) (the "Prescribed Part"). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the
company's net property and 20% of the remainder of the company's net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate
cap of £800,000 (except where the company's net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part
must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit
to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed
Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including an administrative receiver) to set aside a
Prescribed Part of the company's property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured
creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described
in the Financial Collateral Regulations).

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date when the company went
into liquidation or administration (or where a liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, the rate
prevailing on the date that the company entered administration). This provision overrides any agreement between the
parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the Issuer or such Guarantor (as applicable) goes
into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any
losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security and Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security
and guarantees, or the entry by a company into a transaction, can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the
English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period following the relevant act. Therefore,
if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a company, the administrator or liquidator may
challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given, or certain transactions entered into, by such company, and, as
such, it cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of the English Obligor's insolvency is within any of the requisite
time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged
or that a court would uphold a transaction as valid.

**_Reviewable Transactions_**

There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior to a
company's insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238);
(ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding
creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the
exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an
undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a
transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value
of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money's worth) of the consideration
provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency
(as described below)); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company
which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did
so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as
it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction (which may
include the setting aside of any security interests or guarantees granted). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a
Connected Person (as defined in "England and Wales—Connected Persons" below), in which case there is a presumption
of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of
the transaction and did not become unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on,
any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will
not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and
for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from
the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the
person was a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on
the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company's creditors, a surety or a
guarantor for any of the company's debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something
to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the
company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been
done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position
than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the
case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the
insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the
company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

The desire to prefer requires a positive wish to improve the creditor's position in the event of the company's
insolvent liquidation. A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a
company is influenced only by proper commercial considerations there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable
preference.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore
the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which could include reducing
payments under or setting aside the relevant Notes, Guarantees and Collateral (although there is certain protection for a
third party who enters into a transaction in good faith and without notice). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire
to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such
beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company
intended to put that person in a better position and the Connected Person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such
desire on the part of the company to prefer them.

An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether
or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and
for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a
preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company.

_Invalid floating charges_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over
its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a Connected Person, this means
within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months
before the onset of insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid
except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists


-----

of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of,
or after the creation of, the charge, the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at
the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company, and the amount of the interest on any
such amounts in pursuance of any agreement under which the money was so paid, the goods or services were so supplied
or the debt was so discharged or reduced. No court action is required.

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial
collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to appoint
an administrator out of court or through the less onerous in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the
holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held
invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and
(ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim
against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a
preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a
"victim" of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore
limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K.
Prudential Regulation Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time
limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no
defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors
or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely
to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect
the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation
on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will
not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for
value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or
administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transactions_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its
terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of
the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless
otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator
makes an application to set aside as an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three
years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different
to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). That order may
set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties).
It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may
require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and
it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no
provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in an extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the
benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).


-----

_Orders_

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e., not section 245), the court has
very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the
transaction was entered into.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a "Connected Person," then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge
by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A "Connected Person" of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at
an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the company, (ii) a shadow
director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual's husband,
wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner
of a relative of the individual, or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil
partner.

A person is an associate of any person with whom they are in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil partner
or relative of any individual with whom they are in partnership.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case, directors of a
company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom they employ. A
company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are their
associates together have control of it.

A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or (ii) it is
controlled by a person and that person's associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is controlled by a group of
two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be
regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a
person of whom they are an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with their directions or instructions, or they
are entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the
company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these
conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order
is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the
appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court,
whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

**_Recharacterization of Fixed Security Interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that any of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
Security Documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as
fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests
rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree
of control over the chargor's ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control
is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a


-----

purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts
to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its
receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent
of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured
creditors of the English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property which is ring fenced (see explanation
of the Prescribed Part above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over
the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the
expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge
holder. It may also prevent the holder relying on that charge to appoint a receiver.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by the English Obligor in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the aforementioned do not allow such an action,
there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective
creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligor
in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit
must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to
promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction
where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides
that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While
the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the English court has recently held that
the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become
insolvent, with "likely" in this context meaning "probable."

Security and/or Guarantees granted by the English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the
extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to U.K. company law.

Under U.K. company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated
in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of
the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of
creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English
companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security
becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable.
In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and
allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the
Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need
to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required
depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Security over Assets (including shares)_**

Security (other than by way of a legal mortgage) over assets (including shares of an English company) granted by
the English Obligor or over assets of the English Obligor are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An
equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee and/or transfers
the beneficial interest in the property to the chargee but retains legal title to the property. Remedies in relation to equitable
charges may be subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured
parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company
statutes in respect of persons with significant control.


-----

In addition, the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (the "NSIA") came into force in January 2022 as the
United Kingdom's new national security screening regime. The NSIA gives the UK government powers to scrutinize and
intervene in transactions where control over certain entities or assets has been or will be "acquired" and this may give rise
to a national security risk in the United Kingdom. The powers are broad and could affect lenders and security agents when
taking and enforcing security over shares or assets, particularly in the 17 designated sensitive sectors.

**_Financial Collateral Regulations_**

The Financial Collateral Regulations apply in respect of certain security interests granted over, and certain title
transfer arrangements in, "financial collateral" (together, "financial collateral arrangements"). Financial collateral is
defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of "financial
instruments" includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds. The definition of “credit claims” includes
claims under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was
to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral
arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the United Kingdom. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of
taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations certain
modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply
provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency officeholder of the
financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral
Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the
statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration
proceedings and furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to
appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interests applies
without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms
and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an "Account Charge") granted by the English Obligor, the
banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an "Account Bank") may hold a right at any time (at least prior
to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to
which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that Guarantor. As a result, and if the security
granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts
will be subject to the relevant Account Bank's rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts
charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as
it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the English Obligor) and the Account
Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank's netting
and set-off rights.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, which permits
a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or any class of them).

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company's
liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under
the Insolvency Act and, in the context of a non-English company, (ii) has "sufficient connection" to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to
be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company's COMI is in England, the company's finance documents are English
law governed, or the company's finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by
English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in any given case.

English courts are unlikely to sanction a scheme for a foreign company where to do so would be in vain and they
will want to ensure that a proposed scheme will be recognized in jurisdictions outside of England and Wales, as relevant.
The English court has previously sanctioned schemes where expert evidence was provided showing that it is more likely
than not that the scheme would be recognized in each jurisdiction where the company has material assets or liabilities.
However, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily
determine whether or not this test would be satisfied in any given case.


-----

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights
of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the
scheme. Classes must be comprised of those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them
to consult together with a view to their common interest. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors.
If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each
class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including
those affected creditors who did not participate in voting and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs
to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider
whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order
conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. If sanctioned by the court, a scheme will be binding on
each relevant class of creditors (both secured and unsecured) and members including any dissenting or abstaining party.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the Recast Insolvency Regulation on the basis
that they are not considered to be 'insolvency' proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially
distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of
the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the "Brussels Regulation") was commonly relied upon as a basis on
which recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning the scheme could be obtained in each Member State.

The Brussels Regulation ceased to apply to the United Kingdom on December 31, 2020, meaning that an
alternative avenue of recognition for schemes is now required. Such avenues include recognition on the basis of the private
international law of the relevant Member States or through the following instruments which, together, provide that schemes
should still be recognized in Member States notwithstanding that the United Kingdom no longer benefits from the Brussels
Regulation:

    - Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the "Hague Convention"): where
parties have stipulated an exclusive choice of court agreement in their contracts, the Hague Convention
requires that the parties' decision and choice of court be respected. It further provides that any judgment
rendered by the chosen court will be recognized and enforced in other signatory states. While the Hague
Convention may allow for a scheme which seeks to compromise contractual arrangements which contain
an exclusive choice of court agreement in favor of the Courts of the United Kingdom to be recognized in
other signatory states, it does not apply to “insolvency, composition and analogous matters”; therefore,
its application to schemes is not certain. The United Kingdom ceased to be a signatory of the Hague
Convention (via its membership of the EU) on December 31, 2020, but acceded as a signatory in its own
right as of January 1, 2021.

    - Bilateral treaties: some Member States have their own laws, or bilateral treaties with the U.K., that might
enable recognition of an English scheme. However the number of these Member States is limited and the
application of these laws and treaties to schemes is untested.

    - The Rome regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations ((EC) No 593/2008) ("Rome I"):
allows parties to a contract to choose the law governing contractual obligations and applies in all Member
States (except Denmark). Following December 31, 2020, Rome I will continue to be applicable in respect
of recognition by Member States (except Denmark) of judgments given in the Courts of the United
Kingdom, allowing parties to choose the law applicable to the contracts and for the choice of law to be
respected in all Member States. In the context of English law governed debt that is compromised under
an English scheme, Rome I will allow the relevant scheme order to be recognized throughout the EU.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 ("CIGA 2020") enacted fundamental
reforms to the United Kingdom's existing insolvency and companies legislation.

_Moratorium_

Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit
certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space
to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a 'debtor-in-possession' process, meaning that a company


-----

in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency
practitioner, called a 'monitor'. Despite the existence of a "payment holiday" in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts
which exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the
moratorium is in force under obligations incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as "priority pre-moratorium
debts"), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan
agreements and other financial services contracts.

Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of
exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt
incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the
life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes,
amongst other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed
to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors.

_Ipso facto clauses prohibited_

CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the
imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the
counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and
administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other
than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the
termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the
contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being
satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and entities
involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition.

_Restructuring plan_

CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies
Act 2006 (see "England and Wales—Scheme of Arrangement"), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind
dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. This new standalone restructuring plan under Part 26A of the
Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of
State is given the express power to exclude regulated companies providing financial services from being able to propose a
restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may
be party to a restructuring plan.

The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will
or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with
its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating
the effect of such financial difficulties. Save as set out above, there are no additional financial eligibility criteria, thereby
making restructuring plans available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the restructuring plan
would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency office holder). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks
after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see above), any creditors in respect of "moratorium debts" and "priority
pre-moratorium debts" (see "—Moratorium") may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the
restructuring plan without their consent.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be
filed at court as part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing,
the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed
restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of
each class of creditors/members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every
stakeholder in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of
the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the
like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise
arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant meeting, unless they have been excluded by reason of having
no genuine economic interest in the company.

The creditors/members of a class are deemed to approve a restructuring plan if at least 75% in value of the
creditors/members of that class who are present and voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in favor of the proposals.
Unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in number of those creditors present and voting
to vote in favor of a restructuring plan for class approval to be given.


-----

As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme of arrangement does not have, a
"cross-class cram down" provision. This allows the court to sanction a restructuring plan even if not all of the relevant
classes of creditors and/or members have voted in favor of it. In order for the court to sanction a cross-class cram down the
court must be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event
of the "relevant alternative" (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company
if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and that the plan has been agreed by 75% in value of a class of creditors or
members present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in
the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan then needs
to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court's
discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse
to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable.

Parties' rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous
rights will be extinguished.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on
claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see above) to provide protection pending the
sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible.

As above, the Hague Convention contains exclusions whereby it is deemed not to apply to judgments handed
down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands, the English Court considers that restructuring
plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a company must have encountered or be likely to encounter
financial difficulties in order to propose a restructuring plan. The recognition of a restructuring plan in Member States
therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those Member States, and may be less straightforward than the
recognition of a scheme of arrangement.

_So-called "Henry VIII" powers_

CIGA 2020 further confers on the U.K. government some extensive powers to make a range of further
amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may
be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or
the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities.

**Finland**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries are incorporated and have their centre of main interests in Finland. In the event
of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be
governed by Finnish law. In case of insolvency proceedings connected to another EU member state within the meaning of
regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that
said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended), the Finnish Restructuring
of Enterprises Act (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended, the "Finnish Restructuring Act") and the Finnish
Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään, 758/1991, as amended,
the "Finnish Recovery Act") are particularly relevant to this discussion.

Under Finnish law, if a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, the company may be the subject
of two alternative types of proceedings: company restructuring (yrityssaneeraus) and bankruptcy (konkurssi). Further, the
company restructuring proceedings may be divided into standard restructuring proceedings (perusmuotoinen
_saneerausmenettely) described below more in detail and early restructuring proceedings (varhainen saneerausmenettely)._
Liquidation proceedings (selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended) generally
concern only solvent companies as there is an obligation to conclude liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the
full settlement of all of the company's debts is not possible in liquidation.

**_Company Restructuring_**

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring
proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for company
restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with the Finnish


-----

Restructuring Act. Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible - in theory, irrespective of the
company's solvency situation - when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor's
known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the
debtor's application for company restructuring.

If no statutory barriers to restructuring under the Finnish Restructuring Act are established and, consequently, the
court approves the application and opens restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a restructuring
administrator (selvittäjä). The purpose of a company restructuring is to investigate whether the business has a reasonable
chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company's viable business, ensure its continued viability and make debt
arrangements with creditors and execute other measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to
act on behalf of the company during the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the
company's books and business documents and obtain any information on the company's business activities, as well as to
participate in meetings of the debtor's corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator's consent is required to certain legal
acts of a significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act.

The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor's existing contracts
(though restructuring debts deriving from such contracts may obviously be reorganized). However, there are some
exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act regarding premature termination of certain contracts, such as lease
agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor, contracts pursuant to which
the debtor is obliged to make performances of non-monetary nature repeatedly or continuously (e.g., supply agreement),
and employment relationships.

_Moratorium_

Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the company that have arisen before the filing of the
restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension prohibits
the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising
after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced), and the seizure of assets. The court
may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such prohibitions are in effect on an interim basis as of a date
even prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e., shortly after the filing of the application for the
restructuring proceedings). The suspensions are in force until the restructuring program has been approved by the district
court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted.

Debts arising after the filing of the application must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees,
charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a continuous
contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the application.

_Debt arrangements_

Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts (i.e., debts that
have arisen before the filing of the application) within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with
respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt
payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second;
(iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv)
reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial
refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that
are considered reasonable having regard to the creditor's position and field of business.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest
to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the commencement
of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor's claim after the deduction of liquidation
costs and claims with a higher priority. The part of the claim that is not covered by the value of the security is regarded as
unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of
the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value of the property will be determined by the restructuring
program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii)
ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs
second; and (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt.
The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured debt as a lump sum payment funded
by the issuance of new debt.


-----

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor's security right, the security
arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within
a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the
debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other
credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into consideration in the restructuring program, so
that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.

_Approval of the restructuring program_

The draft of the restructuring program will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will
approve it subject to the acceptance of all the creditors or of the majority in each group of creditors. However, there are
some specific limitations under the Finnish Restructuring Act which apply even if the restructuring program is approved
by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore, even if the majority does not exist in one or several
groups of creditors, the restructuring program may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared
the draft, the administrator or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act. In such a case the
restructuring claims of the creditors in favor of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all known restructuring
claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring
Act and at least one group of creditors must have voted for approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also
submit a proposal to the court with respect to the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its discretion.

_Early restructuring proceedings_

In addition to what has been described above in respect of standard restructuring proceedings, debtors facing
impending insolvency also have an option under the Finnish Restructuring Act to apply for the commencement of early
restructuring proceedings. Early restructuring proceedings are more easily accessible to debtors, as the commencement of
such proceedings does not require that the relevant debtor would already be insolvent (e.g. impending insolvency (uhkaava
_maksukyvyttömyys)_ being the requirement) and creditors have more restricted rights to object to the commencement of such
proceedings. The initiation of early insolvency proceedings by the creditors is not possible.

The court deciding on the commencement of early insolvency proceedings may prohibit the placing of any security
and payment of any existing debt as described under "Moratorium" above. However, in early restructuring proceedings,
such restrictions have to be ordered by the court deciding on the restructuring application and such restrictions are in effect
as of the date when such restrictions have been ordered. Such moratorium may remain in force for up three months which
period may be extended by the court to up to twelve months based on an application from either the debtor, the administrator
or a creditor. In case the debtor is later found insolvent, the administrator (if appointed) may with the consensus of the
debtor and creditors representing at least one-fifth of the debtor's known debts apply for a transfer to standard restructuring
proceedings.

In general, the content and process of the early restructuring proceedings is by large similar to standard
restructuring proceedings.

**_Bankruptcy_**

A debtor or a qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent jurisdiction when the debtor
is unable to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary, i.e. considered to be insolvent. If the application is
approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and
use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors' claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional situations)
continue the company's business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as it is reasonably
possible. The debtor's assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator.
The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit
of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decisionmaking powers of the creditors.

_Notices to the bankruptcy estate with regard to claims_

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a
"lodgment of claim") with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator. Information concerning
the deadline is sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official gazette of Finland
(Virallinen lehti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is mandatory even for a creditor with a secured


-----

claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of,
and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and collateral as
should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor, as referred to
in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (Yrityskiinnityslaki, 634/1984, as amended), as security for a claim shall file the
claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro
for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the
bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim letter.

_Disbursements_

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors
("draft disbursement list"). The court verifies that the estate administrator's disbursement list meets the statutory
requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft disbursement list have been observed.

The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the amount
of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on Order of Payment of the
Creditors (Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä, 1578/1992, as amended), the following creditors have priority over
unsecured creditors in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage)
and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset; (ii) the administrative
expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has
entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen
between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone
restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with penalty
interest incurred until the time of payment of the fees and expenses and after satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors
of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; and (iv) claims that
are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets.

Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims
are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy and a loan or
a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding
taxes and other fiscal charges.

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the
aggregate net proceeds, including by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers.
However, creditors that have an interest in collateral may exercise their right of liquidation of collateral regardless of the
bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a
maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected
by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate,
assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code
(Ulosottokaari, 705/2007, as amended, the "Finnish Enforcement Code") if the bailiff consents to the same.

**_Recovery of Assets_**

Pursuant to the Finnish Recovery Act, certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked if the rights of creditors
have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code, the
grounds for recovery set forth in the Finnish Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and
enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company restructuring and certain creditors may
seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement proceedings.
The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor's
counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from
the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate has
discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company restructuring program, the
administrator must file an action within one year from the commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three
months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who
becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five
years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or


-----

relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself
or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property
beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the
transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a
contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency
or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor's economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew
or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper.
The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Finnish Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between
the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified
knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal)
persons within the debtor's sphere of interest (as defined in the Finnish Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the
date of the transaction.

Pursuant to the Finnish Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless
of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii)
the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company
restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person
within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used;
(ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor.
However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as
customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring
or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the
debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in
connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act
perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the debtor or
the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. In the case of company restructuring, the returned property is to be
held separately from the debtor's other assets and, after payment of the expenses resulting from the recovery, the returned
property shall be used in accordance with the restructuring program. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the
compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors
and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no
obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable,
compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause
inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of
the property instead of returning the property. The Finnish Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for
any decrease in value of the returnable property.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security_**

The Guarantees and any security granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Finland (each a "Finnish Guarantor")
will be limited by a general limitation that limits the scope of the guarantee and security to the extent the grant of such
guarantee or security would be contrary to certain mandatory provisions of the Finnish Companies Act. Pursuant to such
limitation, the beneficiaries of any such Guarantee or security agree to enforce the relevant Guarantee or security against
the relevant Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory
regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. Such mandatory limitations to a company's ability to
grant guarantees and third-party security are included in Sections 1 and 10 of Chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act
regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a
Finnish limited liability company is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a
third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, under Finnish law if a company undertakes
a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that deviate to
the detriment of the company from arms' length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit distribution. The
Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a
Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so is in the company's own commercial
interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant circumstances, benefits and
risks to the company (on a standalone basis, and any group benefit being taken into account only if and to the extent it
directly or indirectly benefits the company itself) are to be taken into account. In the context of the guarantee or security,
among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by a Finnish Guarantor for the other financing
arrangements of the group companies in connection with the issue of the Notes are to be taken into consideration. The
actual scope of the guarantee and security granted by a Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the
aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application


-----

of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee and security, no liabilities or
obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed and secured.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, security
agreements and guarantees to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security is contractually
limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Guarantees granted
by the Finnish Guarantors and the Security Documents under which any security have been granted by the Finnish
Guarantors contain such limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of
such Guarantees and security agree to enforce the relevant Guarantee and security against the relevant Finnish Guarantor
only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies
Act by that Finnish Guarantor.

**_Creation of a Valid Security Interest_**

Other than in respect of the creation of registered mortgages over assets belonging to certain specific asset classes
(such as real estate, qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject of registered security,
the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by pledging the security assets and
perfecting such pledge, typically, in respect of movable assets (including shares, in case share certificates evidencing such
shares have been issued, and business mortgage notes), by transferring such security assets into the exclusive physical
possession of the pledgee or, in respect of receivables and bank accounts (and shares, in case share certificates have not
been issued in respect of such shares), by notifying the person from whom the receivable is owed or the relevant account
bank, or the company whose shares have been pledged, of the creation of the pledge over the relevant receivables or shares.
In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or
dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains
entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be
deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event.
Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be
set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time period before the commencement of insolvency
proceedings.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the involvement of an
enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement. A pledge of shares is typically
enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable or by the secured creditor collecting
payment of the receivable. Typically, collection of receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in more
expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the
debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the district court in order to
obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement. In the case of a bank account, the
pledge would be enforced by the creditor withdrawing the funds from the account and applying such funds towards the
secured obligations.The Finnish Commercial Code (Kauppakaari, 3/1734, as amended) stipulates a default process in
respect of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties' discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory invalidity
of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically transfer to the pledgee
(however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the security, effectively agree that
an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee
always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly
jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

A pledge of business mortgage notes may outside bankruptcy proceedings be enforced only through the public enforcement
procedure set forth in the Finnish Enforcement Code. The creditor must first seek to obtain a court judgment or an arbitral
award confirming the debtor's obligation to repay the debt. The enforcement of the court judgment or arbitral award is then
carried out by a bailiff. Either the bailiff decides which property covered by the business mortgage will be sold in the
auction or alternatively, the creditor may directly in the court proceedings rely on the business mortgage and petition to a
specified property covered by the business mortgage. In the latter case, the court would order the specific property covered
by the business mortgage to be sold by the bailiff in the auction. The sale may also be conducted by other means (such as
a sale organized by a private auctioneer or other sale than a public auction organized by the bailiff). It should be noted that
in the enforcement procedure, the priority of the holder of a business mortgage over the unsecured debtors is up to the full
net realization value of the mortgaged property, whereas in bankruptcy proceedings the priority is limited to 50 per cent.


-----

**_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_**

It is generally possible under Finnish law to grant guarantees and security interests in favor of the secured parties
represented by an agent acting on behalf of the secured parties. The concept of trust does not exist under Finnish law and
unless the trustee is treated as the agent of the secured parties, the security will be invalid should Finnish law be deemed
applicable.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and
substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. Consequently, under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, absent any change in circumstances, their centre of main interests at the time of an application for the opening
of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is likely to be in Germany, and insolvency proceedings are likely
to be initiated in Germany, in which case German insolvency law would govern such proceedings. Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of
companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is
within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the certain German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The
insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the
insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors' claims, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest as well as certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors, security interests and the
duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent
exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding
for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these
insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In
particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group.

The German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung
_der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides_
for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies as well as the concentration of
proceedings at the same court. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent
group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the
respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to
facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity
insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is
facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors'
committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for "coordination proceedings" (Koordinationsverfahren) and the
appointment of a "coordination insolvency administrator" (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a
"coordination plan" (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency
proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the
debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities
exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor's business is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive
_Fortführungsprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to_
Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Anpassungsanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur
_Abmilderung von Krisenfolgen) (the "SanInsKG"), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced_
to four (4) months until December 31, 2023. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more
of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close
the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the
payments owed by such debtor. If a company limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH),
a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a German stock corporation


-----

(Aktiengesellschaft) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid and/or
over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, (i) in the case of illiquidity at the latest within 3
weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason of, illiquidity occurred and (ii) in case of over indebtedness within 6 weeks
(which period is temporarily extended to eight weeks applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 until December
31, 2023 according to the SanInsKG) after the mandatory insolvency reason of over-indebtedness occurred. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. Moreover, once illiquidity or over-indebtedness has occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes,
may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under
German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably
(predominantly likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such
period generally being 24 months). However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is
entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Proceedings are generally split into two distinct phases: Preliminary insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren) and formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren).

Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige
_Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The_
insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets during
these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court usually also appoints a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung). The
debtor-in-possession proceeding is an insolvency process in which the debtor's management generally remains in charge
of administering the debtor's business affairs under the supervision of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter),
provided that, _inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration plan_
(Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession status and no circumstances are known which
indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on inaccurate facts. During preliminary insolvency
proceedings, depending on the size of the debtor's business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a
preliminary creditors' committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession
status, or on the profile of the preliminary insolvency administrator or the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members
of the preliminary creditors' committee unanimously agree on an individual, as candidate for that role, such suggestion is
binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not impartial). To ensure that
the preliminary creditors' committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of
the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The court
may add a representative for other creditor constituencies as well. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator
are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor's assets (which may include the continuation of the business
carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor's net assets will
be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to
manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured
creditors against the debtor.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at_
least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency
court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In
the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency
of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse) following which the company will, inter alia, be deemed dissolved and put into
liquidation.

Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the
same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor in
possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the
debtor's business affairs and to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as
insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors' assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change
requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the
proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e.,
sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator has full administrative and
disposal authority of the debtor's assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency
administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial


-----

indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency
administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any
insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or "ipso facto clauses" entitling
one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the
opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they
frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des
_Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to_
agreements that are not governed by German law.

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of any opening of formal insolvency proceedings
against a subsidiary of the Issuer (assuming the applicability of the German insolvency regime) would be the following:

    - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of assets of such subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

    - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such subsidiary
of the Issuer, disposals effected by the management of such subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

    - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing of a petition for insolvency proceedings or
thereafter, a creditor of such subsidiary of the Issuer in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through
execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in any part of such subsidiary of the Issuer's property that
forms part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

    - claims against such subsidiary of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

    - powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable
at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute
part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced
in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the
insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately,
but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).
Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an
automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to
enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors
have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to
enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be
noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor's
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security
transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are
entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged
assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf
of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. There is, however, no authoritative case law on this question.

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured
assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9%. of the gross enforcement proceeds (but can be
higher or lower) plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to


-----

an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator
has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings
as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings).
Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims - _Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency_
creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any),
will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse)
after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds
resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy e.g. unsecured creditors
under a Guarantee granted by any German Guarantor in full after the secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims
of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must
compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency
dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in
an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in
principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules.
Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it
will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap. Creditors
secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the
proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency
process.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor's assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as
the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor's business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation
of the debtor (i.e., the legal entity in case of a company) can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such
plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain
exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules
and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain
circumstances—be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the
membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., these can be transferred to third-parties,
including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or
over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove
that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to
three months to utilize up an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted
by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors' rights to enforce certain security may—upon application of the
filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to
supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion
being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is
obviously not competent or impartial).

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor
for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency
estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured
creditors.Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings,
the preliminary custodian) may avoid (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during
applicable avoidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the
insolvency administrator or preliminary custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such
challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator's or
preliminary custodian's right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having
occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes
and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a "shareholder like position" (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that
event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from note guarantees would
be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are
not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court
handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not
granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law.


-----

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries based on and
governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of
Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback
rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully avoided (angefochten), the
holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes or the Collateral and may participate
in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the Notes or the
Guarantees, the insolvency administrator of the payor may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency
estate and the recipient would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or the Guarantees without
preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of
a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided
according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases:

    - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt
(Befriedigung) can be avoided if the act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was cash
flow insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the
creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been
filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being cash flow insolvent (or knowledge of
circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow insolvency or filing);

    - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt
(Befriedigung) to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the
respective manner, can be avoided if the act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing; if the transaction was effected in the second
and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was
cash flow insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental
to the creditors of the debtor;

    - any legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors
of the debtor or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right, or by which a proprietary
claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable can be avoided if the transaction was effected
(i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was insolvent and the other party to
the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge
thereof or of the debtor being insolvent;

    - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt is regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be avoided unless it was effected earlier than
four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

    - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing
its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of
such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten year period is reduced to four years; "knowledge
by the beneficiary of the act" in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the "knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act" is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact
that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a
presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

    - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party (nahestehende Person)
which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was
concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors as
of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term 'affiliated party' includes,


-----

subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a claim (Befriedigung) of a shareholder for
repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be
avoided (i) in the event it provided security (Sicherung), if the transaction was effected within the last
ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the
event it provided satisfaction (Befriedigung), if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the
filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or

    - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition
for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security
or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder _Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to_
compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, "knowledge" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion
must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors,
as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if
he or she knew of the debtor's illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the
debtor's creditors. With respect to an "affiliated party", there is a general statutory presumption that such party had
"knowledge". The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a "cash transaction"
and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to avoidness rights under the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian avoiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could
possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law
of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings over the payor's assets. The prerequisites vary to
a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor
exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

To the extent possible the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal
creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied after the other claims of insolvency creditors have been satisfied in full in the order given below, and according
to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of
the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv)
claims to the debtor's gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan or claims
resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its
subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the relevant loan or legal transaction
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted the Preventive Restructuring Directive,
which aims to ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial
distress to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings.

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of
the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law
is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den
_Stabilisierungs und Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen) ("Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act"),_
which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany.

Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act ("Restructuring Proceedings") are initiated through
a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des
_Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and_
Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it


-----

is predominantly likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24
months. The debtor's management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring
Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met
(see above under "—Insolvency").

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor's liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor's liabilities,
only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and
depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and
the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding
on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group
of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain
tools to cover security provided to secure debts owed by the debtor and granted by entities that are connected entities
(verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a
respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the
mastering of group insolvencies (see above under "—Insolvency").

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a
debtor's liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or
maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted
for the benefit of the Notes by the respective debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring
plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities
of a debtors' creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The
adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights
approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the
case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is
formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors even if creditor class(es) have not
approved the plan, provided certain legal requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan
(cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so
as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization
order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can, among
other things, restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a
maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight
months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its centre of main interest in
Germany would be the following:

    - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the relevant Guarantor is potentially subject to no
or only limited review and/or supervision by a court;

    - restrictions may apply on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a
period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

    - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by a
restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a
deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the
security right);

    - any collateral granted by the relevant Guarantor as well as related intra-group collateral may be subject
to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

    - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the
Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any
EU member state pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament


-----

and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized
proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain
rules and regulations under applicable international private law and/or the applicable rules on the recognition of foreign
judgments.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The granting of Guarantees by the German subsidiary Guarantors is subject to certain limitations under German
law.

Any Guarantee granted by a German Guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in
Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—"GmbH") is subject to certain
provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter
_Haftung—"GmbHG")._

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG ("Sections 30 and 31") prohibit a GmbH from disbursing
its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e. assets minus
liabilities and liability reserves) determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its
registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security granted by a GmbH in
order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company or an affiliated company (verbundenes
_Unternehmen) of such shareholder within the meaning of section 15 et. seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act_
(Aktiengesetz) are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or a sister company or an affiliated company (verbundenes Unternehmen) of such shareholder within the
meaning of section 15 et. seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) without the risk of violating
Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability (as well as criminal prosecutions), it is standard
market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called "limitation language"
in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
enforcement of any subsidiary Guarantee or security given by the German subsidiary incorporated as a GmbH will be
limited if and to the extent payments (or security granting or enforcement) under any such subsidiary Guarantee (or
security) would cause the German subsidiary Guarantor's net assets to fall below, or increase an existing shortfall of, the
amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) (provided that the determination and
calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any Guarantee or security
provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in
Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described.

These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the right of payment and/or enforcement and would limit
the claim accordingly irrespective of the granting of the subsidiary Guarantee or security pursuant to the Indenture. This
could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that
future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German subsidiary Guarantors, which
can negatively affect the enforcement of the payment obligations under the German Guarantees and/or the ability of the
German subsidiary Guarantors to make payments on the subsidiary Guarantees and/or security.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding Section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) - now contained in
Section 15 lit. b) para 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (i.e., a situation where a managing director
makes a payment to the GmbH's shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the GmbH) or a so-called —
"destructive interference" (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited
liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its payment obligations towards its creditors) may be applied by
courts with respect to the enforcement of a subsidiary Guarantee (or granting and/or enforcement of security) granted by
the German subsidiary Guarantors. In such case, the amount of proceeds permitted or capable to be realized in an
enforcement process may be (further) reduced (up to zero). According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a
creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant
collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may
apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary Guarantees (or granting and/or enforcement of security) by
the German subsidiary Guarantors.


-----

Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the
subsidiary Guarantee (or granting and/or enforcement of security) or a creditor who provided additional, or extended
existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the
debtor's (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's (impending) insolvency at the time such
funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the
position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such_
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor
of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

The enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded,
according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche
_Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice_
(Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a Guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated
company within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) of such Guarantor (other
than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of
such Guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor's managing directors
pursuant to section 15b paras 4 and 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor
incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a general partner
(Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs
company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner
(Komplementär).

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain "accessory" security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee
and the creditor of the secured claim be identical. Such accessory security interests (i) cannot be held for the benefit of a
third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim, (ii) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured
claim is settled, discharged or novated and (iii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the
claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time
will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from
pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a
"parallel debt." Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any
amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the "Parallel Debt Obligation"). The
pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel
Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt
Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Notes and the Guarantees (the "Principal Obligations"), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a
claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions
confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel
debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the
pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral
through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under
German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other
creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral.
Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in
the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e.,
the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes must not be
excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in
case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security interest granted significantly and not only
temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an
initial excessive overcollateralization. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination
with other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is


-----

exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor
is entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied
in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (e.g. share
pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the German Federal High Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis, legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization
is given if the realization value of the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.

**Norway**

**_Insolvency_**

Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58
(Konkursloven) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), which sets forth the various procedures to be followed both in the case of courtadministered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings. Further, relevant rules are laid down in non-statutory law and
the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (Dekningsloven) (the "Recovery Act"), which contains general
provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims. A new debt restructuring procedure has temporarily replaced
(and, subject to forthcoming legislation, may in some form permanently replace) the court-administered debt negotiations
proceedings in the Bankruptcy Act – see "—Restructuring Proceedings" below.

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the
debtor's assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the
securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor's contractual relationships and (v) the
distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are
continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors
(holding or purporting to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its
debts as they become due (the "cash flow test"), and (ii) be in "deficit" (the company's debts must exceed the sum of its
assets, based on real, not book, values) (the "balance sheet test").

During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor's assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a
lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor's assets into cash in the
manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful
creditors pursuant to the applicable priority provisions.

All of the debtor's assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the
seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held
by third parties, if these assets have been acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner or the acquisition lacks legal
protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal
entity that is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets including, but not
limited to, the realization of assets.

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of
the secured assets is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. Any under-secured amount (any amount
exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed an ordinary (unsecured) claim. The secured creditors may, in
principle, realize the security, and cover the secured portion of their claims; however, the enforcement of a number of
categories of security during the first six months after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings will be subject to the approval
of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to restructuring proceedings). The bankruptcy estate has the right,
subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors
and others holding legal rights in the assets.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien, to cover its costs and expenses, over assets pledged
by the insolvent company. The statutory lien of the bankruptcy estate is limited to 5% of the estimated value or sales
proceeds of the encumbered assets, but limited to 700 times the applicable Norwegian court fee for each registered asset
(such court fee being currently NOK 1,243). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (security over cash
deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (Lov om
_finansiell sikkerhetsstillelse) (the "Financial Collateral Act"), cf. the Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 (Panteloven) (the_
"Liens Act") Section 6-4 (9).

In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the claims are provided with the following priority:


-----

(i) secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset – either after the
realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);

(ii) super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, the liquidator's costs and obligations
of the estate);

(iii) salary claims (within certain limitations);

(iv) tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);

(v) ordinary unsecured claims (all other unsubordinated claims, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and
indemnity claims); and

(vi) subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated
by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).

Creditors will obtain recovery from the surplus remaining after claims with better priority have been settled.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out
within certain periods (ranging from three to twelve months depending on the grounds for setting aside or reversing the
transaction and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy
proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt or perfected with
undue delay and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to
set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt,
favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to
cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

The financial distress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020 prompted the Norwegian
government to enact a new Temporary Debt Restructuring Act of May 7, 2020 No. 38 (Rekonstruksjonsloven) (the
"Restructuring Act"). The temporary debt restructuring procedure replaces the court-administered debt negotiations
proceedings mentioned above until 1 July 2025. On January 13, 2023, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security submitted
a legislative proposal for amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the Recovery Act and the Liens Act. The main purpose of
the proposal is to implement rules on restructuring to replace the rules on court-administered debt negotiations proceedings
in the Bankruptcy Act and the temporary rules in the Restructuring Act. The proposal has been subject to a consultation
period and is currently under consideration.

Under the Restructuring Act, debt restructuring proceedings are available to companies that are facing serious
economic difficulties in the near-term without necessarily being unable to pay their debts as they fall due. Furthermore,
any of the company's creditors may request debt restructuring proceedings if the company is unable to meet its obligations
as they fall due. The stay period during which security interests may generally not be enforced will last throughout the debt
restructuring period without any particular time limit. However, the debt restructuring period shall normally not exceed six
months, and the stay does not apply to security interests over monetary claims or any financial collateral arrangement in
accordance with the Financial Collateral Act.

Debt restructuring proceedings may result in either a voluntary settlement or a compulsory composition, which in
each case may consist of a payment extension, pro rata reduction of debt, conversion of debt to equity, liquidation of all
or parts of the debtor's assets or a combination of these measures, and/or in case of voluntary settlements, certain other
measures. The adoption of a voluntary settlement requires the consent of all creditors comprised by the proposed settlement,
while the adoption of a compulsory composition requires the consent of only 50% of the affected creditors (measured in
value, not the number of creditors), however so that a composition consisting of converting debt to equity would normally
need the consent of all relevant creditors (as well as consent from at least 50% of the company's shareholders).

Pursuant to the Restructuring Act, a company undergoing restructuring pursuant to the Restructuring Act may
raise financing for its operations during the restructuring phase (including for costs related to the restructuring). Such
financing and costs related to the restructuring itself will have a statutory lien over the assets of the company undergoing
restructuring and otherwise as set out in respect of statutory liens for bankruptcy estates – see "—Insolvency" above.
Furthermore, such financing and costs related to the restructuring itself may be granted a lien over machinery and plant
(driftstilbehør), inventory (varelager) and trade receivables (utestående fordringer) of the company with priority over all


-----

other liens or security interests in the relevant asset, regardless of whether such other liens or security interests have been
created voluntarily or involuntarily and the time at which such other liens or security have been created.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees_**

The granting of a Guarantee by the Norwegian subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain limitations under Norwegian law.
These limitations are set out in the following rules in Sections 8-7 and 8-10, c.f. Sections 1-3 and 1-4 of the Limited
Liability Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 44 (Aksjeloven) (the "Limited Liability Companies Act"):

(i) In order for a guarantee, loan or any security interest (jointly referred to as "Financial Assistance") provided by
the Norwegian Guarantor in connection with an acquisition of shares in the Norwegian Guarantor or its parent
company to be valid and binding, the financial exposure of the Norwegian Guarantor pursuant to such Financial
Assistance must not exceed the amounts that the Norwegian Guarantor has available for distribution of dividends
to its shareholders, and the Financial Assistance must be granted on ordinary, commercial terms. The limitation
of Financial Assistance to amounts that the Norwegian Guarantor has available for distribution of dividends does
not apply if the acquirer of the shares is based in the European Economic Area and the acquirer is, or will following
the acquisition, form part of the same group of companies as the Norwegian Guarantor. There is furthermore a
requirement that (A) the creditworthiness of the recipient of the Financial Assistance is evaluated by the board of
directors of the Norwegian Guarantor prior to the acquisition, (B) the Financial Assistance is approved by the
board of directors, and (C) the board of directors grants a declaration to the effect that it will be in the interests of
the company to grant the Financial Assistance and that the company will have sufficient equity and liquidity for
doing so and also give an account for the background and terms of such Financial Assistance. The Financial
Assistance must thereafter be approved by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital
represented at a shareholders' meeting of the Norwegian Guarantor and in accordance with a special procedure
where the information is filed with the Norwegian Business Registry before the Financial Assistance can be
granted.

(ii) Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (i) above, the Limited Liability Companies Act restricts generally
the ability of a Norwegian Guarantor to provide any Financial Assistance for the debt of shareholders or close
associates of the shareholders. The Norwegian Guarantor may however provide Financial Assistance for the debt
of a parent company or another company in the same group of companies as the Norwegian Guarantor, provided
that such Financial Assistance economically benefits at least one company within the group of companies of the
Norwegian Guarantor.

**_Solvent Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the relevant
enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without
the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral
Act and security over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically
included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principle require a final, legally binding
judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply
to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim against the assets of the guarantor.

**_Creation and Enforcement of Security_**

Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types (including
floating charges over certain asset types of a Norwegian company).

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement situation
and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead,
enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the relevant Norwegian enforcement authorities
following an event of default. However, the position is different for the enforcement of share pledges in a Norwegian
limited company: if the share pledge is in accordance with the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act, the parties are free
(within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share pledge agreement.

Furthermore, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or
directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade
receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding
amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor.


-----

The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In
practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it
is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the
secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for
enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor, the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the
identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. However, it has been
established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on
the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and
without having to disclose the entity of the bondholders.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Norwegian courts may award judgment in currencies other than NOK, but the debtor is nevertheless in relation to
such judgment entitled to make payment in NOK at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of such payment.

**Sweden**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated in Sweden. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to such Guarantors and
any other entities incorporated in Sweden (a "Swedish Party") including any and all of its respective assets (in Sweden and
abroad) will, as a starting point and by virtue of Article 7 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (as defined above), be governed
by Swedish insolvency law (lex concursus).

Under Swedish law, a debtor company may be subject to one of two types of insolvency proceedings, bankruptcy
pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (konkurslagen (1987:672)), as amended (the "Swedish Bankruptcy Act"), and
reorganization pursuant to the Swedish Company Reorganization Act (lag (2022:964) om företagsrekonstruktion), as
amended (the "Swedish Reorganization Act").

The insolvency laws of Sweden may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes and the
Guarantees. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Sweden applicable to Swedish
limited liability companies (aktiebolag), such as the Swedish Guarantors (which each is a Swedish limited liability
company).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act, if a company is unable to rightfully pay its debts as they fall due and
such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition
filed with the court by the debtor or by a creditor of the debtor.

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (konkursförvaltare) who is appointed by the competent court
will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor's assets and distributing the proceeds
amongst the creditors. The purpose of Swedish bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up a Swedish company in such a way
that the company's creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required
to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is considered best
for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to
distribute the proceeds in accordance with mandatory priority rules (see below under the heading "Priority of certain
creditors"). In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the assets of the company and its
directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to dispose of the company's assets or assume liabilities or
obligations which may be invoked in bankruptcy.

The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in
bankruptcy may, under certain circumstances, in its discretion, choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any
such existing contracts. A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of a bankruptcy may
be unenforceable.

**_Enforcement Process_**

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings and subject to the below, an enforcement process may
be initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Kronofogden) or a
court judgment. Upon obtaining an enforcement order or judgment against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish
Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. If (i) agreed between a pledgor and a secured creditor or a party acting
as agent on behalf of a secured creditor and (ii) the secured creditor or its agent is in physical possession of the security


-----

assets, the secured creditor or the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without having obtained an
enforcement order or court judgment. However, where a security holder seeks to enforce such security itself, certain
statutory notice requirements apply and the pledgee is under a fiduciary duty to protect the interest of the pledgor when
exercising its rights as a secured party or liquidating a secured asset. This duty includes, inter alia, an obligation to notify
the pledgor of any liquidation or sale of the collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to
the pledgor that portion of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. There are
provisions in the Swedish Contracts Act (Lag (1915:218) om avtal och andra rättshandlingar på förmögenhetsrättens
_område) which prohibit an enforcing party from foreclosing a secured asset by assuming ownership of the secured asset_
without accounting for the value thereof. Certain categories of properties may however only be enforced through the
Swedish Enforcement Authority.

Additionally, in respect of a pledge over shares, the secured creditor or its agent may subject to the conditions
above, carry out the enforcement and sell the shares through private or public sale or auction. Such process is however
subject to certain fiduciary duties and must be carried out in a manner that safeguards the interests of the pledgor. For
example the process should include a reasonable notice period before enforcement. There is no set time for such notice
period; instead it will depend on the circumstances at hand. Generally, the notice period should be sufficient to allow the
pledgor to participate in the sales process or prevent the enforcement by settling the secured obligations and sufficient for
potential buyers to be able to make an informed decision in the sales process so that they may place the best possible bid
for the shares. However, when determining what is a reasonable notice period, the interests of the secured creditors must
also be taken into consideration, where one aspect may be that a delay in enforcement might lead to deterioration of the
value of the security. In certain circumstances the fiduciary duty will also mean that the notice period needs to be shortened
in the interest of the pledgor to prevent such deterioration.

An enforcement in bankruptcy of security over, _inter alia, shares, can in principle be carried out in the same_
manner as outside bankruptcy (subject to certain statutory notice requirements and mandatory fiduciary duties). A creditor
having security over a specific object may demand that such object is sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue
delay, provided the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does
not, however, apply to property that is necessary for the continuation of the debtor company's business. The receiver in
bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either
incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a composition would become substantially more difficult, provided
that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured creditor.

Upon enforcement of security over shares, such shares may, subject to the conditions and certain fiduciary duties
as set out above, be sold by the secured creditor or its agent in an auction process. Such process will be subject to certain
statutory notice requirements which depend on whether or not the shares are deemed to be financial instruments. In respect
of shares which are not financial instruments, the shares may not, unless the receiver in bankruptcy consents otherwise, be
sold earlier than four weeks from the day of the court session where the directors testified on the veracity of the accounts
(edgångssammanträde) and the receiver in bankruptcy shall be given no less than three weeks prior notice of the auction
and be offered to acquire the shares at least one week prior to any enforcement action is taken. In respect of shares which
are financial instruments, the secured creditor may sell the shares without such notice periods, provided that the auction is
carried out in a commercially prudent manner and that in respect of shares in an unlisted subsidiary of the bankruptcy
debtor, after notifying the receiver in bankruptcy and giving the bankruptcy estate the opportunity to acquire the shares.

Under Swedish law, the value of the business mortgages issued by a company, which are subject to security in
favour of the noteholders, are dependent on the value of the assets held by that company at the time of the enforcement. It
shall be noted that, a business mortgage creates a security interest over all movable property (Sw. lös egendom) belonging
to the company and connected to the company's business, except for (i) cash and bank funds, (ii) shares and other financial
instruments intended for general trading, (iii) property that can be the subject to a security interest due to a mortgage, or
(iv) property that can neither be subject to a seizure (Sw. utmätning) nor included in a bankruptcy/insolvency liquidation.
The business mortgage gives the creditors a right to succession to 100 per cent of the value of the company's movable
assets (with the exceptions set out above), up to an amount equal to the lower of (i) the secured claim, or (ii) 115 per cent
of the face amount of the business mortgage certificates, plus interest on such amount from the date of enforcement at a
rate corresponding to the official reference rate plus four per cent, provided that claims with higher priority (e.g. which are
subject to pledges) have been satisfied. Business mortgages are enforced in accordance with the stipulations of the Swedish
Act on Enforcement (1981:774) (Sw. _Utsökningsbalken) and can only be enforced through the Swedish Enforcement_
Authority or, in case of bankruptcy, by the bankruptcy administrator.

**_Priority of certain creditors_**

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)) (the "Swedish Rights of Priority Act"), which states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to
payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor's assets. However, some preferential and secured


-----

creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before other
creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: "Specific preferential rights" and "General preferential rights."
"Specific preferential rights" apply to certain specific property and give a creditor a right to payment from such property.
"General preferential rights" cover all property belonging to the insolvent company's estate in bankruptcy, which is not
covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Such preferential and
secured creditors may also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement
Act (utsökningsbalken (1981:774)), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets (handpanträtt),
enforcement through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act. Claims that do
not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the
extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are generally of equal standing as against each other.

**_Challengeable transactions_**

In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are met, company reorganization proceedings, transactions can
(in certain circumstances and subject to different time limits) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to
the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others,
situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of one or
more of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest,
granted a guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected
without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is
considerable compared to the value of the debtor's assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In
the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the three or six
month periods preceding the commencement of the relevant Swedish insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer
time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an
agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or parent company
and situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement are aware of, inter alia, the insolvency of the
debtor.

**_Limitations on enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Swedish Reorganization Act (lag (2022:964) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulty in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these without being declared bankrupt. A
corporate reorganization shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain
conditions be extended by additional three month periods for up to 15 months in total from the commencement of the
reorganization.

An administrator (rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards
the interests of creditors of the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for
important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to order of reorganization, granting security for a debt
that arose prior to order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a
substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required.

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor and
provisions which have the effect that one party may terminate, withhold performance, or otherwise change an agreement
or the application of an agreement to the detriment of a counterparty as a result of an application for company reorganization
or the opening of company reorganization proceedings with respect to that counterparty will not be valid and enforceable.
During the corporate reorganization, the debtor's business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However,
the corporate reorganization includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due
prior to the order without the consent of the administrator, and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be
stayed. Furthermore, the right to enforce security provided by a counterparty subject to Swedish company reorganization
proceedings is restricted during such proceedings. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or
enforcement of security during a corporate reorganization through the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Kronofogden).

Any new debt extended to the debtor during the reorganization proceedings may be entitled to so called super
priority and thus constituting a preferred claim.

During reorganization proceedings, the debtor may apply to the court requesting a plan negotiation
(planförhandling) presenting the court with a restructuring plan to be proposed to the creditors, which means that the
amount of a creditor's claim may be reduced. All stakeholders affected by the restructuring plan may participate and are
divided into groups reflecting the rights and seniority of their claims and interests, and under certain circumstances cramdowns may be executed that will affect both secured and unsecured creditors. The proposed restructuring plan must meet
certain requirements to be accepted such as that a sufficient proportion of the affected creditors which are allowed to vote,
in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims, vote in favor of such restructuring plan. A plan meeting


-----

(plansammanträde) is convened to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. A restructuring plan determined by the courts
of Sweden is a valid and binding choice of law as between the debtor and the affected parties (obligationsrättsligt).

**_Liquidation due to Capital Deficiency_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) whenever a company's board of directors
has reason to assume that the company's equity is less than half of the registered share capital, the company's board of
directors shall prepare a balance sheet for liquidation purposes (kontrollbalansräkning) and, if applicable, have it reviewed
by the company's auditors. The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4
of the Swedish Enforcement Code (utsökningsbalk (1981:774)) is determined to not have sufficient seizeable assets.

If the balance sheet for liquidation purposes shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the registered
share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, give notice of a general meeting at which it shall be considered
whether the company shall be liquidated (the "first control general meeting"). If the control balance sheet presented at the
first control general meeting does not show that the equity of the company amounts to, at least, the registered share capital
and the first control general meeting has not resolved to liquidate the company, the question of whether the company shall
be liquidated must be reconsidered at a second control general meeting within eight months of the first control general
meeting. Prior to the second control general meeting a new balance sheet for liquidation purposes must be prepared and
reviewed by the company's auditors (if applicable).

A shareholders' resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator (likvidator). Should the shareholders not resolve on a
voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders' meeting is not held within the period of
time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders' meeting was not
reviewed by the company's auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts
to at least the registered share capital) the court shall put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator.
The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the company's assets and settle the
company's debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company's unknown creditors and creditors that
have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to
their claims.

**_Limitations on the validity and value of a guarantee or security interest_**

If a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving sufficient
corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, according to the Swedish Companies Act
(aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) (the "Swedish Companies Act"), in whole or in part, constitute a transfer of value from a
Swedish limited liability company (a "Swedish Company") which would be unlawful if: (i) the Swedish Company would
lack cover for its restricted equity capital after such value transfer or (ii) it would not be considered prudent by the Swedish
Company to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the
nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish Company's business or the Swedish Company's need to strengthen its balance
sheet, liquidity or financial position.

This could be the case if, at the time the guarantee or security interest for the obligations of a third party is provided
by a Swedish Company, such third party is deemed unable to fulfil its obligation to indemnify the Swedish Company if the
guarantee is utilized or if the security is enforced. Further, this could also be the case if a Swedish Company provides any
security interest or guarantee in respect of debt owed by a non wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish Company without
the Swedish Company receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return.

The Guarantee provided by any Swedish Company is limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to
corporate benefit and contains, or will contain, limitation language limiting the liability of the relevant Swedish Company
thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to unlawful value transfers.

The Swedish Companies Act also prohibits any Swedish Company from providing guarantees or security interests
for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in a Swedish Company or the shares in any of their respective
parent companies incorporated in Sweden. Moreover, based on legislative history it is often argued that the prohibition also
applies when a Swedish Company provides a guarantee or a security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the
acquisition of a subsidiary of any of its parent companies incorporated in Sweden not being a subsidiary of the relevant
Swedish Company. Additionally, no Swedish Company may provide a guarantee or any security interest for the obligations
of a parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to which any Swedish Company and such parent or
sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA.


-----

**_Creation of valid security interests_**

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the property subject to such security interest must
fulfil the following criteria: (i) there must be an underlying debtor creditor relationship in respect of the obligations which
the security purports to secure; (ii) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement;
and (iii) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset
type.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured
party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control,
deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under
Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely
operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an acceleration event would therefore not
be effective until an acceleration event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Such unperfected
security interests are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any
Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of
its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security
interest over an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at
risk of impairing the validity of the security.

**_Security granted in favor of the secured parties represented by an agent_**

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of the secured parties represented by
an agent. However, it is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney
or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of
attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy
or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. The concept of trust does not exist under Swedish law and unless the
trustee is treated as the agent of the secured parties, the security will be invalid should Swedish law be deemed applicable.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Rule 144A Global Notes"). The Notes sold
to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and together with the Rule 144A
Global Notes, the "Global Notes"). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the "Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests") and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests" and together with the Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and
their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant's account with the interest beneficially
owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may
impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners
of interest in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the
Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or "holder" of the Notes under the Indenture for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depository for Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable
(or its nominees) will be considered the holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures
of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, and their respective agents, nor the Trustee
under the Indenture nor any of the Issuer's or the Trustee's respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for
any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the "Definitive Registered Notes") only if:

(a) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(b) Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(c) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in
the immediately preceding clause (c), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued Notes in
definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of holders and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the
beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as
provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption


-----

of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part
transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that, a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the
Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by
the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Issuer's and the Trustee's requirements are
met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Issuer and the Trustee to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may
suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered
Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with
the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such
Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and
no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to
the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will
distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests
in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that
no Book-Entry Interest of less €100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional
interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such
payments to the common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and
any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the


-----

records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in "street name."

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other
person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with any such payment. Holders of Notes may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have
economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery
of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with
the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in "Notice to Investors." Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in "Notice to Investors."

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule
144A Global Note, as set forth in "Notice to Investors."

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if
available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions set forth in "Notice to
_Investors" and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global
Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.


-----

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in "Notice to Investors," Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under "Description of the Notes—Transfer." Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes
that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same
denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a
Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a
Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under "Description of the Notes—Transfer" and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee,
the Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See "Notice to Investors."

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be
changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the
accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear
and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities
that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may
be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons
take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
person may be limited.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers
of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or
continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer,
the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent, nor any of their
respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any


-----

Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made
on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their
interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the
transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear
is used.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences,_
_under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the_
_consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on, and sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

**Certain Dutch Tax Considerations**

The following summary outlines certain principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption
and disposal of the Notes, but does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Dutch tax considerations that may
be relevant. For purposes of Dutch tax law, a holder of Notes may include an individual or entity who does not have the
legal title of these Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes or the income thereof is attributed based on specific statutory
provisions or on the basis of such individual or entity having an interest in the Notes or the income thereof. This summary
is intended as general information only and each prospective investor should consult a professional tax adviser with respect
to the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption and disposal of the Notes.

This summary is based on tax legislation, published case law, treaties, regulations and published policy, in each
case as in force as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and it does not take into account any developments or
amendments thereof after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have retroactive effect.

This summary does not address the Dutch corporate and individual income tax consequences for:

(i) investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen);

(ii) pension funds, exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) or other entities that
are not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax;

(iii) holders of Notes holding a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or deemed substantial interest
(fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer and holders of Notes of whom a certain related person holds a
substantial interest in the Issuer. Generally speaking, a substantial interest in the Issuer arises if a person,
alone or, where such person is an individual, together with his or her partner (statutorily defined term),
directly or indirectly, holds or is deemed to hold (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued capital
of the Issuer or 5% or more of the issued capital of a certain class of shares of the Issuer, (ii) rights to
acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest or (iii) certain profit-sharing rights in the Issuer;

(iv) persons to whom the Notes and the income therefrom are attributed based on the separated private assets
(afgezonderd particulier vermogen) provisions of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet
_inkomstenbelasting 2001);_

(v) entities which are a resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and that have an enterprise which is
carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius
or Saba and the Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; and

(vi) individuals to whom the Notes or the income there from are attributable to employment activities which
are taxed as employment income in the Netherlands.

Where this summary refers to 'the Netherlands' or 'Dutch', such reference is restricted to the part of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands that is situated in Europe and the legislation applicable in that part of the Kingdom.

This summary does not describe the consequences of the exchange or conversion of the Notes.

**_Dutch Withholding Tax_**

All payments made by the Issuer under the Notes may - except in certain very specific cases as described below be made free of withholding or deduction for any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the
Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein provided that the Notes do not in fact function
as equity of the Issuer within the meaning of article 10, paragraph 1, under d of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969
(Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969).

Dutch withholding tax may apply on certain (deemed) interest due and payable to an affiliated (gelieerde) entity
of the Issuer if such entity (i) is considered to be resident (gevestigd) in a jurisdiction that is listed in the yearly updated
Dutch Regulation on low-taxing states and non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (Regeling laagbelastende staten
_en niet-coöperatieve rechtsgebieden voor belastingdoeleinden), or (ii) has a permanent establishment located in such_


-----

jurisdiction to which the interest is attributable, or (iii) is entitled to the interest payable for the main purpose or one of the
main purposes to avoid taxation of another person, or (iv) is not considered to be the recipient of the interest in its
jurisdiction of residence because such jurisdiction treats another (lower-tier) entity as the recipient of the interest (hybrid
mismatch), or (v) is not treated as resident anywhere (also a hybrid mismatch), or (vi) is a reverse hybrid whereby the
jurisdiction of residence of a higher-tier beneficial owner (achterliggende gerechtigde) that has a qualifying interest
(kwalificerend belang) in the reverse hybrid treats the reverse hybrid as tax transparent and that higher-tier beneficial owner
would have been taxable based on one (or more) of the items in (i)-(v) above had the interest been due to him directly, all
within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021).

**_Corporate and Individual Income Tax_**

_Residents of the Netherlands_

If a holder of Notes is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch
corporate income tax purposes and is fully subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is only subject to Dutch corporate
income tax in respect of an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable, income derived from the Notes and gains realized
upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes are generally taxable in the Netherlands (at up to a maximum rate of 25.8%).

If an individual is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch individual
income tax purposes, income derived from the Notes and gains realized upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes are
taxable at the progressive rates (at up to a maximum rate of 49.5%) under the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001, if:

(a) the individual is an entrepreneur (ondernemer) and has an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable
or the individual has, other than as a shareholder, a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise
(medegerechtigde), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or

(b) such income or gains qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige
_werkzaamheden), which includes activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio_
management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer).

If neither condition (a) nor condition (b) above applies to the holder of the Notes, taxable income with regard to
the Notes must be determined on the basis of a deemed return on savings and investments (sparen en beleggen), rather than
on the basis of income actually received or gains actually realized. This deemed return on savings and investments is
determined based on the individual's yield basis (rendementsgrondslag) at the beginning of the calendar year (1 January),
insofar as the individual's yield basis exceeds a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen) (€57,000 in 2023). The
individual's yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets held by the individual less the fair
market value of certain qualifying liabilities on 1 January. The individual's deemed return is calculated by multiplying the
individual's yield basis with a 'deemed return percentage' (effectief rendementspercentage), which percentage depends on
the actual composition of the yield basis, with separate deemed return percentages for savings (banktegoeden), other
investments (overige bezittingen) and debts (schulden). As of January 1, 2023, the percentage for other investments, which
include the Notes, is set at 6.17%. The deemed return on savings and investments is taxed at a rate of 32%.

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

If a person is neither a resident of the Netherlands nor is deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch
corporate or individual income tax purposes, such person is not liable to Dutch income tax in respect of income derived
from the Notes and gains realized upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes, unless:

(a) the person is not an individual and such person (1) has an enterprise that is, in whole or in part, carried
on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands to which
permanent establishment or a permanent representative the Notes are attributable, or (2) is, other than by
way of securities, entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of
an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are
attributable.

This income is subject to Dutch corporate income tax at up to a maximum rate of 25.8%.

(b) the person is an individual and such individual (1) has an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is,
in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the
Netherlands to which permanent establishment or permanent representative the Notes are attributable, or
(2) realizes income or gains with respect to the Notes that qualify as income from miscellaneous activities
in the Netherlands which include activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio


-----

management, or (3) is, other than by way of securities, entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise
that is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are attributable.

Income derived from the Notes as specified under (1) and (2) by an individual is subject to individual
income tax at progressive rates up to a maximum rate of 49.5%. Income derived from a share in the
profits of an enterprise as specified under (3) that is not already included under (1) or (2) will be taxed
on the basis of a deemed return on savings and investments (as described above under "—Residents of
_the Netherlands")._

**_Gift and Inheritance Tax_**

Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the occasion of the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on
the death of, a holder of Notes, unless:

(vii) the holder of the Notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions; or

(viii) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or gift made by, or on behalf of, a person who, at the time of
the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions.

**_Value Added Tax_**

In general, no value added tax will arise in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in
respect of a cash payments made under the Notes, or in respect of a transfer of the Notes.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No registration tax, customs duty, transfer tax, stamp duty, capital tax or any other similar documentary tax or
duty will be payable in the Netherlands by a holder in respect of or in connection with the subscription, issue, placement,
allotment, delivery or transfer of the Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The discussion below is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership
and disposition of Notes. The following summary addresses only U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined
herein) who purchase the Notes for cash at the "issue price" (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold
for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and hold the Notes as
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of
its source or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons has the
authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has made a valid election in effect under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations ("Treasury Regulations") to be treated as a U.S. person. A "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial
owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as
of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal income
tax consequences different from those summarized below. The discussion below does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the
acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including the impact of the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax or any alternative minimum tax), nor does it address any tax consequences arising under U.S.
federal estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. In addition, this
summary does not address tax consequences to U.S. Holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as banks,
dealers, traders that elect to mark to market, insurance companies, financial institutions, regulated investment companies,
real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, persons holding the Notes as part of a
hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated financial transaction, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders that are required to take certain amounts into income no later than the time
such amounts are reflected on an applicable financial statement, holders that are lenders under the Existing Term Loan B
or the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, or U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar. If an entity


-----

treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of an entity or arrangement that is
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is considering holding the Notes is urged to consult
its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to it and its partners of the acquisition, ownership
and disposition of the Notes by the partnership.

The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences set out below is for general information only. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of
owning the Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to
changes in tax law.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances the Issuer may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated interest
and principal, including as described in "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption," "Description of the Notes—
_Guarantees—Additional Amounts"_ and "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control." The Issuer
intends to take the position the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments ("CPDIs") for U.S.
federal income tax purposes because of these additional payments. The Issuer's position is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless
the U.S. Holder discloses in the proper manner to the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") that it is taking a different
position. Assuming such position is respected, U.S. Holders would be required to include in income the amount of any
such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with their method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as CPDIs,
U.S. Holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Notes and to
treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or redemption of the Notes.
Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the
CPDI rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

_Euro-Denominated Stated Interest_

Each payment of "qualified stated interest" (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in
respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. The term "qualified stated interest" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least
annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified
stated interest.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest
denominated in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment based on the "spot rate" (as such term is defined
in Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A
cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize
exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under "—Disposition of Euros").

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated
interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income
accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an
accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the
second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot
rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on
the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually
paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may
instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt. Any such
election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder who receives a stated interest payment denominated in euros (including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize
U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received
(translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value
of the amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated,


-----

for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

_Foreign Tax Credit_

Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid
in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be considered income from sources
outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category
income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on
a U.S. Holder's ability to claim foreign tax credits. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the
applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount ("OID") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event,
U.S. Holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of
cash attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price
(as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied
by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes
with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when
principal payments are made on the Note.

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the
sum of the "daily portions" of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which
such U.S. Holder holds such Note ("accrued OID"). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any "accrual
period" a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The "accrual period" of a Note may be of any length and
may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each
scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID
that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note's "adjusted issue price" at the
beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each
accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable
to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price,
increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars
in accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under
"—Payments of Stated Interest—Euro-Denominated Stated Interest." OID generally will be income from sources outside
the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income.

A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the
receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference,
if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such
payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Exchange
gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Disposition of Notes_**

On a sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid
stated interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income as described above to the extent not previously included in
income by a U.S. Holder) and (ii) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Note, in each case as determined in U.S.
dollars. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such taxable disposition, the amount realized by a U.S. Holder will
be the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of the disposition (or based
on the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market and
taxably disposed of by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). An accrual basis U.S. Holder
that does not make the election referred to in the prior sentence will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there


-----

are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the "U.S. dollar cost" (as defined herein) of the
Note to such holder increased by any previously accrued OID. The "U.S. dollar cost" of a Note purchased with foreign
currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of
purchase (or based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an
established securities market that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder).

If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described in the two previous paragraphs, such election must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations,
any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S.
Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject
to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the Notes.

The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations
in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.-source for U.S.
foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the
U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and
(ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and
unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any which will be treated as discussed above under "—Payments of Stated
_Interest" or "—Original Issue Discount," as applicable. However, a U.S. Holder will only realize exchange gain or loss_
upon the disposition of a Note (including any exchange gain or loss attributable to the principal amount of a Note and any
exchange gain or loss attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID) to the extent of the total gain or
loss realized by such holder on the disposition. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
proper calculation of exchange gain or loss realized in connection with their acquisition and disposition of the Notes.

**_Disposition of Euros_**

Euros received as interest on a Note or upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally
will have a tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time they are received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the euros (including their use to purchase Notes or upon their exchange for U.S.
dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under "Description of the Notes." These Additional Notes,
even if they are treated for non tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes in some cases may be treated
as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have a
greater amount of OID, which may adversely affect the market value of the original Notes if the Additional Notes are not
otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Modification of the Notes following an IPO_**

Upon certain circumstances, the issuer of the Notes may be modified as described in "Description of the Notes—
_IPO Pushdown." Depending on the facts and circumstances at the time of such event, such modification may change the_
obligor of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes thereby resulting in a deemed exchange of the outstanding Notes,
which may be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
modification of a debt instrument is treated as a "deemed exchange" of an old debt instrument for a new debt instrument
upon which gain or loss is realized only if such modification is "significant" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations.
A change in obligor of the Notes following an IPO Event may be treated as a significant modification depending on the
facts and circumstances at the time of such event. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of such an event.


-----

**_Foreign Asset Disclosure_**

Individuals (which may include certain entities treated as individuals for the purposes of these rules) that own
"specified foreign financial assets" with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more
than $75,000 at any time during the tax year (or such larger values as specified in the relevant rules) generally are required
to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified
foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest, and a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a
foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion below under "—Back-Up Withholding and Information Reporting," a Non-U.S. Holder
generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes and gain from the
sale, retirement or other disposition of the Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the
conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States and (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the
sale or exchange of a Note by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met.

**_Back-Up Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements may apply to all payments of principal and interest (including the
accrual of OID, if any) on, or the proceeds from a sale of, a Note, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, such as a
corporation. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), (ii) furnishes an
incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it failed to properly report certain interest or dividends, or (iv) fails, under
certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is a U.S. person, that the TIN
provided is correct, and that it has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding, it may be subject
to back-up withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). In general, payments of principal, interest and accrued OID on, and
the proceeds of a sale, retirement or other disposition of, the Notes, payable to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent
or other U.S. intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements if
appropriate certification (IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the payor
and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.

Back-up withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the back-up withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes (or_
_any interest therein) by (i) any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income_
_Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), that is subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA,_
_(ii) any "plan" as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), such_
_as individual retirement accounts or arrangements subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) any entity whose underlying_
_assets include "plan assets" by reason of any such employee benefit plan's or plan's investment in the entity (each of the_
_foregoing, a "Plan"), and (iv) a governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plan (as defined_
_in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plan (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that, while not subject to Title I_
_of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or_
_regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975_
_of the Code ("Similar Laws") (any such governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, a "Similar Law Plan"). This summary is_
_general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be_
_imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other_
_persons considering purchasing the Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan or any_
_Similar Law Plan, consult with their own counsel to determine whether such acquisition will violate Title I of ERISA,_
_Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Laws._

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of a Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, to
a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan or any Similar Law Plan, a fiduciary
should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan or the
Similar Law Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary's duties
to the Plan or the Similar Law Plan including, without limitation, the investment prudence, diversification, delegation of
control, fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar
Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are "parties in interest," within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA,
or "disqualified persons," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption
or exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Initial Purchasers or any of their
respective affiliates (the "Transaction Parties") are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute
or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless
the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or exception.
In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the "DOL") has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions ("PTCEs")
that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 91-38
(relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an
"independent qualified professional asset manager"), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company
general account), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan; provided
that, neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary
authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction and
provided further that the Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be
no assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other exemption or exception will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception is available, it will cover
all aspects of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited
transaction rules and these exemptions.


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired, held or disposed of by, or on
behalf of, any Plan or any Similar Law Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition would not constitute or result
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any
Similar Laws.

**Representations**

Accordingly, each purchaser and transferee of the Notes or any interest therein will be deemed to represent,
warrant and covenant, for so long as it holds such Note or any interest therein, that (1) either (A) it is not, is not acting on
behalf of, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire or hold such Note or any interest therein constitutes
the assets of, a Plan or a Similar Law Plan, or (B)(i) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or any interest
therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws, and (ii) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment
recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Plan ("Plan
**Fiduciary"), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in such Note, and they are not otherwise**
undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, to the Plan or the Plan
Fiduciary in connection with the Plan's acquisition of the Notes, and the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent
judgement in evaluating the investment in such Note, and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Note or any interest
therein other than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the Indenture, certified) to make these same
representations, warranties and covenants with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or any
interest therein.

The sale of any Notes to a Plan or a Similar Law Plan is in no respect a representation by the Transaction Parties
that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or Similar Law Plans
generally or any particular Plan or Similar Law Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans or Similar Law
Plans generally or any particular Plan or Similar Law Plan.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the
Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Guarantees (collectively, the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only in the United States, to QIBs in reliance on Rule
144A and outside the United States, in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered, and will not, register the Securities under the U.S. Securities Act and, therefore, the
Securities may not be offered or sold within the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the
Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only: (i) in the United States, to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A
and (ii) outside the United States, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms "offshore transaction" and "United States" with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes (other than each of the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and that the Securities
are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities
laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or other
jurisdiction, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) You are not our "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) or acting on our behalf and you
are either: (i) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A, and are aware that any sale of these Securities to you will
be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another
QIB, or (ii) purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

(3) You acknowledge that none of us or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any of them or their
affiliates, has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of the Securities, other
than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered
to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the Securities. You
acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have
had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as you have deemed necessary
in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of,
and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing the Securities for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which you are
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable securities laws of any state
of the United States or other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your
or their ability to resell such Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account or accounts for which you are purchasing
the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to agree, to
offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Securities or any beneficial interests in such Securities prior to the date (the
"Resale Restriction Termination Date") that is, in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the later of
the original issue date of such Securities, the original issue date of any Additional Notes and the last date on which
the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto), only (i) to us,
(ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so


-----

long as the Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB
that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore
transactions in compliance with Regulation S, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of
law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
your or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws
and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer's and the Trustee's rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer
(I) pursuant to clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other
information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of
transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the Note is completed and delivered by the transferor to the
Trustee, Registrar or Transfer Agent (as applicable). The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent
to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "U.S. SECURITIES ACT"), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE

ARE NOT OTHERWISE UNDERTAKING TO ACT AS A FIDUCIARY, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(21)
OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE, TO THE PLAN OR THE PLAN FIDUCIARY IN

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of
beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(8) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions on the
transfer of such Notes.

(9) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes within
the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

(10) You acknowledge that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer
any Notes acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agree that if any of the acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by your purchase of the Notes is no longer

agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent that you have sole investment discretion with respect to
each such investor account and that you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

(12) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the possession, circulation or distribution of
this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action


-----

for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions
set forth under "Plan of Distribution." And you will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any
subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it of the selling restrictions set forth under "Plan of Distribution."

(13) You represent that you are not a "retail investor" in the EEA. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression

(15) You understand and acknowledge that:

(i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to, any "retail investor" in the EEA (as defined in paragraph (13) above)
or any "retail investor" in the United Kingdom (as defined in paragraph (14) above);

(ii) no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation in the EEA for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA (as defined in paragraph (13)
above) has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation; and

(iii) no key information document required by the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation in the United Kingdom or for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom
(as defined in paragraph (14) above) has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under
the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

(16) You represent that you are a "relevant person," where "relevant persons" are persons who are: (i) persons who

acting on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein
constitutes the assets of, (i) a Plan or (ii) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to Similar Laws
or (B) the acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of
any Similar Law and (2) you will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than
to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations and warranties with respect to its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein.

(18) If you are a Plan, you will be further deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (A) none of the Transaction
Parties (as defined above) has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which you, or

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement dated as of     , 2023 among the Issuer,
the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the "Purchase Agreement"), the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer the entire principal
amount of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase all of the Notes sold
under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are purchased.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the
initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the
Initial Purchasers without notice. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering
shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on
the cover page hereof.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers
may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period
from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date hereof, the Issuer will not, and the
Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are
substantially similar to the Notes.

**Securities Not Being Registered Under the U.S. Securities Act**

The Securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of
any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and may only be offered or sold (i) in the United States, to QIBs in
reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Resales
of the Securities are restricted as described under "Notice to Investors."

**United Kingdom**

Each Initial Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available, and
will not offer, sell or otherwise make available, any Notes to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes
of this provision the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of U.K. MiFIR.


-----

**EEA**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available, and
will not offer, sell or otherwise make available, any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this
provision the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**Other Jurisdictions**

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the
Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this
Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is
required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum
nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from
any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes
in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

**Resale Restriction**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract
or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule
144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, the Issuer cannot guarantee
that its application for listing on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or permission to deal in the Notes will
be granted as of the settlement date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, or that such listing will be maintained, and
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such
market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes,_
_in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited."_

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be      business days (as such term is used for purposes of
Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to
as "T +      "). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days (until the end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle of T+1 on May 28, 2024), unless
the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date
of this Offering Memorandum or the following      business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement
cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.


-----

**Stabilization**

In connection with the Offering, BNP Paribas (the "Stabilizing Manager"), or persons acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the
Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as
to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our
_Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited."_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which
creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying
security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the
Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial
Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer
are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which
adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may currently and/or in the future
perform, various financial advisory, investment and corporate banking, commercial lending and banking, hedging,
consulting and other commercial services in the ordinary course of business for us and our affiliates, and may have from
time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates' securities or enter into
hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they
received or will receive customary fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such
investment and U.S. securities activities may involve our or our affiliates' securities and/or instruments (directly, as
collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
instruments and at any time may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Senior
Facilities and thus, may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering upon repayment thereof.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain of those
Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may routinely hedge, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are likely to
hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to our or our affiliates in a
manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our or our affiliates' securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit
default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in the Netherlands. Other Guarantors are_
_organized under the laws of Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and future_
_Guarantors and security providers may also be organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. All of our directors and_
_executive officers and all of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although_
_we and each of the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action_
_under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and_
_executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors. In addition, as all of our and the Guarantors'_
_assets and the assets of our and their directors and executive officers are located outside the United States, you may be_
_unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the_
_federal or state securities laws of the United States, and there is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales of_
_civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for_
_enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the_
_Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United_
_States._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such judgment_
_in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the_
_United States is described below for the countries in which our Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own_
_advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United_
_States._

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (the "Dutch Guarantors") are incorporated under Dutch law and have
their registered seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States
may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in
U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment
for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not
be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must
be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same
judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over
the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted
principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the
foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier
judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties,
provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is—according to the
law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy
could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a
competent judicial body.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal
or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful
whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the
Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be
subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed
in euro at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of
the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay
proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the
extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S.
courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van
_Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering)._


-----

**Austria**

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign judgments are only enforceable if
reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by an ordinance (Verordnung)
of the Austrian government (in which ordinance the Austrian government confirms the reciprocity). The Republic of
Austria and the United States have not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments rendered in either state's courts, other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters. There is also no
applicable ordinance of the Austrian government in place. As such, the courts of Austria will not recognize and/or enforce
a judgment obtained in the courts of the United States being a judgment rendered by a United States federal or state court.
Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court must be
re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian civil procedure laws (Zivilprozessverfahren).
Only after having obtained a final judgment before Austrian courts can enforcement procedures be initiated under the
Austrian Enforcement Act.

**Belgium**

In the absence of any applicable bilateral or multilateral treaty between the United States and Belgium on the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, a final and enforceable judgment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States will not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Belgium.

In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Belgium, formal exequatur proceedings must first be initiated before
a court of competent jurisdiction in Belgium according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 et. seq. of the Belgian Code
of Private International Law of July 16, 2004 (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé),
and provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law, the following documents are
produced in court by the claimant seeking enforcement:

     - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

     - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating
process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent
document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating that the judgment was served or
notified to the party that did not appear; and

     - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has
been notified to the defendant.

In such an action, Belgian procedural rules will apply and the Belgian court would not generally reinvestigate the merits
of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is set out below).

However, the court will refuse recognition and enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian
Code of International Private Law, if, among other things:

     - the rights of defense have not been observed;

     - the recognition or enforcement in Belgium would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy
(such incompatibility being assessed by taking into account, inter alia, the intensity of the connection of
the situation with the Belgian legal order and the gravity of the effect produced);

     - the decision is not final and may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law; it is debated whether
a foreign judgment which has been declared provisionally enforceable in the State of origin may, despite
being appealable in that State, be enforced in Belgium under Article 23, §4 of the Belgian Code of Private
International Law;

     - the judgment was obtained for the sole purpose of avoiding the application of the law which would have
been designated on the basis of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (if Belgian courts had
ruled on the case), and in a matter in which parties may not deviate from mandatory rules under such
applicable law;

     - the claim was filed in the foreign courts after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between
the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;


-----

     - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another
jurisdiction that is susceptible of being recognized in Belgium;

     - Belgian courts had exclusive jurisdictions in respect of that matter;

     - the competence of the foreign courts was solely based on the presence in the foreign state of the defendant
or of assets with no direct connection with the dispute; or

     - the decision is in conflict with Belgian rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in
relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Belgium judgments in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

Note that the Belgian Code of Private International Law contains specific rules for the enforcement of judgements
that relate to insolvency matters and that foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the
merits of the judgment. As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex
fori). In Belgium the procedural rules contained in, amongst others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of
Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by U.S. courts is sought in
Belgium.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or
enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must
first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English court would
not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below)
and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it
and no other compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at a trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and establishing a debt or being for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, statute or the Human Rights Act 1998;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a law that an English court
considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law;

    - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice;

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court or another court whose judgment
is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court in
respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and

    - the English recognition proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be
enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English
judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the


-----

judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated
against the judgment or against the foreign judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to recognize and enforce in England judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that this is
the case. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the
original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws.

**Finland**

As there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not automatically recognize
and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court
judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a
judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence
of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute.

In respect of judgments rendered by an English court in a matter where parties have stipulated an exclusive choice
of court agreement in their contracts, the final judgment is, as a principal rule, recognized and enforceable in Finland under
the Hague Convention in accordance with its provisions. Where the choice of law provision is non-exclusive or exclusive
in favour of one counterparty only, a judgment rendered by an English court is as such not enforceable in Finland but a
Finnish title for execution (i.e. a Finnish court judgment) is required for such enforcement. In seeking a Finnish court
judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of an English court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of
fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute.

The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not
being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered
applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome
contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as proven
by the claimant. Contractual penalties (regardless of proof of actual damage) are, however, as a general rule enforceable.
A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies with the
claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the
evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of
documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not
recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very
limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually
only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium
as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce
a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do
not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in
civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United
States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable,
either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and
enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by
the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and
enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

    - the judgment being final under U.S. law;

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding in accordance with the principles of
jurisdictional competence according German law;


-----

    - whether the defendant who did not appear in the proceedings and who objects to this fact, was duly and
timely informed of the proceedings, enabling him to present his defense;

    - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a judgment of a
foreign court recognized by the German court and – in each case handed down before the judgment of
the U.S. court;

    - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the procedure of a matter pending before a German
court, provided that such matter was pending before a German court before the U.S. court entered its
judgment;

    - the effects of recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with German public policy,
including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

    - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity of enforcement of judgments.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in
Germany will be successful.

It is doubtful whether a German court would impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Germany
based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court,
and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also
certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S.
federal and state law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German
public policy.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally.

German courts also usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or any other damages
which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, as incompatible with the substantive foundations of
German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages
only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the
production of evidence is concerned, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production
of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive
in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as
evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute
and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**Norway**

Norwegian courts will, as a general rule, not recognize or enforce judgments rendered by a foreign court unless
Norway has entered into a bilateral or multilateral treaty with the relevant country or countries regarding the recognition
and enforcement of judgments and subject to the provisions of section 19-16 of the Norwegian Dispute Act of June 17,
2005 No. 90 (Tvisteloven) (the "Dispute Act"). Due to the Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil
and Commercial Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), Norwegian courts will recognize as a valid judgment, and enforce,
any final civil judgment obtained in a foreign court in a state which is a party to the Lugano Convention, without a further
reexamination of the merits of the case. The exceptions stated in the Lugano Convention itself will apply. The United States
is not a party to the Lugano Convention. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there is no such treaty between the
United States and Norway in place.

If there is no treaty between Norway and the relevant jurisdiction regarding the recognition and enforcement of
judgments, or the relevant treaty is not applicable, a judgment rendered by a foreign court (e.g. the U.S. courts) may


-----

nevertheless be recognized and enforced in Norway without reexamination of the merits of the case if the foreign
proceedings and the judgment itself fulfill the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement Act of June 26, 1992 No.
86 (Tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven) and the Dispute Act. Such conditions include, without limitation, that:

    - the respective parties thereto have submitted the matter in dispute in writing to a court or tribunal in the
agreed jurisdiction;

    - there is no other mandatory venue for such dispute;

    - such judgment obtained is final and enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the country where it was
issued; and

    - the acceptance and enforcement of the judgment shall not be in conflict with Norwegian mandatory laws
or public policy.

Where a Norwegian party has accepted the jurisdiction of a foreign court in a written agreement, any judgment
rendered pursuant to that agreement will be enforceable in Norway subject to the provisions of sections 4-6 and 19-16 of
the Dispute Act.

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters
(the "2012 Brussels Regulation"), a judgement entered against a company incorporated in Sweden (a "Swedish party")
in the courts of a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal requirements of
the 2012 Brussels Regulation without any declaration of enforceability being required. It should be noted, however, that a
party may apply for refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an
application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (tingsrätt).

Pursuant to the 2012 Brussels Regulation, if a judgement contains a measure or an order which is not known under
the laws of the Member State in which the recognition of the judgement is invoked or in which the enforcement of the
judgement, the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent possible, be
adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has equivalent effects attached to it and
which pursues similar aims and interests.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgements in Civil and
Commercial Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a Contracting
Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will provided that a
motion for enforcement has been filed and granted with the relevant district court, be enforceable in Sweden if it meets the
formal requirements under the Lugano Convention.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, concluded on June 30, 2005
(the "Hague Convention") judgments issued by courts in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that
are based on exclusive choice of court agreement concluded in civil or commercial matters will, provided that such
judgment has effect and is enforceable in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, be recognized or
enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without a retrial on its merits in accordance with, and subject to the exceptions
and limitations of, the Hague Convention, and recognition or enforcement may be refused by Swedish courts and executive
authorities only on the grounds specified in the Hague Convention. In case any such grounds obtain, or in case a relevant
Swedish court determines that there is no exclusive choice of court agreement, a judgement rendered in the courts of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland against a Swedish party would not be recognized or enforceable in
Sweden as a matter of right without a retrial on its merits.

A judgement entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the 2012
Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the 2012 Brussels Regulation), a Contracting
Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention), for example, the United States, or a judgment entered against a Swedish party
in the courts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is not based on an exclusive choice of
court agreement, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on its merits.
Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by the courts of such state, would not be directly enforceable,
either in whole or in part, in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law
action on the judgement debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive
or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgement rendered by the courts of such a state may be regarded


-----

as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish
authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.

Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority
in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability, the translation into Swedish of any
relevant document. Further assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign
proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations.

Swedish courts may award judgements or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the
judgement debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgement debt (even though denominated in a foreign
currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgement creditor
may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment

not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kroner.

It is not established by Swedish juridical precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a

bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish Party giving such powers.

### Notes to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements

##### 1. General information 1.1 Corporate information

Boels Topholding B.V. (the ‘Company’) is located at Dr. Nolenslaan 140, Sittard. The company is registered under
registration number 60885602 with the Chamber of Commerce.

The ultimate parent and controlling party is Mr. P.B.M. Boels.

##### 1.2 Group operations

The operations of Boels Topholding B.V. and its group companies (“the Group”) are mainly comprised of:

  - Renting all kinds of equipment and machinery to businesses as well as private individuals

  - Selling used and new equipment and machinery

Revenues are generated both in The Netherlands as well as in several foreign markets within Europe.

##### 2. Preparation basis 2.1. Accounting basis

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
_Financial Reporting and should be read in addition to the latest annual consolidated financial statements of the_
Group for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

##### 2.2. Going concern

The management board has, at the time of approving the consolidated condensed interim financial statements, a
reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial
statements.

##### 2.3. Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Euros (EUR/€), which is the
Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise
indicated.

##### 2.4. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 _Interim_
_Financial Reporting requires management to make judgements (other than those involving estimations)_ that have
a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported


-----

amounts in these consolidated condensed financial statements. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities
affected in future periods.

Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management
believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Group evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. These
estimates are inherently subject to judgement and actual results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The areas involving significant estimates and judgements are:

   - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate and lease term of leases;
   - Deferred tax assets;
   - Impairment tests for intangible assets with an indefinite useful life;
   - Provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets;
   - Expected useful life and residual value of tangible fixed assets;
   - Measurement of financial instruments at fair value;
   - Valuation of financial assets.

##### 3. Significant accounting policies
The Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting
policies adopted in the Group’s most recent annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

##### 4. Significant developments

**_4.1_** **_Geopolitical situation in Russia/Ukraine_**

Boels is obviously very concerned about the situation in Russia and the impact this has on the entire world. The
war in Ukraine has destabilized the financial and commodity markets, resulting in an uncertain economic situation
in Europe. Boels has only indirect presence in Russia, and no direct presence in Ukraine. Boels does not source
from Russia or Ukraine.

The Group owns 50% of Fortrent Oy, an equally held joint venture with Ramirent. Fortrent Oy operates in Russia.
Boels has no operational involvement in this joint venture, which functions as a stand-alone company in every
respect. Fortrent Oy is a construction machinery and equipment rental company operating in Russia. It holds a
100% share in the company Fortrent LLC.

As a result of the war in Ukraine, the shareholders decided to end their investment in Russia and to sell the
company Fortrent LLC. Considering the level of uncertainty on its business operations in Russia and the high
volatility of the Ruble, Boels has fully impaired its investment in Fortrent since 2022. For the six month period
ended June 30, 2023, this includes the reversal of the net result of Fortrent (gain of EUR 1.1 million for the period
ending June 30, 2023).


-----

**_4.2_** **_Financing_**

During the reporting period, Boels Topholding B.V. attracted new financing by securitizing part of the accounts
receivables of the operating businesses Boels Verhuur B.V., Boels Rental Germany GmbH, and Boels Verhuur
NV. Consequently, at June 30, 2023 EUR 87.5 million of accounts receivables are securitized. The remaining
accounts receivable balance of EUR 144.7 million is not securitized. Effective in June 2023, this transaction
resulted in a EUR 51.2 million loan. At June 30, 2023, the balance of the loan equals EUR 48.1 million, presented
under Current Financial Liabilities.

This transaction is facilitated by the newly created entity Boels Rental Finance B.V., to which the Group holds no
voting rights. However, as the Group is exposed to the variability of returns from the performance of Boels Rental
Finance B.V. and as Boels Rental Finance B.V.’s operations are dependent on the decisions made by the Group,
Boels Rental Finance B.V. is consolidated and included in the Financial Statements of the Group.

The accounts receivables are sold to Boels Rental Finance B.V., which is consolidated into the Financial
Statements of the Group. As the Group effectively retains the economic ownership of the accounts receivables,
the accounts receivables are included in Boels’ financial accounts. The agreement is subject to a floating
EURIBOR-based interest rate with a fixed markup.

The loan is included in the EUR 199.7 million presented as Current liabilities – Financial Liabilities, together with a
EUR 50.0 million draw of the Revolving Credit Facility, EUR 17.2 million new loans resulting from acquisitions,
and EUR 81.5 million negative bank balances.

**_4.3_** **_Dividend distribution_**

In March 2023, Boels distributed EUR 13 million dividend to its shareholders. This dividend is distributed for EUR
6.8 million in cash, the remainder is settled with the outstanding receivables from related parties. Dividends
distributed are disclosed in the consolidated condensed statement of cash flows and in the consolidated
condensed statement of changes in equity.

**_4.4_** **_Acquisitions_**

Acquisitions of new businesses during the reporting period were made to strengthen our market position and local
presence in the region. These acquisitions affect the comparability of the consolidated condensed interim financial
statements. The consolidated condensed interim financial statements, include per May 2023 the activity of:

   - Hyresbutiken, Sweden. We entered into an agreement to acquire assets of Hyresbutiken. Hyresbutiken is
a rental company in Skellefteå with strong roots and a history of continuous and profitable growth.
   - BAS Maskinutleie, Norway. BAS Maskinutleie serves the construction market from eight geographically
spread locations in Norway. BAS Maskinutleie is known for its wide range of equipment, extensive rental
services and great expertise.
   - Safelift, Germany. We entered into an agreement to acquire assets of Safelift. Safelift is has a deep
experience in the hoisting and lifting industry.
   - KraftX, Sweden. KraftX is specialized in the rental of power generators and emergency power supply and
services the Swedish market from nine outlets.
   - Illumin8, United Kingdom. Illimin8 provides lightning solutions throughout the UK and is especially strong
in the events sector.

The goodwill arising from these acquisitions has been calculated as follows (x € 1,000).


-----

**Total**
Consideration 55,519
Fair value of net identifiable assets 30,724
Goodwill 24,795

As a result of these acquisitions, goodwill increased by EUR 24.8 million. There are no significant contingencies
embedded in the considerations. The acquisitions are accounted for based on the purchase accounting method.
As a result of the timing of the acquisition and the reporting date, the initial recognition of the acquisitions is
provisional in relation to the final measurement of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill is
not amortized, but tested for impairment at the end of each reporting period.

The goodwill is presented as Intangible assets and goodwill, causing an increase of EUR 24.8 million, together
with an increase of EUR 14.8 million due to investments in software, and EUR 8.0 million acquired customer
contracts and other intangibles. On an aggregated basis, this results in the increase in intangible assets and
goodwill from EUR 422 million to EUR 469 million.

**_4.5_** **_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

The movement in Property, plant and equipment primarily relates to fleet assets and is driven by a Gross Capital
Expenditure of EUR 259.3 million, offset by a depreciation expense of EUR 134.6 million, divestments of EUR
18.6 million and a FX-impact of EUR 30.5 million. At June 30, 2023, we committed capital expenditures of EUR
306.0m which are to be received in the course of multiple years.

**_4.6_** **_Sale & Leaseback_**

Per January 2023, a sale and leaseback transaction was conducted with a related party. The consideration has
been determined at EUR 9.8 million which is at arm’s length. As the legal ownership hasn’t been transferred at
June 30, 2023, the consideration is presented as financial asset. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, a
gain on sale and leaseback is recognized of EUR 0.9 million and EUR 0.5 million lease terms have been paid.
The transaction involves the properties at five locations, whose lease contracts all are included in the ROU assets
and lease liabilities at June 30, 2023.

**_4.7_** **_Revenue disaggregation_**

Revenue can be disaggregated based on the geographical region where revenue is generated:

  - The Netherlands;

  - Central Europe, consisting of Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland,
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia;

  - Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; and

  - Other countries, consisting of Italy and the United Kingdom

The following table sets out the revenue generated by each of the geographical regions for the periods indicated.

##### 5. Operating Segments
The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments for the first time as of the period ending June 30, 2023, since the
Group is currently in the process of filing its consolidated financial statements with a securities commission or
other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market. In previous
periods, the Group did not apply IFRS 8 Operating Segments, as it was not required to do so.

We present two business segments based on the geographical regions where revenue is generated:

  - Central Europe, consisting of Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy and the United Kingdom; and

  - Northern Europe, consisting of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania excluding DIY
activities in these countries, which are mapped into Central Europe.

**EBITDA per segment**

EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to
profit for the period as an indicator of our performance or any other measures of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS. We define EBITDA as profit for the year/period before depreciation and amortization
expense, financial income, financial expense, share of profit of joint venture and income tax expense. EBITDA
margin is determined as EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period.

##### 6. Seasonality
Our operations experience a degree of seasonality in the first quarter of each year, driven principally by climatic
conditions in our different regions of operations. For example, in certain regions in which we operate, demand in
the construction and civil engineering markets tends to decrease in winter and during extended periods of
inclement weather while increasing in the summer and during extended periods of mild weather. However, the
seasonality impact on our results of operations is relatively small given regional variations in the response to
working practices in connection with weather, as some regions experience little to no change in operational
activity despite weather variations.

##### 7. Capital and financial risk management
**_Capital management_**

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes share capital and all other equity reserves as
disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group’s objectives in managing capital is to
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns and benefits to stakeholders


-----

and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the group may return capital to shareholders, decrease or increase borrowings or issue new shares. The
primary source of the Group’s liquidity is cash generated from operations. These funds are generally used to fund
capital expenditures and pay interest and taxes.

The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

**_Financial risk management_**

The Group’s principal financial assets include trade receivables, derivatives, other long-term receivables and cash
and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise
borrowings, trade and other payables as well as lease liabilities.

The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the
management of these risks. The Group does not have a formal financial risk management policy program. Instead
the susceptibility of the Group to financial risks is monitored as a part of its daily management of the business.

**_Market Risk_**

The group is exposed to market risk mainly as a result of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency
(i.e. foreign currency risk) and its exposure to interest bearing liabilities such as loans (i.e. interest rate risk).

**_Foreign currency risk_**

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the
Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expenses and their resulting receivable/payable positions are
denominated in a foreign currency).

Boels Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash flows generated in Sweden, Norway, the
United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. Boels Topholding B.V. also incurs currency risk on the net
investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the
United Kingdom.

Management has determined, based on a risk assessment, that some of these currency risks need to be hedged.
This policy is intended to protect the statement of financial position. Forward exchange contracts are used for this
purpose.

At June 30, 2023 forward exchange contracts are outstanding with a nominal value of EUR 383.0 million (December
31, 2022: EUR 250.3 million). The market value of these contracts amount to EUR 2.5 million (December 31, 2022:
EUR 2.4 million). The Group applies hedge accounting with respect to the most material foreign exchange contracts.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating
interest rates. It is the policy of the Group to have a fixed/floating interest rate profile on the interest bearing liabilities
which is fitting with the nature of the Group’s assets.

Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with the hedging policy. As most of the interest bearing liabilities
have a floating interest rate, Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate swaps so that it receives floating


-----

interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is determined to obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest
positions.

To manage interest rate risk, at June 30, 2023 interest rate swaps have been concluded for a nominal amount of
EUR 900 million (2022: EUR 900 million), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of these interest
rate swaps amount to EUR 80,329 thousand (2022: EUR 84,083 thousand).

The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by using level 2 measurement. The valuation
technique used discounts the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in
the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of
the financial year.

As the critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, life and underlying) of the swap contracts and their corresponding
hedged item are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the
value of the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite
direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The Group uses a hypothetical derivative
method for the hedge effectiveness assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness where the critical terms
do not match.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and Boels’
own credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item
attributable to changes in interest rates. The lack of a floor included in certain hedging instruments may cause
additional ineffectiveness. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3-month Euribor.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are
designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on
borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount
accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt
affect profit or loss.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that the Group faces when a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations. Credit risk mainly arises on cash and cash equivalents and receivable balances from
trade and other receivables and other longer-term receivables.

A summary of amounts exposed to credit risk is presented below:

(x € 1,000) **June 30,** **December 31,**

**2023** **2022**

Non-current loans receivable 9,840 2,451
Trade receivables 227,445 210,396
Other receivables 38,848 31,097
Cash and cash equivalents 1,132 17,192
**227,265** **261,163**

Substantially all cash at bank is held with high credit quality financial institutions with credit rating of A- (S&P) or
higher.


-----

As at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no significant increase in credit risk has occurred with respect to the
above noted non-current loans receivable. The expected credit losses for these balances were computed based on
a 12-month expected credit loss and was estimated to be remote.

Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk in trade receivables as a result of
the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only made to customers that meet the Group’s
credit rating requirements. Goods and services are sold subject to payment terms, the majority ranging between 15
to 60 days. A different payment period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are
demanded, including guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms
per customer. Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored and legal action is taken against debtors with
long outstanding balances. The exposure to long-outstanding balances exceeding the post-paid terms are however
not considered to be significant.

The Group applies IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade receivables. The expected
credit losses are estimated primarily by virtue of a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast
direction of conditions at the reporting date.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity
is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available credit facilities by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

##### 8. Subsequent events
No material, non-adjusting events occurred after the reporting period.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED**
**31 DECEMBER 2022**

**1** **General information**
**1.1** **Corporate information**
Boels Topholding B.V. (the ‘Company’) is located at Dr. Nolenslaan 140, Sittard. The company is
registered under registration number 60885602 with the Chamber of Commerce.

The ultimate parent and controlling party is Mr. P.B.M. Boels.

**1.2** **Group operations**
The operations of Boels Topholding B.V. and its group companies (“the Boels Group”) are mainly
comprised of:

- Renting all kinds of equipment and machinery to businesses as well as private individuals

- Selling used and new equipment and machinery

Revenues are generated both in The Netherlands as well as in several foreign markets within
Europe.

The consolidation accounting policy is included in note 3.1 and the consolidated companies are
listed in note 27.

**1.3** **Geopolitical situation in Russia/Ukraine**
Boels is obviously very concerned about the situation in Russia and the impact this has on
the entire world. The war in Ukraine has destabilized the financial and commodity markets,
resulting in an uncertain economic situation in Europe. Boels has only indirect presence in
Russia, and no direct presence in Ukraine. Boels does not source from Russia or Ukraine.

The Group owns 50% of Fortrent Oy, an equally held joint venture with Ramirent. Fortrent Oy
operates in Russia. Boels has no operational involvement in this joint venture, which functions as
a stand-alone company in every respect.

As a result of the war in Ukraine, the shareholders decided to end their investment in Russia and
to sell the company Fortrent LLC. Considering the level of uncertainty on its business operations
in Russia and the high volatility of the Ruble, Boels has fully impaired its investment in Fortrent.


This includes:

- Reversal of the net result of Fortrent (gain of € 2.6 million for the financial year);

- Depreciate the receivable with Fortrent, considering a risk of non-collectability (balance
of € 0.9 million);

- Record a write-down of € 10.9 million, representing the full amount of the carrying value
of its investment in Fortrent.

**2** **Preparation basis**
**2.1** **Accounting basis**
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and in accordance
with Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Since the income statement of the Company is
included in the consolidated financial statements, an abridged income statement has been
disclosed in the company financial statements in accordance with Section 402, Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code.

This is the first set of the Group’s annual financial statements in which IFRS have been applied.
The Group presented its previous consolidated financial statements up to December 31, 2021 in
accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code (NL GAAP). The transition disclosures
are presented in note 30.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis unless
otherwise indicated. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration
given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of
whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the
characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for
measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is
determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of
IFRS 16, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value,
such as ‘value in use’ in IAS 36 and ‘net realisable value’ in IAS 2.


-----

**2.2. Going concern**
The management board has, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable
expectation that the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing the financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the management board on
April 21[st], 2023.

**2.3 Functional and presentation currency**
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (EUR/€), which is the Company’s
functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise
indicated.

**2.4 Use of estimates and judgements**
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant
impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions which affect the
reported amounts in these consolidated financial statements. Uncertainty about these
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Group evaluates its
estimates on an ongoing basis. These estimates are inherently subject to judgement and actual
results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The areas involving significant estimates and judgements are:

- Estimating the incremental borrowing rate and lease term of leases;

- Deferred tax assets;

- Impairment tests for intangible assets with an indefinite useful life;

- Provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets;

- Expected useful life and residual value of tangible fixed assets;

- Measurement of financial instruments at fair value;

- Valuation of financial assets.


**3** **Significant accounting policies**
**3.1** **Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company
and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved when the Company:

- has the power over the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances
indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and
ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in profit or loss from the date the Company
gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring
the accounting policies used into line with the Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to
transactions between the members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners
of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income
of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Fortrent Oy, Vanta (Finland) (50% - shareholding) qualifies as a joint venture and the Group’s share
in equity has been accounted for - refer to note 3.6 and 7 for further information.


-----

**3.2 Business combinations**
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum
of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by
the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss
as incurred if the costs do not relate to the issue of debt or equity instruments.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

**3.3 Foreign currencies**
In preparing the financial statements of the Group entities, transactions in currencies other
than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing
at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost
are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except
for exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks
(see below under financial instruments/hedge accounting).

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities
of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period,
unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange
rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.


**3.4 Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost and subsequently stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, except for land, which
is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

Land and buildings are originally stated at historical cost plus expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition thereof. Other assets are valued at historical cost, where the
manufacturing price is comprised of the cost of raw materials and consumables and also
includes expenditure directly attributable to an asset’s manufacturing, including installation
costs.

Expenditure incurred subsequently for major services, additions to or replacements of parts
of property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised
when replaced. Day-to-day servicing costs are included in profit or loss in the year in which
they are incurred.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost less their residual values over their useful
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:

- Land is not depreciated

- Buildings: 2% – 10% per annum

- Machinery and equipment: 5% – 33% per annum

- Right-of-use assets: 2% – 50% per annum

- Other assets: 2.5% – 50% per annum

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at
the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for
on a prospective basis.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and the useful
life of the underlying asset. The accounting policy for leases is included in note 3.12.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss
arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.


-----

**3.5 Intangible assets and goodwill**
_Goodwill_
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out in note 3.2. Goodwill is not amortised
but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing for goodwill is further
discussed in notes 3.7 and 6.

The Group’s policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted investments
is discussed in note 3.6.

_Other intangible assets_
Intangible assets that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill
are recognised initially at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are
reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the
same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.

_Brand name_
The Brand name “Cramo” was acquired during the acquisition of the Cramo Group in 2020, before
the transition to IFRS. The brand name has been measured during the purchase price allocation
applying the relief-of-royalty method.

_Customer Contracts_
In past business combinations before the transition to IFRS, part of the purchase price has been
allocated to customer contracts. The initial measurement of these customer contracts was
determined by applying the multi-period excess earnings method and the forecasted revenues
and profits related to these contracts.

_Software_
The software is acquired from external vendors.

The estimated useful lives of the brand name, customer contracts and software are as follow:

- Brand name: 10 Years

- Customer contracts: 5 Years


Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are
expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset,
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount
of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

**3.6 Investments – Equity accounted**
Equity accounted investments includes investments in associates as well as investments
in joint ventures.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a
subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control
over those policies.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions
about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these
financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is
classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5. Under the
equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised initially in the
consolidated statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the
Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint
venture. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group’s
interest in that associate or joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further
losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.

On acquisition of the investment in an associate or a joint venture, any excess of the cost of the
investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of
the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the
investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit
or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.


-----

When a Group entity transacts with an associate or a joint venture of the Group, profits and
losses resulting from the transactions with the associate or joint venture are recognised in the
Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate or joint
venture that are not related to the Group.

**3.7 Impairment of non-current assets**
_Goodwill_
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cashgenerating units (or groups of cash-generating units) expected to benefit from the synergies of
the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
reversed in a subsequent period.

_Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill_
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When
a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also
allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest
group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have
not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its i


Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cashgenerating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss to the
extent that it eliminates the impairment loss which has been recognised for the asset in prior
years.

_Equity accounted investments_
The net investment in an equity accounted investment is assessed for impairment if there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the net investment (a ‘loss event’). An impairment loss is only incurred if that loss
event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that
can be reliably estimated.

When objective evidence of impairment exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment
(including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as a single asset by
comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal)
with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised is not allocated to any asset, including
goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that
impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable
amount of the investment subsequently increases.

**3.8 Inventories**
Inventory is stated at the lower of replacement value, i.e. purchase price and net realisable
value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling
expenses. Net realisable value is determined making allowance for obsolescence of
inventories.

Items of property, plant and equipment that were previously held for rental to others are
transferred to inventories for disposal at their carrying value when they cease to be rented. When
these assets are reclassified to inventory, they cease to be depreciated and are carried at the
lower of cost (carrying amount at the time of transfer) and net realisable value.


-----

**3.9 Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial
position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade
receivables that do not have a significant financing component which are measured at
transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of
financial assets and financial liabilities are added to or deducted from the fair value of the
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.

_Classification of financial assets_
Financial asset debt instruments that meet the following conditions are classified as being
measured subsequently at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The amortised cost of financial assets that are classified as such, are determined in accordance
with the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The Group’s financial asset debt instruments consists mainly of trade receivables, other
receivables, loans and cash and cash equivalents.

_Trade receivables_
Trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, are measured initially
at the transaction price as determined in accordance with IFRS 15. Trade receivables are
subsequently measured at amortised cost.

_Other receivables_
Other receivables relate to unbilled revenue accruals and contract assets. Other receivables are
initially measured at the transaction price as determined in accordance with IFRS 15 and
subsequently measured at amortised cost.

_Loans_
Loans relate to loans to associates, participants and related parties. Loans are measured initially
at fair value and is subsequently measured at amortised cost.


_Cash and cash equivalents_
Cash and cash equivalents are measured initially at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost.

_Impairment of financial assets_
The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected
credit losses (ECL) for trade and other receivables. The expected credit losses are estimated
primarily by virtue of a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the
forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date. The Group also provides for a lifetime
ECL on specific trade and other receivable balances based on individual assessment.

For loans, the Group recognises a lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not
increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that
financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial assets with
a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.
Financial assets are written-off against the loss allowance account when there is information
indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect
of recovery. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under
the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any
recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9,
the estimated ECL is insignificant.

_Classification of financial liabilities_
All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
The Group’s financial liabilities consists mainly of trade and other payables, bank- and other
loans.

_Trade and other payables_
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost.


-----

_Borrowings_
Bank and other loans are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost.

_Derivative financial instruments_
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value
at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair
value at each reporting date. Refer to note 3.10 for the accounting policy on hedge accounting.

_Equity Instruments_
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of the Group relates mainly to
ordinary shares issued.

_Share capital_
Share capital represents the nominal (par) value of issued shares.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the
consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

**3.10 Hedge accounting**
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk in hedges of net investments in foreign operations, or cash flow
hedges.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is
when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:



- There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.

- The effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that
economic relationship.

- The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity
of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging
instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to
the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship
remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances
the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

The group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward contract (i.e. including
the forward elements) as the hedging instrument for all of its hedging relationships involving
forward contracts.

If the hedged item is time-period related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging
reserve is reclassified to profit or loss on a rational basis – the Group applies straight-line
amortisation. Those reclassified amounts are recognised in profit or loss in the same line as the
hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost
of hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified
to profit or loss.

Note 28 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging
purposes.

_Cash flow hedges_
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging
instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve, limited
to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is
included in the ‘Other gains and losses’ line item.


-----

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the
same line as the recognised hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of
the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that
amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof)
ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The discontinuation is
accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to
profit or loss when the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified
immediately to profit or loss.

_Hedges of net investments in foreign operations_
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts relating to the effective portion of the
hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency
translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in profit or loss.

**3.11 Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents include cash-on-hand and bank balances. Bank overdrafts are
included in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.

**3.12 Leases: the Group as a lessee**
The lease portfolio of the Group consists of real-estate leases, vehicle leases and the rental of
equipment. The Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of the
contract and recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the
commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented separately in note 5. The lease liability is presented
as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.


As a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate
non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components
as a single arrangement. The Group has elected the practical expedient to account for lease - and
non-lease components (within a lease) as a single lease component for its vehicle leases.
The Group has not elected the expedient for its real-estate and rental fleet leases and accounts
for lease- and non-lease components separately.

The Group has also elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of
low-value assets and short-term leases (12 months or less). The lease payments associated with
these leases are recognised as an expense within “Other operating expenses” on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

**3.13 Fair value measurement**
IFRS 13 establishes a hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs used to measure fair
value by giving the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities (level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs).
In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be
categorised within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value
measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy at the
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. Levels used in the hierarchy are
as follows:
Level 1: Fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: Fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques which use inputs that
are based on observable market data.
Level 3: Fair values that are determined on the basis of valuation techniques which use inputs
that are not based on observable market data.

_Financial instruments at fair value_
Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value using level 2 measurement.
The valuation technique used is based on observable market data and is provided by the offering
financing institutes.

_Financial instruments at amortised cost_
The majority of the Group financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost using
the effective interest method. The fair values of these instruments are not materially different
from their carrying values, since the instruments are either short-term in nature or the interest
rates are on market terms.


-----

**3.14 Revenue**
The Group recognises revenue mainly from the rental of equipment. Other revenue is earned from
the sale of consumables and smalls as well as additional services relating to equipment rental.

_Equipment rental_
Components of rental contracts relating the use of an asset are accounted for as an operational
lease, with revenue recognised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the lease. Lease
duration generally varies from several days to a few months.

Damage waiver’s taken up by customers do not transfer a separate service and are accounted for
as part of, and over a consistent period with, the associated with the rental.

_Sales and other services_
Other contract components, or contracts which do not pertain to equipment rental, are
recognised as revenue at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer (for
sales) or as the performance obligation is satisfied (for other services). Revenue is measured
based on the total consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled from these contracts
(excluding contract consideration allocated to equipment rental).

**3.15 Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive)
as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised
as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of
money is material).

**3.16 Employee benefits**
_Short-term and other long-term employee benefits_
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the
undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries,
annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted
amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.


Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the
present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect
of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.

_Retirement benefits_
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. Boels Topholding B.V. pays
contributions to pension funds and insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for
paying contributions, Boels Topholding B.V. has no other obligations to pay further contributions
by virtue of these pension plans. No provision is made for probable future increase of premium.
The employees bear the actuarial and investment risk. Payments to defined contribution
retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service
entitling them to the contributions. Prepaid contributions are recognised as prepayments and
accrued income to the extent that this will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash
refund.
Of the foreign group companies of the Group, only Boels Rental Germany GmbH, Cramo AB and
Cramo Services Sweden AB have its own pension plan as a result of a pension arrangement from
the past that is applicable for a specific group of former Cramo AG employees. These plans
qualify as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19.

The Group has elected not to apply the IAS 19 disclosure principles applicable to defined benefit
plans as the quantitative and qualitative effect is immaterial.

**3.17 Taxes**
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is
considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority.
The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable.


-----

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow
all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that
would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period,
to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities
on a net basis.

_Current tax and deferred tax for the year_
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that
are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current
and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business
combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

_Goodwill_
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of
CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or
liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units or groups of CGUs. Goodwill is tested for
impairment, annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

In 2022, there were multiple groups of CGUs with allocated goodwill, the most significant being
for the goodwill of the Cramo acquisition which has been allocated to Scandinavia, Finland and
Baltics, and Central Europe.

Goodwill is allocated to the respective CGU’s as indicated below:

Finland and Central
(x €1,000) Scandinavia Baltics Europe Total

Carrying value as at December 31, 2022 158,169 81,764 134,003 373,936

Carrying value as at December 31, 2021 158,169 81,764 122,038 361,970

Carrying value as at January 1, 2021 158,169 81,764 122,038 361,970

The impairment test is based on cash flow projections for five years. CGU’s are tested for
impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each group of CGU to its recoverable amount.

Scandinavia
The recoverable amount of the Scandinavia CGU, is determined based on a value in use
calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by
management covering a five-year period and a post-tax discount rate of 9.1% per annum
(2021: 6.3% per annum) calculated by the weighted average cost of capital method as derived
through the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The pre-tax discount rate equals 10.9% (2021: 7.4%).
The key assumptions used by management in setting the financial forecasts for the initial
five-year period were as follows:

_Forecast sales growth rates_
Forecast sales growth rates are based on past experience adjusted for a continued strong growth
rate as historically seen. Revenue is expected to grow at 2.2%.


_Operating profits_
Operating profits are forecasted based on historical experience of operating margins adjusted
for the impact of market expectations.

_Cash conversion_
Cash conversion is the ratio of operating cash flows to operating profit. Management forecasts
cash conversion rates based on historical experience.

Finland and Baltics
The recoverable amount of the Finland and Baltics CGU, is determined based on a value in
use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by
management covering a five-year period and a post-tax discount rate of 9.8% per annum
(2021: 6.7% per annum) calculated by the weighted average cost of capital method as derived
through the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The pre-tax discount rate equals 11.8% (2021: 7.9%).

management covering a five-year period and a post-tax discount rate of 9.3% per annum
(2021: 6.4% per annum) calculated by the weighted average cost of capital method as derived

for the impact of market expectations.

_Cash conversion_
Cash conversion is the ratio of operating cash flows to operating profit. Management forecasts
cash conversion rates based on historical experience.

_Sensitivity analysis_
The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the
key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each of the group of CGUs to
which goodwill is allocated. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the
key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the CGUs are based would not cause the
aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the related CGUs.

Based on the impairment analysis no impairment was recognized as at 31 December 2022,
31 December 2021 or 1 January 2021.

_Impairment_
For the purpose of impairment testing, no impairment was identified as at 31 December 2022,
31 December 2021 or 1 January 2021 following the Group’s annual impairment test on Goodwill.
Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified for other intangible assets and
detailed impairment testing was not required for these assets.

Temporary differences 5,099 1,874 5,988

**Carrying value at 31 December** **16,873** **5,323** **11,246**

Temporary differences relate to taxable temporary differences between the tax base of property,
plant and equipment, and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.

From the total amount, € 3.3 million is expected to be realized within one year. From the losses
available for offsetting against future taxable income at 31 December 2022 € 1.4 million has an
expiration date of 2030.


In recognizing the above noted deferred tax assets, management has assessed that sufficient
probable future taxable profits will exist against which the deductible temporary differences
and carry-forward losses can be utilized.

differences to the amount of 0 (31 December 2021: € 0, 1 January 2021: € 0) for which no deferred
tax assets were recognized. At the dates 31 December 2021 and 1 January 2021 the Group could
not reliably estimate that probable future taxable profits would be available against which these
carry-forward losses and deductible temporary differences could be utilized and as such,
no deferred tax assets were recognized.

**28 Capital and financial risk management**

_Capital management_
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes share capital and all other
equity reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group’s
objectives in managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
in order to provide returns and benefits to stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital
structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure,
the group may return capital to shareholders, decrease or increase borrowings or issue new
shares. The primary source of the Group’s liquidity is cash generated from operations.
These funds are generally used to fund capital expenditures and pay interest and taxes.

The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.


The Group’s aim is for a financing structure that ensures continuing operations and minimises
cost of equity. For this, flexibility and access to the financial markets are important conditions.
The Group monitors its financing structure using a gearing ratio, among other factors.

The Group has a gearing ratio of 321 per cent (see below) per 31 December 2022 determined
as the proportion of net debt to equity.

The gearing ratio at the year-end is as follows:

(x €1,000) 31-12-2022 31-12-2021

Debt 1,647,382 1,634,768

Cash and cash equivalents 17,192 62,158

Net debt **1,630,190** **1,572,610**

Equity 508,571 350,564

Net debt to equity ratio 321% 449%

Debt is defined as long- and short-term borrowings and lease liabilities (excluding derivatives
and financial guarantee contracts). Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group that are
managed as capital.

_Financial risk management_
The Group’s principal financial assets include trade receivables, derivatives, other long-term
receivables and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group’s
principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other payables as well as lease
liabilities.

The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior
management oversees the management of these risks. The Group does not have a formal
financial risk management policy program. Instead the susceptibility of the Group to financial
risks is monitored as a part of its daily management of the business.


-----

_Market Risk_
The group is exposed to market risk mainly as a result of financial instruments denominated
in a foreign currency (i.e. foreign currency risk) and its exposure to interest bearing liabilities
such as loans (i.e. interest rate risk).

_Foreign currency risk_
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate because
of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign
exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expenses
and their resulting receivable/payable positions are denominated in a foreign currency).

Boels Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash flows generated in
Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. Boels Topholding B.V.
also incurs currency risk on the net investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary,
Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Management has determined, based on a risk assessment, that some of these currency risks
need to be hedged. This policy is intended to protect the statement of financial position.
Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose.

At 31 December 2022 forward exchange contracts are outstanding with a nominal value
of € 250.3 million (2021: € 118.5 million). The market value of these contracts amount to
€ 2.4 million (2021: € (1.3 million)). The Group applies hedge accounting with respect to the
most material foreign exchange contracts.

_Interest rate risk_
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both
fixed and floating interest rates. It is the policy of the Group to have a fixed/floating interest rate
profile on the interest bearing liabilities which is fitting with the nature of the Group’s assets.

Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with the hedging policy. As most of the interest
bearing liabilities have a floating interest rate, Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate
swaps so that it receives floating interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is determined to
obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest positions.


To manage interest rate risk, at 31 December 2022 interest rate swaps have been concluded
for a nominal amount of € 900 million (2021: € 900 million), with a duration of less than 5 years.
The market value of these interest rate swaps amount to € 84,083 thousand (2021:
€ 6,288 thousand).

The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the
future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the
contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding
balances at the end of the financial year.

As the critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, life and underlying) of the swap contracts and
their corresponding hedged item are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment
of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the swap contracts and the value of the
corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to
movements in the underlying interest rates. The Group uses a hypothetical derivative method
for the hedge effectiveness assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness where
the critical terms do not match.

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of
the counterparty and Boels’ own credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which
is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in interest rates.
The lack of a floor included in certain hedging instruments may cause additional
ineffectiveness. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging
relationships.

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps
is 3-month Euribor. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest
rate on a net basis.

All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest
amounts are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting
from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments
on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit
or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.


-----

_Credit risk_
Credit risk is the risk that the Group faces when a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk mainly arises on cash and cash
equivalents and receivable balances from trade and other receivables and other longer-term
receivables.

A summary of amounts exposed to credit risk is presented below:

(x €1,000) Notes 31-12-2022 31-12-2021 01-01-2021

Non-current loans receivable 8 2,451 2,402 4,819

Trade receivables 10 210,396 194,078 170,995

Other receivables 10 31,097 28,140 19,760

Cash and cash equivalents 11 17,192 62,158 151,337

Substantially all cash at bank is held with high credit quality financial institutions with credit
rating of A- (S&P) or higher.

As at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 1 January 2021, no significant increase in credit
risk has occurred with respect to the above noted non-current loans receivable. The expected
credit losses for these balances were computed based on a 12-month expected credit loss and
was estimated to be remote.

Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk in trade
receivables as a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only
made to customers that meet the Group’s credit rating requirements. Goods and services are
sold subject to payment terms, the majority ranging between 15 to 60 days. A different payment
period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded, including
guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and payment terms
per customer. Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored and legal action is taken
against debtors with long outstanding balances. The exposure to long-outstanding balances
exceeding the post-paid terms are however not considered to be significant.


The Group applies IFRS 9 and recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade
receivables. The expected credit losses are estimated primarily by virtue of a provision matrix
based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for general economic conditions
and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the
reporting date.

_Liquidity risk_
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will meet
its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available credit facilities
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles
of financial assets and liabilities.

**29 29. Contingencies and commitments not included in the balance sheet**

_Commitments_
At 31 December 2022, the Group had commitments of € 356 million (31 December 2021:
€ 257 million, 1 January 2021: € 86 million relating to capital expenditures.

_Guarantees_
The Group has provided the following guarantees at 31 December 2022:

At year end, bank guarantees issued by Boels Topholding B.V. and its subsidiaries amounted
to € 3,350k (31 December 2021: € 3,080k). At December 31, 2022 also company guarantees have
been issued by Boels Topholding B.V. and its subsidiaries in amount to € 21,500k
(31 December 2021: € 26,495k).

**30 First time adoption of IFRS**
These consolidated financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2022, are the first
the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. For periods up to and including the year ended
31 December 2021, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP.


-----

Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable
as at 31 December 2022, together with the comparative period data for the year ended
31 December 2021. In preparing the financial statements, the Group’s opening statement of
financial position was prepared as at 1 January 2021, the Group’s date of transition to IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its Dutch GAAP
financial statements, including the statement of financial position as at 1 January 2021 and
the financial statements as of, and for, the year ended 31 December 2021.

_Exemptions applied_
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS 1’) allows some
exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under IFRS.

_Business combinations_
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to either acquisitions of subsidiaries that
are considered businesses under IFRS, or acquisitions of interests in associates and joint
ventures that occurred before 1 January 2021. Use of this exemption means that the Dutch GAAP
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under IFRS, are their
deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in
accordance with IFRS. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under IFRS are
excluded from the opening IFRS statement of financial position. The Group did not recognise any
assets or liabilities that were not recognised under Dutch GAAP or excluded any previously
recognised amounts as a result of IFRS recognition requirements.

IFRS 1 also requires that the Dutch GAAP carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening
IFRS statement of financial position (apart from adjustments for goodwill impairment and the
recognition or derecognition of intangible assets). In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has
tested goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to IFRS.

_The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates_
The Group has not applied IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill from business combinations that occurred
before the date of transition to IFRS. Such fair value adjustments and goodwill are treated as
assets and liabilities of the parent rather than as assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore,
those assets and liabilities are already expressed in the functional currency of the parent or are
non-monetary foreign currency items and no further translation differences occur.

Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero


_Leases_
The Group assessed all contracts existing at 1 January 2021 to determine whether a contract
contains a lease based upon the conditions in place as at 1 January 2021. Lease liabilities were
measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2021. Right-of-use assets were measured at the amount
equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments
relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before
1 January 2021. The lease payments associated with leases for which the lease term ends within
12 months of the date of transition to IFRS and leases for which the underlying asset is of low
value have been recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures_
If the subsidiary (or associate or joint venture) became a first-time adopter of IFRS before
the parent of the Group, in the parent’s consolidated financial statements, the assets and
liabilities of the subsidiary (or associate or joint venture) is measured at the same amounts
as in the subsidiary’s (or associate’s or joint venture’s) financial statements (after adjusting
for consolidation and equity accounting adjustments and for the effects of the business
combination in which the entity acquired the subsidiary).

_Revenue_
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers has not been applied to revenue contract that
occurred before 1 January 2021. The use of this exemption means that the transition date per
IFRS 1 is used as the IFRS 15 date of initial application therefore the Group is not required to
restate contracts that were completed before the transition date. Thus, the Group applies
the IFRS 15 standard from 1 January 2021.

_Estimates_
The estimates at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 are consistent with those made for the
same dates in accordance with Dutch GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in
accounting policies). The estimates used by the Group to present these amounts in accordance
with IFRS reflect conditions at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021.

*Notes to the reconciliation of equity as at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 and
reconciliation of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended
31 December 2021

A. Goodwill
Under Dutch GAAP, goodwill was capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis. Goodwill
under IFRS is required to be capitalised, however, no amortisation thereof takes place.
The amortisation for the periods presented have therefore been reversed within profit or loss.
The impact is a reversal of € 46.533 thousand amortisation for the year ended 31 December 2021.

B. Leases
At the date of transition to IFRS, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement
approach for all leases except for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (12 months
or less). As at 1 January 2021:

- Right-of-use assets of € 186,676 thousand were recognised (31 December 2021:
€ 230,501 thousand);

- Lease liabilities of € 183,873 thousand were recognised (31 December 2021:
)


Items that may be reclassified to profit and loss,
net of tax - - 
Share of other comprehensive income of joint venture - - 
Fair value gain/(loss) arising on hedging instruments
during the period H - 6,288 6,288

Cumulative (gain)/loss arising on hedging instruments
reclassified to profit and loss - - 
Exchange differences on translation of foreign
operation F 2,452 (12,638) (10,185)

**Total comprehensive income for the year** **40,624** **35,947** **76,574**


-----

- A deferred tax liability of € 525 thousand (31 December 2021: € 960 thousand) was
recognised; and

- The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities was 4.93%
(31 December 2021: 2.97%).

C. Trade and other receivables
The adoption of IFRS has fundamentally changed the Group’s accounting for impairment losses
for financial assets by replacing the incurred loss approach under Dutch GAAP with a forwardlooking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS requires the Group to recognise an allowance
for ECLs for all financial asset debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and
contract assets. At the date of transition to IFRS, the application of the ECL approach did not
have an impact on the impairment loss allowance recognised previously under Dutch GAAP for
trade and other receivables as well as other long term receivables.

D. Revenue
Under Dutch GAAP, sales made through the DIY partner business were recognised on a net
(agent) basis. The application of IFRS 15 to these contracts has resulted in the recognition of
revenue on a gross (principle) basis and accordingly an increase in revenue recognised in the
2021 financial year.

E. Deferred tax
The various transitional adjustments results in different temporary differences. Deferred tax
adjustments are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction in retained earnings.

F. Foreign currency translation
Under Dutch GAAP, the Group recognised translation differences on foreign operations in a
separate component of equity. Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign
operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2021. The resulting adjustment was recognised
against retained earnings.

G. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows arising from payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified as
cash outflows from financing activities. Therefore, cash inflows from operating activities
increased by € 53,819 thousand and cash outflows from financing activities increased by the
same amount for the year ended 31 December 2021.

H. Hedge accounting


I. Defined benefit obligation
Defined benefit plan obligation are recognized and measured using the projected unit credit
method. The pension liability has been recognized in full against retained earnings.

J. Inventory reclass
Fleet items no longer held for rental, but rather held for sale are classified as inventory.

**31** **Subsequent events**
In 2023, Boels Group acquired Hyresbutiken AB in Skellefteå in northern Sweden, a local rental
company with strong roots and a history of continuous and profitable growth.

Furthermore Boels Rental announced the acquisition Norwegian BAS Maskinutleie. BAS Maskinutleie
is a Norwegian rental company. Established in 2008 as part of Backe, BAS Maskinutleie serves
the construction market from eight geographically spread locations. BAS Maskinutleie is known
for its wide range of equipment, extensive rental services and great expertise.

These acquisitions represent an annual turnover of approximately € 30 million. The financing of
these acquisitions was done by the existing credit facilities with the banks. The total acquisition
price for these acquisitions was in the range of € 45 – 65 million.

**32 Standards issued but not yet effective**
The amended standards that are issued but not yet effective as at December 31, 2022
are listed below:
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
Amendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

a Single Transaction

##### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the shareholders of Boels Topholding B.V.

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022 INCLUDED IN**
**THE ANNUAL REPORT**

**Our opinion**
We have audited the financial statements 2022 of Boels Topholding B.V., based in Sittard. The
financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements and the company financial
statements.

In our opinion:

- The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of Boels Topholding B.V. as at 31 December 2022, and of its result and its
cash flows for 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

- The accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of Boels Topholding B.V. as at 31 December 2022, and of its result for 2022 in
accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

The consolidated financial statements comprise:
1. The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022.
2. The following statements for 2022: the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other
comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows.
3. The notes comprising material policy information.

The company financial statements comprise:
1. The company balance sheet as at 31 December 2022.
2. The company income statement for 2022.
3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory
information

**Basis for our opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report.

We are independent of Boels Topholding B.V. in accordance with the Wet toezicht


accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion

**Information in support of our opinion**
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion
was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these
matters.

**Audit approach fraud risks**
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due
to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the
components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and
management’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal
control and how the Board of Directors exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We note
that management has not formalised its fraud risk assessment and fraud management strategy.

We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control, including internal
fraud & integrity protocols and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the
implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of
internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.

As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to
financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, and bribery and corruption, where deemed
necessary, in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these
factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due fraud is present.

We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures:

_•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to management override of controls:_
We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud as management is in a unique
position to perpetrate fraud because of management’s assumed ability to manipulate


-----

affecting the financial statements. We have pinpointed the possible incentives of
management on meeting the loan covenants and the long term and yearly bonus plan for the
strategic board members. In this respect EBITDA serves as the key performance indicator
for the entity and management.

_•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition:_
We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition.
This risk relates to the occurrence of revenues for non-transactional rental revenue
transactions.

To respond to these fraud risks we performed the following procedures:

- We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives from the
strategic board, directors, finance employees, risk manager and the general counsel.

- We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group,
particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be
indicative of fraudulent financial reporting.

- We evaluated all internally registered fraud instances in financial year 2022 and evaluated
whether management’s follow up is appropriate.

- We have performed data analytics, including detailed testing of journal entries in the
financial administration (SAP/IBS) based on certain risk-based characteristics, as part of
our audit approach to address fraud risks.

- We performed supplementary substantive audit procedures, such as detailed testing of
top-down journal entries.

- We have reconciled the rental- and financial system on detailed level and performed
extensive sampling testing on revenue postings not orginating from the rental system and
on the accrual of customer bonusses.

- We have included the fraud risks as specific focus area in the group instructions to the
component audit teams and have conducted site visits on a number of business locations in
Sweden, Norway and Finland.

- We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome
of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or
non-compliance.

Our audit procedures for the year as specified in this paragraph did not lead to indications for
fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.


**Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations**
We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the Company through discussion with strategic
Board members, reading minutes and reports of internal audit.

As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from noncompliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and regulations:
adherence to (corporate) tax law and financial reporting regulations, the requirements under the
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect on the financial statements as an
integrated part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the related financial
statements.

We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and
regulations generally recognized to have a direct effect on the financial statements.
Apart from these, the Boels Topholding B.V. is subject to other laws and regulations where the
consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in
the financial statements, for instance, through imposing fines or litigation.

Given the nature of Boels Topholding B.V.’s business and the complexity of the act on the
Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (‘WWFT’), and current EU sanctions
with regards to the joint venture in Russia, there could be a risk of non-compliance with the
requirements of such laws and regulations. In addition, we considered major laws and regulations
applicable to listed companies.

Our procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do not have a
direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the
business, to Boels Topholding B.V.’s ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties
(e.g., compliance with the terms of operating licenses and permits or compliance with
environmental regulations) and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may
have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking
specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that
may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of
management, the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and others within Boels Topholding
B.V.’s as to whether the Boels Topholding B.V. is in compliance with such laws and regulations and
(ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities to help
identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the i


-----

Naturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit.
Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or
non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.

**Audit approach going concern**
Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of management, are outlined under the
prevailing standards in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements”
section below. Management has assessed the going concern assumption, as part of the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that no events or
conditions give rise to doubt about the ability of the group to continue in operation of at least
twelve months after the date of the financial statements. We have obtained management’s
assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and have assessed the going
concern assumption applied. As part of our procedures, we evaluated whether sufficient
appropriate audit evidence has been obtained regarding, and have concluded on, the
appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Based on these procedures, we did not
identify any reportable findings related to the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern

**REPORT ON THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT**

the annual report contains other information, in addition to the financial statements and our
auditor’s report thereon.

The other information consists of:

- Board of Directors’ report.

- Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

- Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements.

- Contains all the information regarding the management report and the other information as
required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained
through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the
other information contains material misstatements.


By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the
Management Board’s Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the
other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the financial statements**
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, The Board of Directors is responsible for such internal control as The Board of
Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, The Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting
frameworks mentioned, the Board of Directors should prepare the financial statements using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt
on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we
may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and i


-----

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and
independence requirements. Our audit included among others:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

- Concluding on the appropriateness of the Board of Directos’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a
going concern.

- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures.

- Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing,
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or
the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for
which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or
specific items.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal
control that we identified during our audit.

the company plus any directly attributable expenses. If the acquisition price exceeds the net
amount of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, the excess is capitalised as
goodwill under intangible assets.

Entities continue to be consolidated until they are sold. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases or if they are classified as disposal groups held for sale.

**1.6** **Notes to the cash flow statement**
The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The cash items
disclosed in the cash flow statement are comprised of cash excluding bank overdrafts at credit
institutions which have been presented as proceeds and repayments of loans under the cash
flow generated from financing activities. Cash flows denominated in foreign currencies have
been translated at average estimated exchange rates. Interest paid and received, dividends
received and income taxes are included in cash from operating activities. Dividends and capital
reductions paid are recognised as cash used in financing activities.


-----

**1.7** **Estimates**
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the relevant rules requires
the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. If necessary for the
purposes of providing the view required under Article 362(1), Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code,
the nature of these estimates and judgments, including the related assumptions, is disclosed
in the notes to the financial statement items in question.

**2** **Accounting policies for the balance sheet**
**2.1** **General information**
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the statutory
provisions of Part 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code and the firm pronouncements in the
Guidelines for Annual Reporting in the Netherlands as issued by the Dutch Accounting
Standards Board.

The accounting policies have been based on going concern assumptions.

In general, assets and liabilities are stated at the amounts at which they were acquired or
incurred, or current value. If not specifically stated otherwise, they are recognised at the
amounts at which they were acquired or incurred. The balance sheet, income statement
and cash flow statement include references to the notes.

**2.2 Geopolitical situation Russia/Ukraine**
Boels is obviously very concerned about the situation in Russia and the impact this has on the
entire world. Boels is not impacted by the Russia/Ukraine geopolitical situation, other than the
impact it may have on the general economy in Europe. Boels has no presence in Russia or in
Ukraine nor does it service any customers in those regions. Boels does not source from Russia
or Ukraine.

The Group owns 50% of Fortrent Oy, an equally held joint venture with Ramirent. Fortrent Oy
operates in Russia. Boels has no operational involvement in this joint venture, which functions
as a stand-alone company in every respect.
Fortrent not being exclusively controlled by the Group, it is consolidated under the equity
method in the Group consolidated financial statements.
Fortrent is generating approx. € 25 million of revenues. In 2021, a net result of € 1.0 million from
this joint venture is included in Boels’ net result. The Group will continue to assess the situation
and the valuation of this joint venture.


**2.3 Prior-year comparison**
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
The presentation of some prior year items in the balance sheet and income statements
has been reclassified in comparison to last years’ annual accounts to comply with the
accounting laws and regulations applicable to this financial statements (in particular Besluit
modellen jaarrekening) and as a result of re-evaluation of the accounting policy regarding the
classification of costs as other operating expenses. The following adjustments are made:

**BALANCE SHEET**

Amount 2020 in

Item (x €1,000) 2020 2021 Difference

Non-current receivables and prepayments 28,566 13,844 14,722

Other operating expenses -306,320 -6,990 299,330


-----

**2.4 Foreign currencies**
_Functional currency_
Items included in the financial statements of group companies are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective group company
operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented
in Euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of Boels Topholding B.V.

_Transactions, receivables and debts_
Foreign currency transactions in the reporting period are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from
the translation at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement.

_Group companies_
Assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency different from
the presentation currency are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Income and expense are translated at average exchange rates during the financial
year. Any resulting exchange differences are processed directly to the legal reserve for
translation differences within equity.

The following exchange rates have been used to prepare the financial statements:

(x €1,000) 31 December 2021 2021

EUR : CZK 1 : 24.86 1 : 26.24

EUR : PLN 1 : 4.60 1 : 4.56

EUR : HUF 1 : 369.19 1 : 363.89

EUR : CHF 1 : 1.03 1 : 1.08

EUR : DKK 1 : 7.44 1 : 7.44

EUR : NOK 1 : 9.99 1 : 10.47

EUR : SEK 1 : 10.25 1 : 10.03

EUR : GBP 1 : 0.84 1 : 0.90


**2.5 Intangible assets**
Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less amortisation. Allowance is made for any
impairment losses expected. A loss qualifies as an impairment loss if the carrying amount of
the asset (or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs) exceeds its recoverable amount.

For details on how to determine whether an intangible asset has to be impaired, please refer
to note 2.8 below.

_Goodwill_
Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated
future useful life.

Goodwill is amortised in 5 to 10 years and is dependent on the expected useful life. The useful
life concerned is dependent on multiple factors such as plans for integration in the Boels
organisation, the market position of the acquired company and the expected duration of the
economic benefits. The CRAMO goodwill is amortized over 10 years given CRAMO’s market
position, the expected economic benefits and CRAMO Group is acting as a relative standalone
group within the Boels organization.
The estimated future useful life of goodwill of small acquisitions is most often 5 years, as
corresponding depots will be relatively quickly be fully integrated into the Boels operations.
At acquired smaller companies, the staff turnover is often high. For this reason the initial
estimated useful life of goodwill has an economic life of 10 years (and in most cases a maximum
of 5 years).

_Brand name_
The Brand name ‘CRAMO’ is acquired during the acquisition of CRAMO in 2020. The brand name
has been measured during the purchase price allocation applying the relief- of-royalty method.
The estimated useful life of the brand name ‘CRAMO’ is estimated on 10 years and accordingly
amortised on a straight line basis.

_Other intangible assets - Customer Contracts_
In business combinations part of the purchase price has been allocated to customer contracts.
Initial measurement of these customer contracts applying the Multi-period Excess Earnings
Method and the forecasted revenues and profits related to these contracts. The amortization
period is 5 year.


-----

**2.6 Property, plant and equipment**
Land and buildings are stated at historical cost plus expenditure that is directly attributable to
the acquisition of the items, less straight line depreciation over their estimated future useful
lives. Land is not depreciated. An allowance is made for any impairment losses expected on
the balance sheet date. For details on how to determine whether property, plant or equipment
is impaired, please refer to note 2.8 below.

Other non-current assets are valued at historical cost, less straight line depreciation over
their estimated useful lives and impairment losses. The manufacturing price is comprised of
the cost of raw materials and consumables and also includes expenditure directly attributable
to an asset’s manufacturing, including installation costs.

No provision for major future repairs to buildings or machinery and equipment has been
formed. Major repairs extending the estimated future useful lives are capitalized. in
accordance with the component approach. Other repairs are recognized as expenses.

**2.7 Financial assets**
_Associates_
Group companies and other associates in which the Company exercises significant influence,
generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% or more of the voting rights, are stated at net
asset value.

Net asset value is calculated using the accounting policies applied in these financial
statements. Associates with an equity deficit are valued at nil. A provision is formed if and
when Boels Topholding B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the associate, or has
the firm intention to allow the associate to pay its debts.

Associates acquired are initially measured at the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities upon acquisition. Any subsequent valuation is based on the accounting policies that
apply to these financial statements, taking into account the initial valuation.

Associates in which no significant influence can be exercised are recognised at cost.

_Loans to participants and other loans_
Upon initial recognition the loans to participants are valued at fair value and then valued
at amortised cost, after deduction of any provisions. These provisions are determined by
individual assessment of the receivables.


_Deferred tax assets_
Deferred tax assets are stated under the financial assets if and to the extent it is probable that
the tax claim can be realised in due course. These deferred tax assets are valued at nominal
value and have a predominantly long-term character.

**2.8 Impairment of non-current assets**
At each balance sheet date, the Company tests whether there are any indications of assets
being subject to impairment. If any such indications exist, the recoverable amount of the asset
is determined. If this proves to be impossible, the recoverable amount of the cash generating
unit to which the asset belongs is identified. An asset is subject to impairment, if its carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on the active market. An impairment loss
is directly expensed in the income statement.

If it is established that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer applies or has
declined, the increased carrying amount of the assets in question is not set any higher than
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no asset impairment been
recognised. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.

Management assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the
impairment loss is determined and recognised in the income statement.

**2.9 Inventories**
Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of replacement value, i.e. purchase
price at the balance sheet date and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in,
first out (FIFO) method.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
applicable variable selling expenses. Net realisable value is determined making allowance
for obsolescence of inventories.

**2.10 Receivables**
Trade receivables are recognised at cost, which is the fair value at moment of sale. When
a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade


-----

**2.11 Cash**
Cash includes cash in hand, bank balances and deposits held at call with maturities of less than
12 months. Bank overdrafts are shown within loans in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Cash is stated at face value.

**2.12 Minority interest**
Minority interests in group equity are stated at the amount of the net interest in the net assets
of group companies concerned.

**2.13 Provisions**
_General information_
Provisions are recognised for legally enforceable or constructive obligations existing at
the balance sheet date, the settlement of which is probable to require an outflow of resources
whose extent can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured based on the best estimate
of the amounts required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date. Unless indicated
otherwise, provisions are stated at the nominal value of the expenditure expected to be
required to settle the obligations.

_Deferred income tax assets and liabilities_
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised to provide for temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the financial
statements (i.e. property, plant and equipment and fair value adjustments on acquisitions).
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income taxes are recognised at face value.

_Pension benefits management board_
At the 23rd of December 2019, the management board converted the self-administrated
defined benefit pension plan to a fiscal old-age reserve (FOR).

This means that as per the 23rd of December 2019, the defined benefit pension plan was
stamped to its fiscal balance sheet value. The new fiscal old-age reserve, which compounds
annually at the average U-return published by the Dutch Tax Authority, is presented in the
balance sheet and corresponds with the present fiscal value. Since this date the reserve is
presented as a long term liability.


_Pension benefits employees_
For the employees, the group operates a defined contribution plan.
For this plan, Boels Topholding B.V. pays contributions to pension funds and insurance
companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying contributions, Boels Topholding B.V.
has no other obligations to pay further contributions by virtue of these pension plans.
No provision is made for probable future increase of premium. Contributions are recognised
as expenses when incurred. The employees bear the actuarial and investment risk. Prepaid
contributions are recognised as prepayments and accrued income to the extent that this will
lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
Of the foreign group companies of Boels Topholding B.V. only Boels Rental Germany GmbH
has an own pension plan which is an the result of an pension arrangement from the past that
is applicable for a specific group of former CRAMO AG employees. This plan classifies as a
defined benefit plan. The obligation includes the present value of the expenditures that are
probably required to settle. The present value factor is the market rate of interest of highquality corporate bonds. If the obligation is due within a year, the obligation is not discounted.
Additions and withdrawals from the pension provision are taken into the profit and loss account.

_Jubilee benefits_
The provision for jubilee benefits is measured at the present value of expected benefits
payable during employment. The calculation of the provision, takes the expected future salary
increases, the likelihood that employees stay at the company and actuarial discount rate of 1%
into account.

_Other provisions_
As the effect of the time value of money is not material, the other provisions are valued at face
value.

**2.14 Non-current and current liabilities**
Upon initial recognition, the loans and liabilities recorded are stated at fair value and then
valued at amortised cost.

_Finance lease_
A lease is classified as finance lease, if the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are borne
wholly or almost wholly by the group as lessee. At the commencement date of the finance
lease term, the lease object and the related liability are recognised at amounts equal to the fair
value of the leased object or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The discount rate used in calculating the present value is the interest rate implicit in the lease. i


-----

During the lease term interest charges are allocated so as to produce a constant periodic rate
of interest for each period. Relevant assets are depreciated over the remaining useful life.

Leases that do not classify as finance lease, classify as operating lease. For operating leases,
lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**2.15 Financial instruments**
_Primary financial instruments_
The accounting policies for receivables and liabilities have been stated separately.

_Financial derivatives_
Boels Topholding B.V. is making use of financial derivatives to cover the exposure to interest
risks and foreign exchange risks.

Financial derivatives are carried at cost or lower fair value. If the fair value at balance sheet
date is negative, this is reflected as a liability in the balance sheet.

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.

Changes in the book value of these derivative instruments are recognised directly in the
income statement.

The group does not apply hedge accounting.

**3** **Accounting policies for the income statement**

-----

**3.8 Amortisation and depreciation**

depreciated over their estimated useful lives as from the inception of their use. Land is not
depreciated. Future depreciation and amortisation is adjusted if there is a change in estimated
future useful life.

Gains and losses on sales of land and buildings are presented as other income. The book value
of machinery and equipment sold are recognised as a component of cost of sold equipment/
sales products.

**3.9 Employee benefits**

terms of employment.

_Pensions_
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for their employees.

the applicable tax rates.

**4** **Financial instruments and risk management**
**4.1 Price risk**
_Currency risk_
Boels Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash flows generated in
Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and the Czech Republic. Boels Topholding B.V.
also incurs currency risk on the net investment in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary,
Czech Republic, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Management has determined, based on a risk assessment, that some of these currency risks
need to be hedged. This policy is intended to protect the operational margin as well as
the balance sheet position. Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose.

At December 31, 2021 forward exchange contracts are outstanding with a nominal value
of € 118.5 million. The group does not apply hedge accounting.

_Interest rate and cash flow risk_
The Company incurs interest rate risk on interest bearing non-current and current liabilities,
including loans.

It is the policy of the Company to have a fixed/floating interest rate profile on the interest
bearing liabilities which is fitting with the nature of the Company’s assets. As most of the
interest bearing liabilities have a floating interest rate, Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted
interest rate swaps so that it receives floating interest and pays fixed interest. This policy is
determined to obtain a desired risk profile in fixed and variable interest positions.

At 31 December 2021 interest rate swaps have been concluded for a nominal amount of € 900m
(31-12-2020: € 180m), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of these interest
rate swaps amount to € 6,288k (31-12-2020: € 8,989k negative).


-----

These interest rate swaps were entered into in February 2021 for a total amount of € 900m.
These transactions are 1 year forward starting and have a term until February 2026.
They have an average fixed rate of 0.174% and include a floor at 0%.

**4.2 Credit risk**
Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk, this as
a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on account are only made to
customers that meet the Company’s credit rating requirements. Goods and services are sold
subject to payment terms, the majority ranging between 15 till 60 days. A different payment
period may apply to major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded,
including guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits and
payment terms per customer. Financial receivables like cash in banks and derivative financial
instruments are held with reputable banks with a solid credit rating.

**4.3 Liquidity risk**
On June 29, 2021 the company has successfully concluded a repricing of its existing 7 years
syndicated debt facility agreement. After the repricing, this agreement consisted of the
following facilities:

- a € 1,450.0 million Term Loan B, maturing in 2027;

- a € 179.3 million Revolving Credit Facility, maturing in 2026.

The loan agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, typical to such
agreements, primarily related to the leverage for the group as a whole. The group calculated
various scenarios. Based on these scenarios management is comfortable with the compliance
of the agreed covenants and with the liquidity for the group as a whole.

##### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the shareholders of Boels Topholding B.V.

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 INCLUDED IN**
**THE ANNUAL REPORT**

**Our opinion**
We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2021 of Boels Topholding B.V.,
based in Sittard.
In our opinion the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of Boels Topholding B.V. as at 31 December 2021, and of its result for 2021
in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The financial statements comprise:
1. The consolidated and company balance sheet as at 31 December 2021.
2. The consolidated and company income statement for 2021.
3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

**Basis for our opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards
on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
“Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.

We are independent of Boels Topholding B.V. in accordance with the Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

**Information in support of our opinion**
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion
was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on
these matters.


**Audit approach fraud risks**
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements
due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment
and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment
process and management’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the
system of internal control and how the Board of Directors exercises oversight, as well as the
outcomes. We reported to the Board of Directors the company has not formalized its fraud risk
assessment and fraud management strategy.

We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control, including
internal fraud & integrity protocols and incident registration. We evaluated the design and
the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness,
of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As part of our process of identifying
fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud,
misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic
specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement
due to fraud is present.

We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures:

_•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to management override of controls:_
We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud as management is in a unique
position to perpetrate fraud because of management’s assumed ability to manipulate
accounting records by overriding controls and include intentional bias in estimates
affecting the financial statements. We have pinpointed the possible incentives of
management on meeting the loan covenants and the long term and yearly bonus plan
for the strategic board members. In this respect EBITDA serves as the key performance
indicator for the entity and management.

_•_ _Risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition:_
We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud related to revenue recognition.
This risk relates to the occurrence and correct period cut-off of revenues for nonstandard rental revenue transactions.

To respond to these fraud risks we performed the following procedures:

- We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives from the
strategic board, directors, finance employees, risk manager and the general counsel.

- We tested the appropriateness and business rationale of journal entries recorded in
the general ledger and other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial


-----

- We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group,
particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be
indicative of fraudulent financial reporting.

- We evaluated all internally registered fraud instances in financial year 2021 and evaluated
of management’s follow up is appropriate.

- For significant transactions such as refinancing and restructuring we evaluated whether
the business rationale of the transactions suggests that they may have been entered into
to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to conceal misappropriation of assets.

- We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the
accounting estimates included in the financial statements indicate a possible bias that
may reflect a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, estimates
and assumptions that have a major impact on the financial statements are disclosed
in note 1.7 of the financial statements. We also performed a retrospective review of
management judgments and assumptions related to material accounting estimates
reflected in prior year financial statement, such as the depreciation rates, valuation and
impairment triggers of intangible and tangible assets.

- We have performed extensive sampling testing on revenue postings not orginating from
the rental system and performed extensive procedures to determine appropriate period
cut-off of the revenue in the financial statements.

- We have included fraud as a specific focus area in the group instructions to the
component audit teams and have conducted site visits on a number of business locations
to Sweden and Finland.

- We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the
outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were
indicative of fraud or noncompliance.

Our audit procedures for the year as specified in this paragraph did not lead to indications for
fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.

**Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations**
We differentiate our audit approach between two categories

- Rules and regulations that directly impact the financial reporting

- Rules and regulations that indirectly may have material impact on the financial
statements

In the first category, we considered adherence to (corporate)tax law and financial reporting
regulations including the requirements under Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. These i


In the second category, we considered other laws and regulations where the consequences
of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the
financial statements, for instance, through imposed fines or litigation. This category includes
regulations related to the act on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of
Terrorism (‘WWFT’).

Our procedures are more limited with respect to laws and regulations that do not have a direct
effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may however be fundamental to the operating
aspects of the business, to Boels Topholding B.V.’s ability to continue its business, or to avoid
material penalties and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a
material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility for these matters that indirectly
impact the financial statement is limited to:
(i) inquiry of the Board of Directors, the risk manager, legal counsel and others within the
Company as to whether the Company is in compliance with such laws and regulations, and
(ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities
to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material
effect on the financial statements.
(iii) request and obtain written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud
or non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. We remained
alert to indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.

**Audit approach going concern**
Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of management, are outlined under the
prevailing standards in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements”
section below. Management has assessed the going concern assumption, as part of the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that no events or
conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, give rise to doubt about the ability of the group
to continue in operation of at least twelve months after the date of the financial statements.
We have obtained management’s assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern, and have assessed the going concern assumption applied. As part of our procedures,
we evaluated whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained regarding,
and have concluded on, the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis
of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Based on these
procedures, we did not identify any reportable findings related to the entity’s ability to continue
as a going concern.


-----

**Emphasis on the impact of the Russia/Ukraine-Crisis**
The Russia/Ukraine-Crisis also impacts Boels Topholding B.V. Management disclosed the
estimated impact on financial performance and health of Boels Topholding B.V. and her
plans to deal with these events or circumstances in paragraph 2.2, page 22 of the financial
statements. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**REPORT ON THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT**

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report
contain other information that consists of:

- Board of Directors’ report.

- Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

- Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements.

- Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained
through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the
other information contains material misstatements.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the report
from the Board of Directors in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and
the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the financial statements**
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the
Board of Directors is responsible for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines i


As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible
for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting framework mentioned, the Board of Directors should prepare the financial
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.

The Board of Directors should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we
may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on
our opinion.

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements
and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.


-----

 - Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue
as a going concern.

 - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures.

 - Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing,
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information
or specific items.

We communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal
control that we identified during our audit.

-----

### 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE BALANCE SHEET

#### 2.1 GENERAL INFORMATION

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2, of the

Dutch Civil Code and the firm pronouncements in the Guidelines

for Annual Reporting in the Netherlands as issued by the Dutch

Accounting Standards Board.

In general, assets and liabilities are stated at the amounts at which

they were acquired or incurred, or current value. If not specifically

stated otherwise, they are recognised at the amounts at which they

were acquired or incurred. The balance sheet, income statement and

cash flow statement include references to the notes.

#### 2.2 PRIOR-YEAR COMPARISON

The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the

years presented. The presentation of some prior year balance sheet

items has been changed in comparison to last years’ annual accounts

for clarification purposes.

#### 2.3 FOREIGN CURRENCIES

**Functional currency**

Items included in the financial statements of group companies are

measured using the currency of the primary economic environment

in which the respective group company operates (the functional

currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in

Euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of Boels

Topholding B.V.

**Transactions, receivables and debts**

Foreign currency transactions in the reporting period are translated

into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at

the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies

are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange

prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and

losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from

the translation at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the

income statement.


**Group companies**

Assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries with a functional

currency different from the presentation currency are translated at

the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income

and expense are translated at average exchange rates during the

financial year. Any resulting exchange differences are processed

directly to the legal reserve for translation differences within equity.

The following exchange rates have been used to prepare the financial

statements:

(x 1,000) **31 December 2020** **2020**

EUR : CZK 1: 26.24 1:26.46

EUR : PLN 1:4.56 1:4.44

EUR : HUF 1:363.89 1:351.25

EUR : CHF 1:1.08 1:1.07

EUR : DKK 1:7.44 1:7.45

EUR : NOK 1:10.47 1:10.72

EUR : SEK 1:10.03 1:10.48

EUR : GBP 1:0.90 1:0.89

#### 2.4 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less amortisation.

Allowance is made for any impairment losses expected. A loss

qualifies as an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset

(or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs) exceeds its

recoverable amount.

For details on how to determine whether an intangible asset has to

be impaired, please refer to note 2.7 below.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight

line basis over its estimated future useful life.

Goodwill is amortised in 5 to 10 years and is dependent on the expected

useful life. The useful life concerned is dependent on multiple factors

such as plans for integration in the Boels organisation, the market

position of the acquired company and the expected duration of the

economic benefits. The Cramo goodwill is amortized over 10 years

given Cramo’s market position, the expected economic benefits and

Cramo Group is acting as a relative standalone group within the

Boels organization.


-----

The estimated future useful life of goodwill of acquired smaller

companies is most often 5 years and as corresponding depots will be

relatively short as of these smaller entities will be fully integrated into

the Boels operations in a few year. At acquired smaller companies,

the staff turnover is often high. For this reason the initial estimated

useful life of goodwill has an economic life of 10 years (and in most

cases a maximum of 5 years).

**Brand name**

The Brand name “Cramo” is acquired during the acquisition of Cramo

in 2020. The brand name has been measured during the purchase

price allocation applying the relief-of-royalty method. The estimated

useful life of the brand name “Cramo” is estimated on 10 years and

accordingly amortised on a straight line basis.

**Customer Contracts**

In business combinations part of the purchase price has been

allocated to customer contracts. Initial measurement of these

customer contracts applying the Multi-period Excess Earnings

Method and the forecasted revenues and profits related to these

contracts. The amortization period is 5 year.

#### 2.5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Land and buildings are stated at historical cost plus expenditure that

is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items, less straight

line depreciation over their estimated future useful lives. Land is

not depreciated. An allowance is made for any impairment losses

expected on the balance sheet date. For details on how to determine

whether property, plant or equipment is impaired, please refer to

note 2.7 below.

Other non-current assets are valued at historical cost, less straight

line depreciation over their estimated useful lives and impairment

losses. The manufacturing price is comprised of the cost of raw

materials and consumables and also includes expenditure directly

attributable to an asset’s manufacturing, including installation costs.

No provision for major future repairs to buildings or machinery and

equipment has been formed. Major repairs extending the estimated

future useful lives are capitalized. in accordance with the component

approach. Other repairs are recognized as expenses.


#### 2.6 FINANCIAL ASSETS

**Associates**

Group companies and other associates in which the Company exercises

significant influence, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% or

more of the voting rights, are stated at net asset value.

Net asset value is calculated using the accounting policies applied

in these financial statements. Associates with an equity deficit are

valued at nil. A provision is formed if and when Boels Topholding B.V.

is fully or partially liable for the debts of the associate, or has the firm

intention to allow the associate to pay its debts.

Associates acquired are initially measured at the fair value of the

identifiable assets and liabilities upon acquisition. Any subsequent

valuation is based on the accounting policies that apply to these

financial statements, taking into account the initial valuation.

Associates in which no significant influence can be exercised are

recognised at cost.

**Loans to participants and other loans**

The loans to participants are carried at cost, which usually equals

face value. If the recoverable amount at balance sheet date is lower

than its book value, a provision is made.

#### 2.7 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS

At each balance sheet date, the Company tests whether there are

any indications of assets being subject to impairment. If any such

indications exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined.

If this proves to be impossible, the recoverable amount of the cash

generating unit to which the asset belongs is identified. An asset is

subject to impairment, if its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable

amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value

less costs to sell and value in use.

Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on the active market.

An impairment loss is directly expensed in the income statement.


-----

If it is established that a previously recognised impairment loss no

longer applies or has declined, the increased carrying amount of the

assets in question is not set any higher than the carrying amount

that would have been determined had no asset impairment been

recognised. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.

Management assesses at each balance sheet date whether there

is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial

assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the impairment loss

is determined and recognised in the income statement.

#### 2.8 INVENTORIES

Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of replacement

value, i.e. purchase price at the balance sheet date and net realisable

value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course

of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Net realisable

value is determined making allowance for obsolescence of inventories.

#### 2.9 RECEIVABLES

Trade receivables are recognised at cost, which is the fair value at

moment of sale. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written

off against the allowance account for trade receivables.

#### 2.10 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank balances and

deposits held at call with maturities of less than 12 months. Bank

overdrafts are shown within loans in current liabilities on the balance

sheet. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at face value.

#### 2.11 MINORITY INTEREST

Minority interests in group equity are stated at the amount of the net

interest in the net assets of group companies concerned.

#### 2.12 PROVISIONS

**General information**

Provisions are recognised for legally enforceable or constructive

obligations existing at the balance sheet date, the settlement of

which is probable to require an outflow of resources whose extent

can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured based on the

best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligations at the

balance sheet date. Unless indicated otherwise, provisions are stated


at the nominal value of the expenditure expected to be required to

settle the obligations.

**Deferred income tax assets and liabilities**

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised to provide

for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and

liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the financial statements

(i.e. property, plant and equipment and fair value adjustments on

acquisitions). Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that

have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet

date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax

asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income taxes are recognised at face value.

**Pension benefits management board**

At the 23rd of December 2019, the management board converted the

self-administrated defined benefit pension plan to a fiscal old-age

reserve (FOR).

This means that as per the 23rd of December 2019, the defined

benefit pension plan was stamped to its fiscal balance sheet value.

The new fiscal old-age reserve, which compounds annually at the

average U-return published by the Dutch Tax Authority, is presented

in the balance sheet and corresponds with the present fiscal value.

Since this date the reserve is presented as a long term liability.

**Pension benefits employees**

For the employees, the group operates a defined contribution plan.

For this plan, Boels Topholding B.V. pays contributions to pension funds

and insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying

contributions, Boels Topholding B.V. has no other obligations to pay

further contributions by virtue of these pension plans. No provision

is made for probable future increase of premium. Contributions are

recognised as expenses when incurred. Prepaid contributions are

recognised as prepayments and accrued income to the extent that

this will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

Of the foreign group companies of Boels Topholding B.V. only Cramo

AG has an own pension plan which is an the result of an pension

arrangement from the past that is applicable for a specific group of

former Cramo AG employees. This plan classifies as a defined benefit

plan. The obligation includes the present value of the expenditures

that are probably required to settle. The present value factor is


-----

the market rate of interest of high-quality corporate bonds. If the

obligation is due within a year, the obligation is not discounted.

Additions and withdrawals from the pension provision are taken into

the profit and loss account.

**Jubilee benefits**

The provision for jubilee benefits is measured at the present value of

expected benefits payable during employment. The calculation of the

provision, takes the expected future salary increases, the likelihood

that employees stay at the company and actuarial discount rate of

4% into account.

**Other provisions**

The other provisions are recognised at face value.

#### 2.13 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

**Primary financial instruments**

The accounting policies for receivables and liabilities have been

stated separately.

**Financial derivatives**

Boels Topholding B.V. is making use of financial derivatives to cover

the exposure to interest risks and foreign exchange risks.

Financial derivatives are carried at cost, which usually equals face

value. If the fair value at balance sheet date is lower than its book

value, a provision is made.

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or

a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s

length transaction. This fair value is annually determined by the

counter contract partner (banks).

Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are

recognised directly in the income statement.


### 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE INCOME STATEMENT

#### 3.1 GENERAL INFORMATION

Profit or loss is determined as the difference between the realisable

value of the goods delivered and services rendered, and the costs and

other charges for the year. Revenues on transactions are recognised in

the year in which they are realised.

Profit or loss is determined, taking into account the recognition of

unrealised changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not

designated as hedges.

The profit and loss account states a separate item named ‘cost of

sales’. This presentation is a deviation from the applicable standard but

is justified under reference to Article 363 of the Dutch Civil Code.

#### 3.2 REVENUE RECOGNITION

**Sales of renting and services**

Revenue from sales of renting and services is recognised based on the

renting and services delivered to the customer till the balance sheet

date. The rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis during

the rental period.

**Sales of goods**

Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when all significant risks

and rewards incidental to the ownership of the goods have been

transferred to the buyer.

#### 3.3 EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES

Exchange differences arising upon the settlement or conversion of

monetary items are recognised in the income statement in the period

that they arise, unless they are hedged.

#### 3.4 REVENUE

Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or

receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course

of the Company’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax,

rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group.


-----

#### 3.5 COST OF SALES

Cost of sales represents the direct and indirect expenses attributable

to revenue, including raw materials and consumables, cost of work

contracted out, other external expenses, and other operating expenses

that are attributable to cost of sales. The book value of machinery and

equipment sold are recognised as a component of cost of sales.

#### 3.6 AMORTISATION AND DEPRECIATION

Intangible assets, including goodwill, are amortised and property, plant

and equipment depreciated over their estimated useful lives as from

the inception of their use. Land is not depreciated. Future depreciation

and amortisation is adjusted if there is a change in estimated future

useful life.

Gains and losses on sales of land and buildings are presented as

other income. The book value of machinery and equipment sold are

recognised as a component of cost of sales.

#### 3.7 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

**Short-term employee benefits**

Salaries, wages and social security contributions are recognised as

expenses based on the terms of employment.

**Pensions**

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for their employees.

For its defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to

pension funds and insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except

for paying contributions, Boels Topholding B.V. has no other obligations to

pay further contributions by virtue of these pension plans. Contributions

are recognised as expenses when incurred. Prepaid contributions are

recognised as prepayments and accrued income to the extent that this

will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

#### 3.8 FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS

**Interest paid and received**

Interest paid and received is recognised on a time-weighted basis.

**Changes in financial instruments value below cost**

Changes in the value of the financial derivatives below cost are

recognised directly through profit or loss.


#### 3.9 INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax is calculated on the profit or loss before tax in the income

statement, taking into account any losses carried forward from previous

financial years (where not included in deferred income tax assets),

tax exempt items and plus non deductible expenses. Account is also

taken of changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities owing to

changes in the applicable tax rates.

### 4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

#### 4.1 PRICE RISK

**Currency risk**

Boels Topholding B.V. mainly operates in the European Union. Boels

Topholding B.V. is exposed to currency risk mainly from its cash

flows generated in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Poland and

the Czech Republic. Management has determined, based on a risk

assessment, that some of these currency risks need to be hedged (cash

flow hedging). This policy is intended to protect the operational margin.

Forward exchange contracts are used for this purpose.

At December 31, 2020 forward exchange contracts (EURSEK and

EURNOK) are outstanding with a nominal value of EUR 129.3 million.

Boels Topholding B.V. also incurs currency risk on the net investment

in the operations in Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic,

Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. Due to the

size of this currency risk, apart from the net investment in Sweden, no

actions have been undertaken.

**Interest rate and cash flow risk**

The Company incurs interest rate risk on interest bearing non-current

and current liabilities, including loans.

Boels Topholding B.V. has contracted interest rate swaps for its variable

interest liabilities (loans), so that it receives floating interest and pays

fixed interest. This policy is determined to obtain a desired risk profile in

fixed and variable interest positions.

To determine the amounts and duration of financial derivatives the

Company monitors the interest balance. On the debit side of the interest

balance, the assets which need to be covered are mentioned. On the


-----

credit side of the balance the equity, provisions and concluded interest

derivatives are mentioned.

To cover interest risks at 31 December 2020 interest rate swaps have

been concluded for a nominal amount of € 180 million (31-12-2019:

€ 180 million), with a duration of less than 5 years. The market value of

these interest rate swaps amount to € 8,989k negative (31-12-2019: €

8,718k negative).

In February 2021 we’ve closed out our existing interest rate swaps,

amounting to € 180 million against € 8.4 million cash settlement.

Subsequently we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with

ABN-Amro, BNP, ING and Rabobank for a total amount of € 900 million.

These transactions are 1 year forward starting and have a term until

February 2026. They have an average rate of 0.174% and include a floor

at 0%.

#### 4.2 CREDIT RISK

Boels Topholding B.V. does not have any significant concentrations of credit

risk, this as a result of the spread customers, markets and region. Sales on

account are only made to customers that meet the Company’s credit rating.

Goods and services are sold subject to payment deadlines, the majority

ranging between 15 till 60 days. A different payment period may apply to

major supplies, in which case additional securities are demanded, including

guarantees. Credit risks are constantly monitored by reviewing credit limits

and payment terms per customer.

#### 4.3 LIQUIDITY RISK

On February 6, 2020 the company has successfully concluded a

7 years syndicate facility agreement with a banking consortium.

Subsequent to the Cramo acquisition this financing arrangement has

been amended and syndicated to the market by the end of June 2020.

After amendment, this agreement consisted of the following facilities:

- a € 1.335 million Term Loan B with a term of 7 years;

- a € 275.5 million amortizing (5%) Loan A with a term of 6.5 years;

- a € 200 million Revolving Credit Facility with a term of 6.5 years,

the purpose of this facility is to finance working capital and capital

expenditures.

The loan agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants,

typical to such agreements, primarily related to the leverage for


the group as a whole. The group calculated various scenarios also

taking into account the Covid-19 situation. Based on these scenarios

management is comfortable with the compliance of the agreed

covenants and liquidity for the group as a whole.

At the end of March 2020 all existing finance agreements which

consisted of an unsecured credit facility agreement with a total credit

line of € 210 million and an unsecured financing in amount of € 413,5

million via the German Schuldschein Darlehen market, have been

repaid in advanced.

### 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

**Interest Hedging**

In February 2021 we’ve closed out our existing interest rate swaps,

amounting to EUR 180 million against EUR 8.4 million cash settlement.

Subsequently we entered into new interest rate swap agreements

with ABN-Amro, BNP, ING and Rabobank for a total amount of

EUR 900 million. These transactions are 1 year forward starting

and have a term until February 2026. They have an average rate of

0.174% and include a floor at 0%.

Covid-19

During the first months of 2021 Covid-19 continues to impact

the economies in Europe and government measures are in place

to prevent the further spread of the virus. Although government

measures are still in place at the authorized for issue date of

these financial statements, the group is able to continue its regular

operations. Given the uncertainty involved, management is unable to

predict the exact impact of Covid-19 on its business in the upcoming

year as future currently unknown events could influence the business

activities.

# 3.2 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the shareholders of Boels Topholding B.V.

#### A. REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL REPORT

**Our opinion**

We have audited the financial statements 2020 of Boels Topholding

B.V. based in Sittard.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true

and fair view of the financial position of Boels Topholding B.V. as at

31 December 2020, and of its result for 2020 in accordance with Part

9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

The financial statements comprise:

1. the consolidated and company balance sheet as at 31 December

2020;

2. the consolidated and company profit and loss account for 2020;

and

3. the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and

other explanatory information.

**Basis for our opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the

Dutch Standards on Auditing.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in

the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’

section of our report.

We are independent of Boels Topholding B.V. in accordance with the

‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision

act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants

bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional

Auditors, a regulation with respect to independence) and other

relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore

we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels

accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).


We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

#### B. REPORT ON THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL REPORT

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report

thereon, the financial report 2020 contains other information that

consists of:

- The directors’ report;

- Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch

Civil Code.

Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the

other information:

- is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain

material misstatements;

- contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the

Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and

understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements

or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information

contains material misstatements.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of

Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720.

The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the

scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

Management is responsible for the preparation of the directors’

report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code

and other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch

Civil Code.


-----

#### C. DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
 REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Responsibilities of management for the financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation

of the financial statements in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of

the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for

such internal control as management determines is necessary to

enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management

is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue

as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework

mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements

using the going concern basis of accounting unless management

either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has

no realistic alternative but to do so.

Management should disclose events and circumstances that may

cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going

concern in the financial statements.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner

that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for

our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of

assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and

fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on

the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the

nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation

of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.


We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained

professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with

Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence

requirements. Our audit included among others.:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of

the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing

and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks,

and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a

material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control;

- Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the

audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in

the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an

opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control;

- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and

the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related

disclosures made by management;

- Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the

going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related

to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the

company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related

disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on

the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.

However, future events or conditions may cause a company to

cease to continue as a going concern;

- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the

financial statements, including the disclosures; and

- Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves

fair presentation.


-----

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also

responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit.

In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit

procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the

size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On

this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review

had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or

specific items.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding,

among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and

significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal

control that we identify during our audit.
