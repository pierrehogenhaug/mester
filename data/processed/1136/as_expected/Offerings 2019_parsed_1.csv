These non-GAAP Measures, as well as other statistical measures, including Credit Agreement EBITDA (as defined herein), and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) are presented because management believes these measures provide additional information regarding the Company’s performance and the Issuer’s ability to service debt, and because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. In addition, management believes that these measures are useful to assess the Company’s operating performance trends because they exclude certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future, and certain other items. The non-GAAP Measures are not presented in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s computation of these non-GAAP Measures may vary from those used by other companies.

We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP Measures by relying primarily on our financial measures derived in accordance with GAAP and using Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only for supplemental purposes. The presentation of Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

In addition, we believe favorable industry trends such as an aging population and advancements in medical technology will further drive growth.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Operations,9.3.1,Surgical Facility Services Segment,"_Surgical Facility Operations_ As of December 31, 2018, we owned (primarily with physician investors or healthcare systems) or operated 123 surgical facilities, including 15 licensed hospitals. Our surgical facility services segment contributed approximately 95%, 93% and 91% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our typical ASC is a free-standing facility that performs planned surgical procedures on an outpatient basis for patients not requiring hospitalization and for whom an overnight stay is not expected after surgery. Each center typically has one to four operating or procedure rooms with areas for reception, pre-operative care, recovery and administration. The staff of our ASCs generally includes a center administrator, registered nurses, operating room technicians, as well as other administrative staff. Our surgical hospitals are generally larger than our ASCs and include inpatient hospital rooms and, in two cases, a limited scope emergency department. Our surgical hospitals also provide ancillary services such as diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, laboratory, obstetrics, physical therapy, oncology and wound care. We operate both multi-specialty and single-specialty facilities. In multi-specialty facilities, a variety of surgical procedures are performed, including, among others, gastroenterology, general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics and pain management. We have diversified the mix of procedures performed at our facilities by strategically introducing select specialties that will complement existing facilities. In many cases, we keep certain facilities as single-specialty where it suits an individual facility or market demand. Our surgical facilities are generally located in close proximity to physicians’ offices. We provide each of our surgical facilities with a full range of financial, marketing and operating services. For example, our regional managed care directors assist the local management team at each of our surgical facilities in developing relationships with managed care providers and negotiating managed care contracts. _Surgical Facility Ownership Structure_ We own and operate our surgical facilities through partnerships or limited liability companies with physicians, physician groups and healthcare systems. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries typically serves as the general partner or managing member of our surgical facilities. We generally seek to own a majority interest in our surgical facilities, or otherwise have sufficient control over the facilities to be able to consolidate the financial results of operations of the facilities with ours. In some instances, we will acquire ownership in a surgical facility with the prior owners retaining ownership, and, in some cases, we offer new ownership to other physicians or healthcare systems. We hold majority ownership in 84 of the 123 surgical facilities in which we own an interest. We provide intercompany loans to some of the surgical facilities which often are secured by a pledge of assets of the facility. We also have a management agreement with the majority of our surgical facilities, under which we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee, which is typically equal to a percentage of the facility revenue. _Strategic Relationships_ When attractive opportunities arise, we may develop, acquire or operate surgical facilities through strategic relationships with payors, healthcare systems, and other healthcare providers. We believe that forming such relationships can enhance our ability to attract physicians and access favorable managed care contracts for our surgical facilities in that market. The strategic relationships through which we own and operate surgical facilities are governed by partnership and operating agreements that are generally comparable to the partnership and operating agreements of the other surgical facilities in which we own an interest. The primary difference between the structure of these strategic relationships and the other surgical facilities in which we hold ownership is that, in these strategic relationships, a healthcare system holds ownership in the surgical facility, in addition to physician investors. In each of these strategic relationships, we also have entered into a management agreement under which we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee equal to a percentage of the revenues of 2 ----- the surgical facility. The terms of those management agreements are comparable to the terms of our management agreements with other surgical facilities in which we own an interest. _Sources of Revenue_ Revenue from our surgical facilities is earned from facility fees related to healthcare services performed in our surgical facilities and is included in our patient service revenues. The fee charged for surgical services varies depending on the type of service provided, but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room, a recovery room, special equipment, supplies, nursing staff and/or medications. Our fees do not typically include professional fees charged by the patient’s surgeon, anesthesiologist or other attending physician, which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third-party payor. We are dependent upon private and government third-party sources of payment for the surgical services we provide. The amounts that our surgical facilities receive in payment for their services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations as well as cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third-party payors.

1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,"Year Ended December 31, 2018** **2017** **2016",9.4.1,Ancillary Services and Optical Services Segments,"_Ancillary Services_ Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented by a suite of ancillary services, which support our physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient patient care. Rather than contracting with thirdparty providers, in some geographies we own ancillary businesses including a diagnostic laboratory, multispecialty physician practices, urgent care facilities and anesthesia services. Our Company, physicians and patients benefit from these services through improved clinical efficiency and scheduling, and from incremental revenue associated with retaining these fees. Our ancillary services segment contributed 4 ----- approximately 4%, 6% and 8% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ancillary services includes a diagnostic laboratory and multi-specialty physician practices. � We offer physicians toxicology testing services through our wholly-owned diagnostic laboratory, based in Tampa, Florida. Advanced toxicology screening provides physicians with the ability to identify when a patient is taking too much of a prescribed substance, when a patient is non-compliant with a prescribed substance or when a patient is taking unprescribed or illicit substances. Our diagnostic laboratory offerings support the needs of our physicians across our existing specialties and new service lines. � We employ two models in connection with our network of multi-specialty physician practices. In the state of Florida, where the law does not preclude a business corporation from employing physicians, we own and operate Tampa Pain Relief Center, Inc., a wholly-owned business with several locations throughout Florida. In states other than Florida, we operate physician practices pursuant to long-term management service agreements with separate professional corporations that are wholly-owned by physicians. _Optical Services_ Our optical services segment contributed approximately 1% of our total revenue in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. _Sources of Revenue — Ancillary Services and Optical Services Segments_ The fees charged for services in our other segments depend on a variety of factors, including the type of service provided, the location in which the service is provided and the provider of the service. Service fees are received from both private and government third-party sources of payment. The amounts that we receive in payment for the provision of ancillary and optical services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third-party payors. Our ancillary services revenue primarily consists of fee for service revenue that is derived principally from the provision of physician and laboratory services to patients of our surgical facilities. Medicare pays for physician services based upon the MPFS. Payment rates under the MPFS are determined based on (i) relative value units for the services provided, (ii) a geographic adjustment factor and (iii) a conversion factor. Payment rates under the MPFS are updated annually by HHS. The primary element in each year’s update calculation is the Medicare Economic Index (‘‘MEI’’), which is a measure of the inflation of the cost of operating a physician practice. The update is then adjusted in conformity with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (‘‘MACRA’’), which was enacted in April 2015. MACRA established a fixed 0.5% annual adjustment through calendar year 2018. Beginning in 2019, Medicare compensation to physicians and physician practices will be subject to adjustment under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (‘‘MIPS’’). Under MIPS, physicians will be assigned a composite performance score based on measures of quality, resource use, meaningful use of electronic health records, and clinical practice improvement activities. A threshold performance score will be set annually by CMS at the mean or median of all composite scores for a prior annual performance period. Performance exceeding the threshold will result in a positive adjustment, performance below the threshold will result in a negative adjustment, and performance at the threshold will result in no adjustment. Physicians who participate in certain alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations, will be guaranteed a positive payment adjustment under MACRA. The effect of the payment methodology changes under MACRA on our physician practices cannot be predicted. Certain of our laboratory ancillary services are reimbursed by Medicare under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (‘‘CLFS’’). Under a June 23, 2016 final rule that implemented the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (‘‘PAMA’’), as of January 1, 2018 the CLFS payment methodology was adjusted so that payment amounts for laboratory tests on the CLFS is determined by calculating a weighted 5 ----- median of private payor rates using reported private payor rates and associated volume (number of tests). For tests that were paid on the CLFS prior to the implementation of PAMA, any reduction in payment amount will be phased in over the first six years of payment under the new system.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

The OPPS, established by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’), determines payment amounts prospectively (generally the following calendar year) for various categories of medical services performed in HOPDs. On November 21, 2018, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2019. The final rule provides for a payment rate increase of 1.35%. Hospitals that do not meet the reporting requirements of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program will be subject to a 2.0% payment rate decrease. Additionally, as a result of legislative changes related to off-campus HOPDs, certain off-campus HOPDs that began billing under the OPPS (or underwent certain changes) on or after November 2, 2015 are no longer paid for most services under the OPPS. Instead, these facilities are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (‘‘MPFS’’), which typically results in lower reimbursements. Services provided in a dedicated emergency department are still paid under the OPPS. This change has not significantly affected reimbursement to any of our HOPDs, but we cannot assure you that our HOPDs will not be impacted in the future. 3 ----- _Medicare Reimbursement — Hospital Inpatient Services_ Fifteen of our surgical facilities are licensed as hospitals. Most inpatient services provided by hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under the inpatient prospective payment system (‘‘IPPS’’). Under the IPPS, a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on each patient’s final assigned Medicare-severity diagnosis related group (‘‘MS-DRG’’). Each MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate that is prospectively set by CMS using national average resources used per case for treating a patient with a particular diagnosis. This assignment also affects the prospectively determined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. MS-DRG and capital payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the ‘‘hospital market basket index,’’ gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. On August 17, 2018, CMS published the IPPS final rule for federal fiscal year (‘‘FFY’’) 2019, which began on October 1, 2018. Under the FFY 2019 final rule, rates for inpatient stays in hospitals paid under the IPPS that successfully report certain quality data under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (‘‘IQR’’) Program and demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record (‘‘EHR’’) technology will be increased by 1.35%. Those hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program (but are meaningful EHR users) may receive a payment rate increase of only 0.625%. In addition to the IQR Program, hospitals will be subject to payment adjustments under the Value Based Purchasing Program, Readmissions Reduction Program and Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Programs that have been implemented by HHS. _Medicare Reimbursement — ASCs_ Payments under the Medicare program to ASCs are also made based on the OPPS. However, the payment received from CMS is a percentage of the payment to HOPDs. Reimbursement rates for ASCs are updated annually based on changes in the consumer price index offset by multifactor productivity adjustments. Based on the OPPS Final Rule, ASC reimbursement rates will increase by 1.35% for 2019. CMS has established the Ambulatory Surgical Center for Quality Reporting (‘‘ASCQR’’) Program as a pay-for-reporting, quality data program. Our ASCs that participate in the ASCQR Program receive the full annual update to the ASC payment rate. Those ASCs that do not successfully report quality data under the ASCQR Program may receive a payment reduction. _Annual Cost Reports_ Hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system, may be required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be payable to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers may appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. While ASCs are not currently subject to federal cost reporting requirements, it is possible that such requirements, which could be costly for us, will be implemented by CMS in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

At the same time, we completed the Transactions (as defined below). In the last five years we have also completed the acquisition of Symbion, which materially expanded our network of existing facilities and ancillary services. Acquisition Program._ In addition to our corporate strategy, we continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our presence in the surgical facility market by making strategic acquisitions of existing surgical facilities and by developing new surgical facilities in cooperation with local physician partners and, when appropriate, healthcare systems and other strategic partners. We generally structure our partnerships as two-way arrangements where either we are a majority owner partnered with physicians or we are a minority owner with buy-up rights. These buy-up rights give us the option to own a controlling interest at some point in the future. Alternatively, we may choose to pursue a three-way arrangement with physicians and a healthcare system. We employ a dedicated acquisition team with experience in healthcare services. Our team seeks to acquire surgical facilities that meet our criteria, including prominence and quality of physician partners, specialty mix, opportunities for growth, level of competition in the local market, level of managed care penetration and our ability to access managed care organization contracts. We carefully evaluate each of our acquisition opportunities through an extensive due diligence process to determine which facilities have the greatest potential for growth and profitability improvements under our operating structure. Our team may also identify opportunities to attract additional physicians to increase the acquired facility’s revenues and profitability. Development Program._ We develop surgical facilities in markets that we identify as having substantial interest by physicians and payors. We have experience in developing both single and multi-specialty surgical facilities. When we develop a new surgical facility, we generally provide all of the services necessary to complete the project. We offer in-house capabilities for structuring partnerships and financing facilities and work with architects and construction firms in the design and development of surgical facilities. Before and during the development phase of a new surgical facility, we analyze the competitive environment in the local market, review market data to identify appropriate services to provide, prepare and analyze financial forecasts, evaluate regulatory and licensing issues and assist in designing the surgical facility and identifying appropriate equipment to purchase or lease.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Non-GAAP Metrics.’’ 14 ----- When we use the term ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA,’’ it is referring to net income minus (a) net income attributable to non-controlling interests plus (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) equity-based compensation expense, (e) contingent acquisition compensation expense, (f) transaction, integration and acquisition costs, (g) loss (gain) on litigation settlements, (h) gain on acquisition escrow release, (i) loss (gain) on disposal and deconsolidations, net, (j) reserve adjustments, (i) impairment charges, (k) gain on amendment to tax receivable agreement, (l) tax receivable agreement (benefit) expense and (m) loss on debt refinancing. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from this non-GAAP metric are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believe such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum because we believe it is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as their calculation eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as these items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows from operating activities or other operation statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding revolving loan borrowings under our Revolver (as defined below), there were $3.8 million principal amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Revolver, and we had $71.2 million of unused commitments available to be borrowed under the Revolver. The 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments will increase the commitments under the Revolver to an aggregate amount equal to $120.0 million. In addition to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes and the notes, our aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom includes approximately $104.7 million of notes payable and capital lease obligations primarily related to property and equipment for operations. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. In addition, subject to applicable restrictions under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes and the Indenture, we may incur significant additional indebtedness, which may be secured, from time to time, which could have important consequences, including: � making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the notes; � making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; � requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to making payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; � limiting our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic conditions generally; and � limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes. 18 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, and also might include incurring additional fees in connection with refinancing, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Indenture, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to any legal, contractual or other limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, 19 ----- other than under their applicable guarantees (if any) of the notes and their applicable guarantees of certain (if any) other indebtedness, to make any funds available to us. In addition, under U.S. federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state and foreign fraudulent transfer laws, the incurrence of joint and several liability by our guarantors in respect of our obligations under the notes could be voided in certain circumstances. Certain of our Restricted Subsidiaries are subject to Permitted Payment Restrictions (as defined in the Description of Notes) that may limit their ability to make dividends and distributions in respect of their Capital Stock (as defined in the Description of Notes) to Surgery Center Holdings or the other Restricted Subsidiaries. While such restrictions must not materially impair our ability to pay scheduled payments of cash interest and to make required principal payments on the notes, as determined at the times set forth in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Payment Restrictions’’, and our operating agreements, subject to certain exceptions, require that our Restricted Subsidiaries distribute excess cash to us, there can be no assurances that over time none of the foregoing restrictions will ever constitute a material impediment to our receipt of cash from our Restricted Subsidiaries and on our ability to make payments of principal and interest on the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

As a result of these and other covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, we may be required to maintain specified financial maintenance ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity.

If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under any of our existing or future indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities 20 ----- that are secured by our assets, the holders of such indebtedness could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could foreclose on such assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the Indenture at such time. Furthermore, if the holders of such indebtedness foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by such assets or the equity interests in guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes. Any such indebtedness may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of assets available to satisfy holders of the notes. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,453.4 million of outstanding Term Loan borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, there were $3.8 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolver, and we had $71.2 million of unutilized capacity under the Revolver.

Claims of creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the notes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1.6 billion, or 89.0% of our revenue, approximately $263.8 million, or 112.4%, of our Adjusted EBITDA, including intercompany transactions, and as of December 31, 2018, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $747.5 million, or 16.0%, of our consolidated assets, and approximately $377.2 million, or 13.0%, of our consolidated liabilities, each excluding intercompany balances.

1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,Under certain circumstances a court could cancel the notes or the related guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws.,13.8.1,,"The issuance of the notes and the related guarantees may be subject to review under federal or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law or similar laws. If the Issuer becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or encounters other financial difficulty, a court might avoid or cancel its obligations under the notes. A court might do so if it found that, when the Issuer issued the notes, (i) it received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (ii) the Issuer (1) was rendered insolvent, (2) was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business or (3) believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay. A court could also avoid the notes, without regard to factors (i) and (ii), if it found that the Issuer issued the notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s creditors. Similarly, if one of the guarantors becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or encounters other financial difficulty, a court might avoid or cancel its guarantee if it finds that when such guarantor issued its guarantee (or in some jurisdictions, when payments became due under the guarantee), factors (i) and (ii) in the immediately preceding paragraph above applied to such guarantor, such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it (if, in either case, after final judgment the judgment is unsatisfied), or, without regard to such factors (i) and (ii), if it found that such guarantor issued its guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. 21 ----- In addition, a court could avoid or undo any payment by the Issuer or any guarantor pursuant to the notes or a guarantee and require the disgorgement and return to the Issuer or guarantor of any payment or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the Issuer or guarantor. In addition, under certain circumstances, a court could subordinate rather than avoid obligations under the notes or the guarantees, and in that event, the Issuer’s obligations under the notes or any such guarantor’s guarantee would be subordinated (including structurally) to all of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s other debt. If the court were to avoid, cancel or subordinate any guarantee, funds may not be available to pay the notes from another guarantor or from any other source. The test for determining solvency for purposes of the foregoing and below will vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. In general, a court would consider an entity insolvent either if the sum of its existing debts exceeds the fair value of all of its property, or its assets’ present fair saleable value is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become due. For this analysis, ‘‘debts’’ includes contingent and unliquidated debts. A court could also find that an entity was insolvent if it either was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, with unreasonably small capital, or it intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured. The Indenture governing the notes will limit the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This limitation will not necessarily protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. It is not clear, however, whether those limits would ultimately be adhered to or otherwise enforceable. If a court avoided the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the obligations of all of the guarantors under their guarantees, purchasers of the notes could cease to be the Issuer’s creditors or creditors of the guarantors and would likely have no source from which to recover amounts due under the notes. Even if the guarantee of a guarantor is not avoided as a fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to that guarantor’s other debt, and in that event, the guarantees would be subordinated (including structurally) to all of such guarantor’s other debt.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,We may be unable to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.,13.9.1,,"Upon the occurrence of specified kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes. If we are required to repurchase the notes, we would probably require third-party financing. We cannot be sure that we would be able to obtain third party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. However, the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’ will likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of our capital stock or assets has occurred, in which case, the ability of a holder of the notes to obtain the benefit of an offer to repurchase all of a portion of the notes held by such holder may be impaired. See ‘‘Description of Notes — Change of Control.’’ It is also possible that the events that constitute a change of control may also be events of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These events may permit the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. If we are required to repurchase the notes pursuant 22 ----- to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities if such indebtedness is accelerated, we would probably require third-party financing. We cannot be sure that we would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.

There is no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions.

The initial purchasers of the notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for quotation through an automated dealer quotation system. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In that case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes.

Our surgical facilities, which include ASCs and surgical hospitals, primarily provide non-emergency surgical procedures across many specialties, including, among others, gastroenterology (‘‘GI’’), general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics and pain management. Our surgical hospitals provide services, such as diagnostic imaging, laboratory, obstetrics, oncology, pharmacy, physical therapy and wound care. Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented by our suite of ancillary services, which support our physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient patient care. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from rising consumerism and payors’ and patients’ focus on the delivery of high quality care and superior clinical outcomes in the lowest cost and care setting. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated, primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of 123 surgical facilities comprised of 108 ASCs and 15 surgical hospitals across 31 states. We owned a majority interest in 84 of the surgical facilities and consolidated 106 of these facilities for financial reporting purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 521,000 surgical procedures were performed in our surgical facilities, generating approximately $1.7 billion in revenue. We continue to focus on improving our same-facility performance, selectively acquiring established facilities and developing new facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired five surgical facilities in new markets, two surgical facilities in existing markets, one of which was merged into an existing facility and multiple physician practices for a total investment of $106.4 million. Further, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we disposed of four surgery centers, two surgical hospitals and two optical businesses for net cash proceeds of $18.7 million, and recognized a net pretax loss of $21.2 million. This non-cash loss was primarily a result of the write-off of the net assets of the facility (net of proceeds received) and was primarily driven by the write-off of the associated goodwill. 30 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

Patient service revenues consist of revenue from our surgical facility services and ancillary services segments. Specifically, patient service revenues include fees for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed at surgical facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, as well as for patient visits to our physician practices, anesthesia services, pharmacy services and diagnostic screens ordered by our physicians. Other service revenues consist of product sales from our optical laboratories, which were sold in 2018, as well as the discounts and handling charges billed to the members of our optical products purchasing organization. Other service revenues also include management and administrative service fees derived from our non-consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method, management of surgical facilities and physician practices in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician practices for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets.

The increase in other service revenues is primarily due to an increase in management and administrative service fees derived from non-consolidated surgical facilities that we account for under the equity method and management of surgical facilities in which we do not own an interest, primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of NSH. Additionally, total revenues in 2018 reflect the impact of our adoption of ASU 2014-09 as discussed in ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies — Revenue _Recognition’’ above._ Cost of Revenues._ Cost of revenues were $1.4 billion in 2018 compared to $1.0 billion in 2017, with the increase in costs primarily attributable to our 2018 and 2017 acquisitions and an increase in supply costs associated with higher acuity surgical case volume. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues were 76.9% and 75.6% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $93.6 million and $76.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in these expenses is primarily attributable to the acquisition of NSH, but also reflects increases in equity-based compensation, rent costs and general inflation. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 5.3% in 2018 compared to 5.7% in 2017. This increase includes $7.0 million attributable to the acquisition of NSH, which was included in our operations for four months of 2017 but for all 12 months of 2018. Depreciation and Amortization._ Depreciation and amortization was $67.4 million and $51.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2018 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of NSH. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses were 3.8% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2017. Provision for Doubtful Accounts._ As described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2018, which resulted in a change in recognition of our provision for doubtful accounts. Beginning in 2018, we considered such amounts as implicit price concessions and recorded that estimate as a component of reported revenue. Prior periods were not reclassified based on the modified retrospective transition method adopted by the Company. Income from Equity Investments._ Income from equity investments was $8.9 million and $6.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is attributed the four equity method investments that were included in the acquisition of NSH. Loss on Disposals and Deconsolidations, Net._ The net loss on disposals and deconsolidations was $31.8 million in 2018, which included a net loss of $20.1 million on the disposal of six surgical facilities and our optical laboratory, and the deconsolidation of a surgical facility. The remaining loss is related to disposals of other long-lived assets. The net loss on disposals and deconsolidations in 2017 was attributable to disposals of other long-lived assets. 40 ----- Transaction and Integration Costs._ We incurred $31.7 million of transaction and integration costs in 2018 compared to $13.1 million in 2017, as a majority of integration costs were incurred in 2018 for the NSH acquisition as well as other acquisitions that occurred in 2018 (refer to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail). Impairment charges._ As described in the Critical Accounting Policies section above, in 2018 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $60.7 million and $13.7 million for goodwill assigned to our Ancillary Services and Alliance reporting units, respectively. This charge was warranted based on the calculated fair value compared to the carrying value of these reporting units. Loss on Debt Refinancing._ In 2017, we incurred a loss on debt refinancing of $18.2 million. The 2017 loss includes the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the prepayment and termination of our then-existing senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility and a portion of costs incurred with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Loss (Gain) on Litigation Settlement._ We incurred a loss on a potential resolution of an investigation in the amount of $46.0 million in 2018 related to the government investigation discussed in Item 3. ‘‘Legal Proceedings’’ in our 2018 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In 2017, we recorded a gain of $12.5 million related to legal settlements reached in 2017. Tax Receivable Agreement._ In 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement gain of $16.4 million primarily as a result of the amendment of the TRA. No such gain occurred in 2018. Also in 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement benefit of $25.3 million related to a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We did not incur a tax receivable agreement benefit in 2018. Interest Expense, Net._ Interest expense, net, increased to $147.0 million in 2018 compared to $117.7 million in 2017. The increase primarily relates to the issuance of our $370 million Senior Unsecured Notes on June 30, 2017 due 2025 and an increase in our variable rate debt due to the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of August 31, 2017. Additionally, we entered into an incremental term loan amendment to provide for a $180.0 million senior secured incremental term loan, which was fully drawn on October 23, 2018. As a percentage of revenues, interest expense, net was 8.3% in 2018 compared to 8.8% in 2017. Income Tax Expense (Benefit)._ Income tax expense was $26.5 million and $53.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was (38.3)% for 2018 compared to 65.1% in 2017. The change in effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the tax-effect of the non-deductible goodwill impairment and the valuation allowance that was recorded related to the 163(j) interest deferred tax asset. Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests._ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $110.1 million and $81.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in this amount is predominantly due to the inclusion of NSH for the full-year of 2018. As a percentage of revenues, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was 6.2% in the 2018 period and 6.1% for the 2017 period.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The presentation of the amount of earnings from operations and net earnings were unchanged upon adoption of the new standard; however, during the year of adoption, we determined that amounts historically considered to be bad debt should be considered an implicit price concession, as defined in FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606, ‘‘Revenue From _Contracts With Customers’’. This resulted in changes to the presentation of revenues and the provision for_ bad debts in the consolidated statements of operations. Previously, the estimate for unrealizable amounts was recorded to the provision for bad debts and presented as a component of operating expenses. Upon reassessment during the year of adoption, the estimate for unrealizable amounts is now reflected as an implicit price concession as a reduction to arrive at net revenue. This change in presentation was not material to the financial statements. Our patient service revenues are derived from surgical procedures performed at our ASCs, patient visits to physician practices, anesthesia services provided to patients, pharmacy services and diagnostic screens ordered by our physicians. The fees for such services are billed either to the patient or a third-party payor, including Medicare and Medicaid. We recognize patient service revenues, net of contractual allowances, which we estimate based on the historical trend of our cash collections and contractual write-offs. Our optical products purchasing organization negotiates volume buying discounts with optical product manufacturers. The buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing organization represent the revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes. Revenue is recognized as orders are shipped to members. Product sale revenues from our optical laboratories and marketing products and services businesses, net of an allowance for returns and discounts, is recognized when the product is shipped or service is provided to the customer. We base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return activity and discounts given. 34 ----- Other service revenues consist of management and administrative service fees derived from non-consolidated surgical facilities that we account for under the equity method, management of surgical facilities in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets. The fees we derive from these management arrangements are based on a predetermined percentage of the revenues of each surgical facility and physician network.

While changes in estimated reimbursement from third-party payors remain a possibility, we expect that any such changes would be minimal and, therefore, would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor, size of claim and estimated collection percentage for each patient account. The operating systems used to manage our patient accounts provide for an aging schedule in 30-day increments, by payor, physician and patient. We analyze accounts receivable at each of our surgical facilities to ensure the proper collection and aged category. The operating systems generate reports that assist in the collection efforts by prioritizing patient accounts. Collection efforts include direct contact with insurance carriers or patients, written correspondence and the use of legal or collection agency assistance, as required. Our days sales outstanding was 63 days for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 61 days for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recognize that final reimbursement of outstanding accounts receivable is subject to final approval by each third-party payor. However, because we have contracts with our third-party payors and we verify the insurance coverage of the patient before services are rendered, the amounts that are pending approval from third-party payors are minimal. Amounts are classified outside of self-pay if we have an agreement with the third-party payor or we have verified a patient’s coverage prior to services rendered. It is our policy to collect co-payments and deductibles prior to providing services, where possible. It is also our policy to verify a patient’s insurance 72 hours prior to the patient’s procedure. Because our services are primarily non-emergency, our surgical facilities have the ability to control these procedures. Our patient service revenues from self-pay payors as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 3% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.12,Critical Accounting Policies,17.12.4,Income Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreement,"We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If a net operating loss (‘‘NOL’’) carryforward exists, we make a determination as to whether that NOL carryforward will be utilized in the future. A valuation allowance will be established for certain NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain. The carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based upon estimates and assumptions related to our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2018, we had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards (‘‘NOLs’’) of approximately $516.8 million. Under the Tax Act (as defined below), any U.S. federal NOLs arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 will carry forward indefinitely. However, NOLs arising in taxable years ending before December 31, 2017 will still be subject to a carry forward limitation of 35 ----- 20 years. Our unused NOLs expire in various amounts at varying times beginning in 2025. Unless they expire, these NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our income taxes otherwise payable. We recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaling $50.4 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The valuation allowance has been established for certain deferred tax assets for which we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized, which are primarily interest carryforwards under Section 163(j) (‘‘Section 163(j)’’) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), certain state net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. If our expectations for future operating results on a consolidated basis or at the state jurisdiction level vary from actual results due to changes in healthcare regulations, general economic conditions, or other factors, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets. Our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases, respectively, in our valuation allowance in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. These changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Section 382 (‘‘Section 382’’) of the Code imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ to use its NOLs to reduce its tax liability. An ‘‘ownership change’’ is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50.0% of a corporation’s ‘‘stock’’ by its ‘‘5-percent shareholders’’ (as defined in Section 382) over a rolling three-year period based upon each of those shareholder’s lowest percentage of stock owned during such period. As a result of the Symbion acquisition in 2014, approximately $179 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $4.9 million, and, as a result of the NovaMed acquisition in 2011, approximately $17 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $4.9 million. As a result of the NSH acquisition, approximately $20.5 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $2.8 million. The Private Sale resulted in an ownership change as defined in Section 382. As a result, approximately $461.2 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $14.2 million. At this time, we do not believe this limitation, when combined with amounts allowable due to net unrecognized built in gains, will affect our ability to use any NOLs before they expire. However, no such assurances can be provided. If our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset taxable income generated in the future is subject to this limitation, it could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ‘‘Tax Act’’) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly affected U.S. federal income tax law. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for 100% expensing of certain capital expenditures, and limits certain interest expense deductions. The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is complete: reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, 100% expensing of capital expenditures, and the interest expense limitation under Section 163(j). _Tax Receivable Agreement_ On May 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to amend our Income Tax Receivable Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 (as amended, the ‘‘TRA’’), between the Company, and the other parties referred to therein, which amendment became effective on August 31, 2017. Pursuant to the amendment to the TRA, we agreed to make payments to H.I.G., our former controlling shareholder, in its capacity as the stockholders representative pursuant to a fixed payment schedule. The amounts payable under the TRA are calculated as the product of (i) an annual base amount and (ii) the maximum corporate federal income tax rate for the applicable year plus three percent. The amounts payable under the TRA are related to our projected realized tax savings over the next five years and are not dependent on our actual tax savings. 36 ----- Amounts payable pursuant to the TRA will be adjusted downward in the event that the maximum corporate federal income tax rate is reduced. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA and such inability is a result of the terms of credit agreements and other debt documents that are materially more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid. If the terms of such credit agreements and other debt documents cause us to be unable to make payments under the TRA and such terms are not materially more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points until paid. As a result of the amendment to the TRA, we were required to value the liability under the TRA by discounting the fixed payment schedule using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Assuming our tax rate is 24%, calculated as the maximum corporate federal tax rate plus three percent, throughout the remaining term of the TRA, we estimate the total remaining amounts payable under the TRA are approximately $64.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The carrying value of the liability under the TRA, reflecting the discount as discussed above, was $48.5 million as of December 31, 2018",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below an operating segment. As of October 1, 2018, we have identified three reporting units, which include the following: 1) Surgical Facilities, 2) Ancillary Services, and 3) The Alliance, including Optical Synergies (‘‘Alliance’’). The Alliance is a component of our Optical Services operating segment. In 2018, we disposed of two previously identified reporting units, Midwest Labs and Family Vision Care. We compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. To determine the fair value of the reporting units, we obtained valuations at the reporting unit level prepared by third-party valuation specialists. This valuation is based on a combination of conventional income and market valuation calculations. The discounted cash flow (‘‘DCF’’) model that is used in our income valuation is projected based on a year-by-year assessment that considers historical results, estimated market conditions, internal projections, and relevant publicly available statistics. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including assumptions about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans aligned with provided guidance and, when applicable, various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The variables within the discount rate, many of which are outside of our control, provide the best estimate of all assumptions applied within the DCF model. There can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections. In determining the fair value under the market approaches, the analysis includes a control premium, which was based on observable market data and a review of selected transactions of companies that operate in our sector. While we believe that all assumptions utilized in the testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the assumptions used include changes to the discount and growth rates and a change in the equity and enterprise premiums being realized in the market. As of October 1, 2018, prior to our impairment testing, our three reporting units with allocated goodwill were as follows: 1) Surgical Facilities — $3.3 billion, 2) Ancillary Services — $80.0 million, and 3) The Alliance, including Optical Synergies (‘‘Alliance’’) — $25.3 million. As of the October 1, 2018 valuation, the fair value for the Surgical Facilities reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. For the Ancillary Services and Alliance reporting units, the carrying value exceeded the fair value, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $60.7 million and $13.7 million, respectively. 37 ----- As a result of the impairment charges, the fair value equaled carrying value as of October 1, 2018 for the Ancillary Services and Alliance reporting units, any future adverse events or changes in the assumptions could require additional impairment. Subsequent to the date of our annual impairment test, we considered our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, and other market indicators including our market capitalization. Based on our evaluation of all such factors, we concluded that an event had not occurred or circumstances had not changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying values. In connection with the implementation of pushdown accounting, we performed our goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2017, then re-evaluated for impairment at October 1, 2017. Both evaluations resulted in no impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

This increase in patient service revenues was primarily attributable to the 2017 acquisition of NSH. Cost of Revenues._ Cost of revenues were $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to $821.2 million in 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to our 2017 and 2016 acquisitions, and an increase in supply costs due to a higher acuity surgical case volume.

These items related to a legal settlements for the year in which the settlements were reached. Tax Receivable Agreement._ In 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement gain of $16.4 million primarily as a result of the amendment of the TRA. No such gain occurred in 2016. Also in 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement benefit of $25.3 million related to a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2016 expense was recorded to update the initial estimated liability for the filed tax returns and final 2015 tax losses that are included in the amounts payable under the TRA. Interest Expense, Net._ Interest expense, net, increased to $117.7 million in 2017 compared to $100.6 million in 2016. The increase primarily relates to the issuance of our $370 million Senior Unsecured Notes on June 30, 2017 due 2025 and the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of August 31, 2017. Income Tax Expense (Benefit)._ Income tax expense was $53.6 million and $7.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate was 65.1% for 2017 and 7.7% for 2016. The change in effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests._ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $81.7 million and $75.6 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of NSH. As a percentage of revenues, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was 6.1% in 2017 and 6.6% in 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

Pursuant to the Amended TRA, the Company agreed to make payments to H.I.G. Surgery Centers, LLC, in its capacity as the stockholders representative pursuant to a fixed payment schedule.

To the extent that the Company is unable to make payments under the Amended TRA and such inability is a result of the terms of credit agreements and other debt documents that are materially more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid.

By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Ownership of the Notes — Under certain circumstances a court could cancel the notes or the related guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws.’’ The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will automatically and unconditionally be released and terminate upon: (1) any sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation or merger) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale or other disposition is permitted by the Indenture; 60 ----- (2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘— Defeasance’’ and ‘‘— Satisfaction and Discharge’’; or (4) such Guarantor being released from all of its obligations under all of its Guarantees of (i) payment by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an ‘‘Other Guarantee’’) as a result of its Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Guarantees,’’ the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such Indebtedness of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated). Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation will be subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

None of the Trustee, the applicable registrar nor any of their agents shall be liable 62 ----- for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph (including the procedures of the relevant depositaries). No Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically (when in global form) or mailed by first-class mail (when in physical form) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is (a) issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or (b) subject to one or more conditions precedent and such redemption date is delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), as described above. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, as such date may be delayed, unless such redemption is cancelled as described above. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,2663,REDEMPTION YEAR** **PRICE,2663.4,Change of Control,2663.4.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, subject to the exceptions described below, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register as provided under ‘‘— Selection and Notice,’’ describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent 63 ----- that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Credit Agreement provides, and we expect that future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder and may prohibit or limit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness, including Secured Indebtedness, are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption ‘‘— Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 64 ----- The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

The period of time between a Suspension Date and a Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ 65 ----- On any Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the applicable Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of ‘‘— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; provided, that no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Subsidiaries’’ as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on and after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ on and after any Reversion Date. During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligations to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date, but no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Guarantees’’ after the end of a Suspension Period with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, in the case of term indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit indebtedness. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Specified Transaction that has been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the applicable Test Period or subsequent to the end of such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming that all Specified Transactions (and the change in any associated interest coverage obligations and change in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein, as applicable, attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of such Test Period.

Interest on a Finance Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Finance Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. ‘‘Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the total amount of depreciation and amortization expense, including the amortization of deferred financing fees or costs, debt issuance costs, commissions, fees, and expenses, capitalized expenditures (including Capitalized Software Expenditures), expenditures relating to software, license and intellectual property payments, any lease related assets recorded in purchase accounting, customer acquisition costs, original issue discount resulting from the issuance of Indebtedness at less than par and incentive payments, conversion costs, and contract acquisition costs of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period on a consolidated basis and otherwise determined in accordance with GAAP. ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the Consolidated Net Income of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period: (1) increased by (without duplication): (a) provision for taxes based on income or profits or capital, including U.S. federal, state, non-U.S., franchise, excise, value added, and similar taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries paid, expected to be paid, or accrued during such period, including any penalties and interest related to such taxes or arising from any tax examinations, deducted (and not added back) in computing Consolidated Net Income;

provided that such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable in the good faith determination of the Issuer, and (C) the amount of ‘‘run-rate’’ impact on Consolidated EBITDA occurring as a result of business initiatives consummated, continued or expanded prior to or after the Issue Date and not contemplated by 108 ----- sub-clauses (A) and (B) of this clause (i) projected by the Issuer in good faith as a result of actions either taken or expected to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (in each case, in the good faith determination of the Issuer) within 24 months of the applicable business initiative;

Following the initial distribution of notes, such notes may be transferred to certain institutional ‘‘accredited investors’’ in the secondary market, and such notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons (the ‘‘IAI Global Note’’ and, together with the Regulation S Global Note and the 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). On the date of issuance, the Global Notes will be deposited with the trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), as custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Note on behalf of their participants through their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold the interests in the Regulation S Global Note in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Through and including the period ending 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the notes (the ‘‘40 Day Period’’), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be held through Euroclear and Clearstream (as indirect participants in DTC).

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee or any of their agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: � a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law; � a ‘‘banking organization’’ under New York Banking Law; � a member of the Federal Reserve System; � a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and � a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the 150 ----- lack of a definite certificate for that interest.

We and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that could arise from the use of this offering memorandum or to contribute to payments which they may be required to make in that respect. The notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable law. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any market making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in connection with the offering. � Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. � Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. � Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. � Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These over-allotments, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and their affiliates have from time to time performed, various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking and other related services for us and our affiliates for which they have received customary compensation, and they may continue to do so in the future. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may be holders of the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may receive customary fees and expenses in connection with their commitments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. 156 ----- Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. Further, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities or related derivative securities and financial instruments which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments.

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR U.S. HOLDERS",2664.1.2,Original Issue Discount,"The notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The notes will be considered to be issued with OID if the stated redemption price at maturity of the notes exceeds its ‘‘issue price’’ (as defined above) by at least a statutorily-defined de minimis amount. The OID de minimis amount equals [1]⁄4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity. The ‘‘stated redemption price at maturity’’ of the notes is the total of all payments provided by the notes that are not payments of stated interest. The amount of OID on a note will generally be equal to the excess of the principal amount of such note over its ‘‘issue price’’. A U.S. holder will generally be required to include such OID in gross income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the OID accrues, on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable regardless of the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally must include in income in each taxable year the sum of the daily portions of OID for each day on which it held such note during the taxable year. To determine the daily portions of OID, the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is determined, and a ratable portion of such OID is allocated to each day in the accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will equal the product of such note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of the accrual period and such note’s ‘‘yield to maturity’’ (adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period), less the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. A note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of any accrual period generally will be its issue price, increased by the amount 159 ----- of OID, if any, allocable to all prior accrual periods. A note’s yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value (as of the issue date) of all payments to be made on the note, produces an amount equal to the note’s issue price. An accrual period may be of any length, and the length of the accrual periods may vary over the life of the note, provided that no accrual period may be longer than one year. Each scheduled payment of stated interest or principal on the Note must occur on either the first day or last day of an accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S. holder will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. holder may elect to treat all interest on a note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in which a U.S. holder acquired the note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors about this election.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

It: � is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury Department regulations, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) or to different interpretations; � does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you do not hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (that is, for investment purposes); � does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you do not purchase the notes in the initial offering for the original ‘‘issue price’’ within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for cash to the public, not including bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers); � does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or that may be relevant to you because you are subject to special rules, such as rules applicable to banks, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, tax-exempt entities, S corporations, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar, insurance companies, broker-dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons holding the notes as part of a hedge, straddle, ‘‘constructive sale,’’ ‘‘conversion’’ or other integrated transaction, or former U.S. citizens or long-term residents subject to taxation as expatriates; � does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you use the accrual method of accounting that requires you to include any item of gross income with respect to the notes no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements; � does not discuss the effect of any state, local or foreign laws, any U.S. federal gift tax or estate tax considerations, or the 3.8% Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income; and � does not discuss tax considerations to an owner of notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes a partnership or other pass-through entity. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) with respect to the statements made herein, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements. As used in this section, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ of a note means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a citizen or individual of the United States, a corporation (or other entity treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (1) the trust is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. As used in this section, a ‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of a note that is not a U.S. holder and is not for U.S. federal income tax purposes a partnership or other pass-through entity. If a partnership, or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the 158 ----- partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership that holds the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. Under the terms of the notes, in certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of principal, or to redeem the notes in advance of their stated maturity. See ‘‘Description of Notes — Change of Control’’, ‘‘Description of Notes — Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes — Optional Redemption’’. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, that the payment of additional amounts and/or such redemptions are ‘‘remote’’ or ‘‘incidental’’ contingencies that should not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and that any additional amounts received pursuant to such redemptions should be taxable as capital gain at the time they are received or accrued, in accordance with your regular accounting method. Our determination will be binding on you unless you disclose your contrary position in the manner required by the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, the timing, character, and amount of income inclusions by you may be affected. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of these rules to the notes and the consequences thereof. This remainder of this discussion assumes that our position is correct.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

If the interest (including OID) and gain you receive is 160 ----- effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment), you will be subject to rules similar to those described above for U.S. holders and, therefore, such effectively connected income generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular graduated rates applicable to U.S. holders. In addition to this treatment, if you are a corporation, you could be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) of your ‘‘effectively connected earnings and profits’’ for the relevant taxable year. You will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest (including OID), as discussed below, although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) in order to obtain an exemption from withholding. These rules are complex, and you should consult your tax advisor.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,96,FATCA,96.2,,96.2.1,,"Subject to certain exceptions, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as modified by U.S. Treasury regulations, guidance from the IRS and intergovernmental agreements and subject to further guidance (collectively, ‘‘FATCA’’), impose a withholding tax of 30% on interest income (including OID) paid on a debt obligation of a United States company paid to (i) a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners), and (ii) a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. Withholding under FATCA generally will apply to payments of interest (including OID) on a note regardless of when they are made. While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the notes on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Although these recent U.S. Treasury Regulations are not final, they can be relied upon until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the applicable foreign country, or future U.S. Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements and result in the affected non-U.S. holders being subject to different rules. Each holder is strongly encouraged to consult with its tax advisor regarding the implications of the potential application of FATCA on the investment in a note.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,2666,CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS,2666.1,General Fiduciary Matters,2666.1.1,,"ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan subject to Title I of ERISA, and ERISA and the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (whether direct or indirect) to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary with respect to such ERISA Plan. Section 404(a)(1) of ERISA sets forth a general standard of behavior and restrictions for fiduciaries of ERISA Plans subject to Title I of ERISA. It requires that a fiduciary discharge its duties with respect to such an ERISA Plan (i) solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such ERISA Plan, (ii) for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the ERISA Plan, (iii) in accordance with a ‘‘prudent-man rule’’ (that is ‘‘with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims’’), (iv) by diversifying the investments of the ERISA Plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and (v) in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan insofar as they are consistent with ERISA. In considering an investment in the notes with the assets of any such ERISA Plan, a fiduciary should give appropriate consideration to, among other things, whether the acquisition and holding of the notes is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA or the Code including, without limitation, any prudence, diversification, delegation of control and 163 ----- prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA Plan’s portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plan’s purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolio’s composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan, and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan’s funding objectives. Similar duties and restrictions may apply to fiduciaries of Plans that are not subject to ERISA, such as governmental plans, church plans and non-U.S. plans. Fiduciaries of Plans subject to Similar Laws should consider their fiduciary duties under such Similar Laws in determining whether to invest in the notes offered hereby.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
1136_1,Offerings 2019.md,2666,CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS,2666.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,2666.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and certain persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest,’’ within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. The acquisition or holding of notes by or on behalf of an ERISA Plan could give rise to a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code if the Company or any of its affiliates is, or becomes, a party in interest or a disqualified person with respect to such ERISA Plan. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction (including, without limitation, the lending of money or the extension of credit by the ERISA Plan) may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. For example, an ERISA Plan holding a note would be viewed by the Department of Labor as a continuing extension of credit by the ERISA Plan to the Company. Accordingly, each original or subsequent purchaser or transferee of a note that is or may become an ERISA Plan is responsible for determining the extent, if any, to which the purchase and holding of a note will constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code, including an obligation to correct the transaction. The Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase or holding of a note. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95- 60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions involving non-fiduciary service providers or their affiliates. However, we cannot assure you that all of the conditions of any of these exemptions or of any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. Governmental plans, church plans and foreign plans are not generally subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code; however, such Plans may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of such a Plan should make its own determination as to the requirements, if any, under any Similar Law applicable to the acquisition and holding of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction, it is particularly important that Plan fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes (and holding the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation that an investment in the notes would meet any or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, or is appropriate for, a Plan. Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2019,176
