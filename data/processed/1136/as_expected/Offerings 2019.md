**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We believe that the financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in a
manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (‘‘GAAP’’) and the regulations published by the SEC, with the exception of the
presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures (‘‘non-GAAP Measures’’) which are presented as a
supplement to our results presented in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP Measures, as well as other statistical measures, including Credit Agreement EBITDA (as
defined herein), and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) are presented because management believes
these measures provide additional information regarding the Company’s performance and the Issuer’s ability
to service debt, and because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating operating performance
compared to that of other companies in our industry.

In addition, management believes that these measures are useful to assess the Company’s operating
performance trends because they exclude certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items
that are not expected to continue in the future, and certain other items. The non-GAAP Measures are not
presented in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s computation of these non-GAAP Measures may vary
from those used by other companies.

All non-GAAP Measures, including Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, have limitations as
analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income or
loss, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other financial
measures of operating performance, liquidity, indebtedness or otherwise derived in accordance with GAAP.
We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP Measures by relying primarily on our financial measures
derived in accordance with GAAP and using Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only for
supplemental purposes. The presentation of Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be
construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

For the definition of and additional information about Credit Agreement EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as
well as a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation to the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, see ‘‘Summary — Summary Historical Condensed Consolidated Financial
Information’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Certain Non-GAAP Metrics.’’

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information about us and this offering. This information is not complete_
_and does not contain all the information you should consider before investing in the notes or our common_
_stock. You should carefully read this entire offering memorandum including the section entitled ‘‘Risk_
_Factors’’ included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ included in_
_our 2018 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein, and the financial statements and the other_
_information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, before making an_
_investment decision._

**Our Company**

As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of
123 surgical facilities in the United States comprised of 108 ambulatory surgical centers (‘‘ASCs’’) and
15 surgical hospitals (‘‘surgical hospitals,’’ and together with ASCs referred to as ‘‘surgical facilities’’ or
‘‘facilities’’) across 31 states and we owned a majority interest in 84 of these facilities. During 2018, our
physicians provided services to patients in our surgical facilities generating approximately $1.7 billion in
revenue.

**Our Growth Strategies**

Our differentiated operating model employs a multifaceted strategy to grow revenue, earnings and cash flow.
We believe the following are key components to this strategy:

� Deliver outstanding patient care and clinical outcomes;

� Continue to execute and expand upon our physician engagement strategy in attractive markets;

� Become the partner of choice for physicians seeking to become or stay independent;

� Drive organic growth at existing facilities through targeted physician recruitment, service line
expansion and implementing our efficient operating model;

� Seek partnership opportunities with payors to make healthcare more affordable for their members;

� Continue our disciplined acquisition strategy;

� Introduce new service offerings to provide a more comprehensive continuum of care; and

� Enhance operational efficiencies and productivity by delivering on integration.

In addition, we believe favorable industry trends such as an aging population and advancements in medical
technology will further drive growth.

**Operations**

We operate in three reporting segments: surgical facility services, ancillary services and optical services.

� Our surgical facility services segment consists of the operation of ASCs and surgical hospitals, and
includes our anesthesia services. Our surgical facilities primarily provide non-emergency surgical
procedures across many specialties, including, among others, gastroenterology, general surgery,
ophthalmology, orthopedics, and pain management.

� Our ancillary services segment consists of a diagnostic laboratory and multi-specialty physician
practices. These physician practices include our owned and operated physician practices pursuant to
long-term management service agreements.

� Our optical services segment consists of an optical products group purchasing organization, and until
October 2018, an optical laboratory that manufactured eyewear.

**_Surgical Facility Services Segment_**
_Surgical Facility Operations_
As of December 31, 2018, we owned (primarily with physician investors or healthcare systems) or operated
123 surgical facilities, including 15 licensed hospitals. Our surgical facility services segment contributed
approximately 95%, 93% and 91% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our typical ASC is a free-standing facility that performs planned surgical procedures on an outpatient basis
for patients not requiring hospitalization and for whom an overnight stay is not expected after surgery. Each
center typically has one to four operating or procedure rooms with areas for reception, pre-operative care,
recovery and administration. The staff of our ASCs generally includes a center administrator, registered
nurses, operating room technicians, as well as other administrative staff.

Our surgical hospitals are generally larger than our ASCs and include inpatient hospital rooms and, in two
cases, a limited scope emergency department. Our surgical hospitals also provide ancillary services such as
diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, laboratory, obstetrics, physical therapy, oncology and wound care.

We operate both multi-specialty and single-specialty facilities. In multi-specialty facilities, a variety of
surgical procedures are performed, including, among others, gastroenterology, general surgery,
ophthalmology, orthopedics and pain management. We have diversified the mix of procedures performed at
our facilities by strategically introducing select specialties that will complement existing facilities. In many
cases, we keep certain facilities as single-specialty where it suits an individual facility or market demand.

Our surgical facilities are generally located in close proximity to physicians’ offices. We provide each of our
surgical facilities with a full range of financial, marketing and operating services. For example, our regional
managed care directors assist the local management team at each of our surgical facilities in developing
relationships with managed care providers and negotiating managed care contracts.

_Surgical Facility Ownership Structure_
We own and operate our surgical facilities through partnerships or limited liability companies with
physicians, physician groups and healthcare systems. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries typically serves
as the general partner or managing member of our surgical facilities. We generally seek to own a majority
interest in our surgical facilities, or otherwise have sufficient control over the facilities to be able to
consolidate the financial results of operations of the facilities with ours. In some instances, we will acquire
ownership in a surgical facility with the prior owners retaining ownership, and, in some cases, we offer new
ownership to other physicians or healthcare systems. We hold majority ownership in 84 of the 123 surgical
facilities in which we own an interest. We provide intercompany loans to some of the surgical facilities
which often are secured by a pledge of assets of the facility. We also have a management agreement with
the majority of our surgical facilities, under which we provide day-to-day management services for a
management fee, which is typically equal to a percentage of the facility revenue.

_Strategic Relationships_
When attractive opportunities arise, we may develop, acquire or operate surgical facilities through strategic
relationships with payors, healthcare systems, and other healthcare providers. We believe that forming such
relationships can enhance our ability to attract physicians and access favorable managed care contracts for
our surgical facilities in that market.

The strategic relationships through which we own and operate surgical facilities are governed by partnership
and operating agreements that are generally comparable to the partnership and operating agreements of the
other surgical facilities in which we own an interest. The primary difference between the structure of these
strategic relationships and the other surgical facilities in which we hold ownership is that, in these strategic
relationships, a healthcare system holds ownership in the surgical facility, in addition to physician investors.
In each of these strategic relationships, we also have entered into a management agreement under which
we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee equal to a percentage of the revenues of

the surgical facility. The terms of those management agreements are comparable to the terms of our
management agreements with other surgical facilities in which we own an interest.

_Sources of Revenue_
Revenue from our surgical facilities is earned from facility fees related to healthcare services performed in
our surgical facilities and is included in our patient service revenues. The fee charged for surgical services
varies depending on the type of service provided, but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating
room, a recovery room, special equipment, supplies, nursing staff and/or medications. Our fees do not
typically include professional fees charged by the patient’s surgeon, anesthesiologist or other attending
physician, which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third-party payor.

We are dependent upon private and government third-party sources of payment for the surgical services we
provide. The amounts that our surgical facilities receive in payment for their services may be adversely
affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including
Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations as well as cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced
reimbursement schedules of third-party payors.

The following table sets forth the percentage of total patient service revenues for our consolidated surgical
facilities by type of payor for the periods indicated:

We receive reimbursement from Medicare for surgical services based on three different payment systems
depending on the site of service: hospital outpatient surgical services, hospital inpatient surgical services
and outpatient surgical services generally provided in our ASCs.

_Medicare Reimbursement — Hospital Outpatient Departments_
Surgical services that are provided in hospital outpatient departments (‘‘HOPDs’’) are generally reimbursed
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (‘‘CMS’’) using the Outpatient Prospective Payment
System (the ‘‘OPPS’’). The OPPS, established by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services (‘‘HHS’’), determines payment amounts prospectively (generally the following calendar year) for
various categories of medical services performed in HOPDs. On November 21, 2018, CMS published its
OPPS final rule for 2019. The final rule provides for a payment rate increase of 1.35%. Hospitals that do
not meet the reporting requirements of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program will be
subject to a 2.0% payment rate decrease.

Additionally, as a result of legislative changes related to off-campus HOPDs, certain off-campus HOPDs that
began billing under the OPPS (or underwent certain changes) on or after November 2, 2015 are no longer
paid for most services under the OPPS. Instead, these facilities are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee
Schedule (‘‘MPFS’’), which typically results in lower reimbursements. Services provided in a dedicated
emergency department are still paid under the OPPS. This change has not significantly affected
reimbursement to any of our HOPDs, but we cannot assure you that our HOPDs will not be impacted in the
future.

-----

_Medicare Reimbursement — Hospital Inpatient Services_
Fifteen of our surgical facilities are licensed as hospitals. Most inpatient services provided by hospitals are
reimbursed by Medicare under the inpatient prospective payment system (‘‘IPPS’’). Under the IPPS, a
hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on each patient’s final assigned
Medicare-severity diagnosis related group (‘‘MS-DRG’’). Each MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate that is
prospectively set by CMS using national average resources used per case for treating a patient with a
particular diagnosis. This assignment also affects the prospectively determined capital rate paid with each
MS-DRG. MS-DRG and capital payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor
assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG
rates, known as the ‘‘hospital market basket index,’’ gives consideration to the inflation experienced by
hospitals in purchasing goods and services.

On August 17, 2018, CMS published the IPPS final rule for federal fiscal year (‘‘FFY’’) 2019, which began
on October 1, 2018. Under the FFY 2019 final rule, rates for inpatient stays in hospitals paid under the
IPPS that successfully report certain quality data under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (‘‘IQR’’)
Program and demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record (‘‘EHR’’) technology will be
increased by 1.35%. Those hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program
(but are meaningful EHR users) may receive a payment rate increase of only 0.625%. In addition to the
IQR Program, hospitals will be subject to payment adjustments under the Value Based Purchasing Program,
Readmissions Reduction Program and Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Programs that have been
implemented by HHS.

_Medicare Reimbursement — ASCs_
Payments under the Medicare program to ASCs are also made based on the OPPS. However, the payment
received from CMS is a percentage of the payment to HOPDs. Reimbursement rates for ASCs are updated
annually based on changes in the consumer price index offset by multifactor productivity adjustments.
Based on the OPPS Final Rule, ASC reimbursement rates will increase by 1.35% for 2019. CMS has
established the Ambulatory Surgical Center for Quality Reporting (‘‘ASCQR’’) Program as a pay-for-reporting,
quality data program. Our ASCs that participate in the ASCQR Program receive the full annual update to the
ASC payment rate. Those ASCs that do not successfully report quality data under the ASCQR Program may
receive a payment reduction.

_Annual Cost Reports_
Hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a prospective payment system, may be required to meet certain financial reporting requirements.
Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying
medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries
and Medicaid recipients. Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are
subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately
determined to be payable to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often
takes several years. Providers may appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. While
ASCs are not currently subject to federal cost reporting requirements, it is possible that such requirements,
which could be costly for us, will be implemented by CMS in the future.

**_Ancillary Services and Optical Services Segments_**
_Ancillary Services_
Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented by a suite of ancillary services, which support
our physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient patient care. Rather than contracting with thirdparty providers, in some geographies we own ancillary businesses including a diagnostic laboratory, multispecialty physician practices, urgent care facilities and anesthesia services. Our Company, physicians and
patients benefit from these services through improved clinical efficiency and scheduling, and from
incremental revenue associated with retaining these fees. Our ancillary services segment contributed

4


-----

approximately 4%, 6% and 8% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ancillary
services includes a diagnostic laboratory and multi-specialty physician practices.

� We offer physicians toxicology testing services through our wholly-owned diagnostic laboratory, based
in Tampa, Florida. Advanced toxicology screening provides physicians with the ability to identify when
a patient is taking too much of a prescribed substance, when a patient is non-compliant with a
prescribed substance or when a patient is taking unprescribed or illicit substances. Our diagnostic
laboratory offerings support the needs of our physicians across our existing specialties and new
service lines.

� We employ two models in connection with our network of multi-specialty physician practices. In the
state of Florida, where the law does not preclude a business corporation from employing physicians,
we own and operate Tampa Pain Relief Center, Inc., a wholly-owned business with several locations
throughout Florida. In states other than Florida, we operate physician practices pursuant to long-term
management service agreements with separate professional corporations that are wholly-owned by
physicians.

_Optical Services_
Our optical services segment contributed approximately 1% of our total revenue in each of 2018, 2017 and
2016.

_Sources of Revenue — Ancillary Services and Optical Services Segments_
The fees charged for services in our other segments depend on a variety of factors, including the type of
service provided, the location in which the service is provided and the provider of the service. Service fees
are received from both private and government third-party sources of payment. The amounts that we receive
in payment for the provision of ancillary and optical services may be adversely affected by market and cost
factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state
regulations cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third-party
payors.

Our ancillary services revenue primarily consists of fee for service revenue that is derived principally from
the provision of physician and laboratory services to patients of our surgical facilities. Medicare pays for
physician services based upon the MPFS. Payment rates under the MPFS are determined based on
(i) relative value units for the services provided, (ii) a geographic adjustment factor and (iii) a conversion
factor. Payment rates under the MPFS are updated annually by HHS. The primary element in each year’s
update calculation is the Medicare Economic Index (‘‘MEI’’), which is a measure of the inflation of the cost
of operating a physician practice. The update is then adjusted in conformity with the Medicare Access and
CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (‘‘MACRA’’), which was enacted in April 2015. MACRA established a
fixed 0.5% annual adjustment through calendar year 2018. Beginning in 2019, Medicare compensation to
physicians and physician practices will be subject to adjustment under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment
System (‘‘MIPS’’). Under MIPS, physicians will be assigned a composite performance score based on
measures of quality, resource use, meaningful use of electronic health records, and clinical practice
improvement activities. A threshold performance score will be set annually by CMS at the mean or median
of all composite scores for a prior annual performance period. Performance exceeding the threshold will
result in a positive adjustment, performance below the threshold will result in a negative adjustment, and
performance at the threshold will result in no adjustment. Physicians who participate in certain alternative
payment models, such as accountable care organizations, will be guaranteed a positive payment adjustment
under MACRA. The effect of the payment methodology changes under MACRA on our physician practices
cannot be predicted.

Certain of our laboratory ancillary services are reimbursed by Medicare under the Medicare Clinical
Laboratory Fee Schedule (‘‘CLFS’’). Under a June 23, 2016 final rule that implemented the Protecting
Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (‘‘PAMA’’), as of January 1, 2018 the CLFS payment methodology was
adjusted so that payment amounts for laboratory tests on the CLFS is determined by calculating a weighted

5


-----

median of private payor rates using reported private payor rates and associated volume (number of tests).
For tests that were paid on the CLFS prior to the implementation of PAMA, any reduction in payment
amount will be phased in over the first six years of payment under the new system.

**Acquisitions and Developments**

On August 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of NSH Holdco, Inc. for approximately $760 million,
adding NSH’s surgical facilities to our portfolio. At the same time, we completed the Transactions (as
defined below). In the last five years we have also completed the acquisition of Symbion, which materially
expanded our network of existing facilities and ancillary services.

_Acquisition Program._ In addition to our corporate strategy, we continuously evaluate opportunities to
expand our presence in the surgical facility market by making strategic acquisitions of existing surgical
facilities and by developing new surgical facilities in cooperation with local physician partners and, when
appropriate, healthcare systems and other strategic partners. We generally structure our partnerships as
two-way arrangements where either we are a majority owner partnered with physicians or we are a minority
owner with buy-up rights. These buy-up rights give us the option to own a controlling interest at some point
in the future. Alternatively, we may choose to pursue a three-way arrangement with physicians and a
healthcare system.

We employ a dedicated acquisition team with experience in healthcare services. Our team seeks to acquire
surgical facilities that meet our criteria, including prominence and quality of physician partners, specialty
mix, opportunities for growth, level of competition in the local market, level of managed care penetration
and our ability to access managed care organization contracts. We carefully evaluate each of our acquisition
opportunities through an extensive due diligence process to determine which facilities have the greatest
potential for growth and profitability improvements under our operating structure. Our team may also
identify opportunities to attract additional physicians to increase the acquired facility’s revenues and
profitability.

_Development Program._ We develop surgical facilities in markets that we identify as having substantial
interest by physicians and payors. We have experience in developing both single and multi-specialty surgical
facilities. When we develop a new surgical facility, we generally provide all of the services necessary to
complete the project. We offer in-house capabilities for structuring partnerships and financing facilities and
work with architects and construction firms in the design and development of surgical facilities. Before and
during the development phase of a new surgical facility, we analyze the competitive environment in the
local market, review market data to identify appropriate services to provide, prepare and analyze financial
forecasts, evaluate regulatory and licensing issues and assist in designing the surgical facility and
identifying appropriate equipment to purchase or lease. After the surgical facility is developed, we typically
provide general startup operational support, including information systems, equipment procurement and
financing.

**Recent Developments**

We entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below) documentation on the
date of this preliminary offering memorandum that provides for incremental revolving credit facility
commitments (the ‘‘2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments’’) which, immediately upon becoming
operative, will increase the outstanding commitments under the Revolver in an amount equal to
$45.0 million. The 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments will automatically become operative upon
satisfaction by the Issuer of certain conditions precedent set forth in the amendment to the Senior Secured
Facilities documentation providing for the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments, which the Issuer
expects to satisfy on or around the date that the notes are issued. The offering of notes hereby is not
conditioned on the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments becoming operative.

When we use the term ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA,’’ it is referring to net income minus (a) net income attributable to non-controlling
interests plus (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) equity-based compensation expense,
(e) contingent acquisition compensation expense, (f) transaction, integration and acquisition costs, (g) loss (gain) on litigation
settlements, (h) gain on acquisition escrow release, (i) loss (gain) on disposal and deconsolidations, net, (j) reserve adjustments,
(i) impairment charges, (k) gain on amendment to tax receivable agreement, (l) tax receivable agreement (benefit) expense and
(m) loss on debt refinancing. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key
measure used by our management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as
substitutes for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded
from this non-GAAP metric are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believe
such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to
the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.

We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum because we believe it is useful to investors in evaluating our
operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as their calculation eliminates the effects of
financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as these items may vary for different companies for
reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should not consider
Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows from operating activities or other operation statement or
cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table represents the reconciliation of Adjusted
EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Surgery Partners for the periods indicated below:

See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain
Non-GAAP Metrics.’’

When we use the term ‘‘Credit Agreement EBITDA,’’ we are referring to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined
above, further adjusted for acquisitions and non-cash expenses. These adjustments do not relate to our
historical financial performance and instead relate to estimates compiled by management and calculated
in accordance with the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ used in the credit agreement governing our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be
considered in isolation or as substitutes for cash flows from operating activities or any other measure
calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use Credit Agreement EBITDA as a measure of liquidity and to
determine our compliance under certain covenants pursuant to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Credit Agreement EBITDA is determined on a trailing twelve-month basis. We have included it because
we believe that it provides investors with additional information about our ability to incur and service
debt and make capital expenditures. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measurement of liquidity under
GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any other measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from Credit Agreement EBITDA are significant components in
understanding and evaluating our liquidity. Our calculation of Credit Agreement EBITDA may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk_
_factors as well as the other information and data included or incorporated by reference in this offering_
_memorandum prior to making an investment in the notes. The risks described below are not the only risks_
_we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be_
_immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results_
_of operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows,_
_financial condition or results of operations. In such case, you may lose all or part of your original_
_investment. Along with the risks and uncertainties described below, you should carefully consider the risks_
_and uncertainties described in the sections entitled ‘‘Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements’’ in_
_this offering memorandum and in Item 1A under the heading ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our 2018 10-K, which is_
_incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes and this Offering**

**Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling**
**our obligations under the notes.**

On an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as of
December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries would have had approximately $2.4 billion aggregate principal
amount of indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $1,453.4 million principal amount of the
Term Loan (as defined below) outstanding, $370.0 million principal amount of the 2025 Senior Unsecured
Notes (as defined below) outstanding and the notes offered hereby. As of December 31, 2018, we had no
outstanding revolving loan borrowings under our Revolver (as defined below), there were $3.8 million
principal amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Revolver, and we had $71.2 million of
unused commitments available to be borrowed under the Revolver. The 2019 Incremental Revolver
Commitments will increase the commitments under the Revolver to an aggregate amount equal to
$120.0 million. In addition to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes and
the notes, our aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding after giving effect to this offering
and the use of proceeds therefrom includes approximately $104.7 million of notes payable and capital
lease obligations primarily related to property and equipment for operations.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient
to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. In addition, subject to applicable restrictions under the
credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior
Unsecured Notes and the Indenture, we may incur significant additional indebtedness, which may be
secured, from time to time, which could have important consequences, including:

� making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including
the notes;

� making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive
conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;

� requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to making payments on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

� limiting our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic
conditions generally; and

� limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.

18


-----

**Despite our indebtedness level following this offering, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt.**
**This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.**

We will have the right to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including through entities
that are direct and indirect parents of the Issuer that will not guarantee the notes. The terms of the credit
agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior
Unsecured Notes and the Indenture will restrict, but will not in all circumstances prohibit us from doing so.
Under the instruments governing our debt, including the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur
substantial additional debt that ranks equal with the notes or that constitutes secured debt, including
borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any additional debt may be governed by agreements,
indentures or other instruments containing covenants that could place restrictions on the operation of our
business and the execution of our business strategy in addition to the restrictions on our business that will
already be contained in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture
governing the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes and the Indenture. Because any decision to issue debt
securities or enter into new debt facilities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future debt financings and
whether we may be required to accept unfavorable terms for any such financings.

**To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash**
**depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations may**
**adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund
working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the
future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative,
regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow or if future borrowings are not available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before the
maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any
of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our history of net losses may
impair our ability to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or repay outstanding amounts when they
become due. In addition, our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, will
depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of
our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, and
also might include incurring additional fees in connection with refinancing, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Indenture, may limit or
prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest
and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which
could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our
inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure
our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the notes.

**We may depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to fulfill our obligations under the notes.**

Our ability to service our debt obligations, including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of the
notes when due, may depend in part upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our
subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and
subject to any legal, contractual or other limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or
other distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation,

19


-----

other than under their applicable guarantees (if any) of the notes and their applicable guarantees of certain
(if any) other indebtedness, to make any funds available to us. In addition, under U.S. federal and foreign
bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state and foreign fraudulent transfer laws, the incurrence of
joint and several liability by our guarantors in respect of our obligations under the notes could be voided in
certain circumstances. Certain of our Restricted Subsidiaries are subject to Permitted Payment Restrictions
(as defined in the Description of Notes) that may limit their ability to make dividends and distributions in
respect of their Capital Stock (as defined in the Description of Notes) to Surgery Center Holdings or the
other Restricted Subsidiaries. While such restrictions must not materially impair our ability to pay scheduled
payments of cash interest and to make required principal payments on the notes, as determined at the
times set forth in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Payment Restrictions’’, and our operating agreements, subject
to certain exceptions, require that our Restricted Subsidiaries distribute excess cash to us, there can be no
assurances that over time none of the foregoing restrictions will ever constitute a material impediment to
our receipt of cash from our Restricted Subsidiaries and on our ability to make payments of principal and
interest on the notes.

**The Indenture will, and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the**
**indenture governing the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes do, restrict our current and future operations,**
**particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.**

The Indenture will, and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
indenture governing the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes do, impose significant operating and financial
restrictions and limit the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

� incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

� pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;

� prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

� make loans and investments;

� sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

� sell stock of our subsidiaries;

� incur liens;

� enter into transactions with affiliates;

� enter into agreements restricting certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

� consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As a result of these and other covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct our
business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to
take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, we may be required to maintain specified
financial maintenance ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future
indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able
to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive
covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time
could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay
these borrowings before their maturity. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable
terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**Your right to receive payments on the notes will be effectively subordinated to the right of lenders who have**
**a security interest in our assets to the extent of the value of those assets.**

Subject to the restrictions to be set forth in the Indenture, the Issuer and its subsidiaries may incur
significant additional indebtedness secured by their assets. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if
we default under any of our existing or future indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities

20


-----

that are secured by our assets, the holders of such indebtedness could declare all of the funds borrowed
thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such
indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could foreclose on such assets to the exclusion of holders
of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the Indenture at such time. Furthermore, if the holders
of such indebtedness foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any guarantor under the notes, then
that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such
sale. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by such assets or the equity interests in
guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied
or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. In addition, the Indenture
will permit us to incur additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes. Any such indebtedness
may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of assets available to satisfy holders of the
notes.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,453.4 million of outstanding Term Loan borrowings under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, there were $3.8 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolver, and we had
$71.2 million of unutilized capacity under the Revolver. The 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments will
increase the commitments under the Revolver to an amount equal to $120.0 million.

**The notes will be effectively subordinated to the claims of the creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries.**

We conduct a substantial portion of our business through our subsidiaries that will not be guarantors of our
obligations under the notes. Claims of creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
will generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of
our creditors, including holders of the notes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our
non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1.6 billion, or 89.0% of our revenue,
approximately $263.8 million, or 112.4%, of our Adjusted EBITDA, including intercompany transactions,
and as of December 31, 2018, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the offering and the use of
proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $747.5 million, or 16.0%,
of our consolidated assets, and approximately $377.2 million, or 13.0%, of our consolidated liabilities,
each excluding intercompany balances. The Indenture will permit the incurrence of certain additional
indebtedness by our non-guarantor subsidiaries in the future.

**Under certain circumstances a court could cancel the notes or the related guarantees under fraudulent**
**conveyance laws.**

The issuance of the notes and the related guarantees may be subject to review under federal or state
fraudulent transfer or conveyance law or similar laws. If the Issuer becomes a debtor in a case under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or encounters other financial difficulty, a court might avoid or cancel its obligations
under the notes. A court might do so if it found that, when the Issuer issued the notes, (i) it received less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (ii) the Issuer (1) was rendered insolvent, (2) was
left with inadequate capital to conduct its business or (3) believed or reasonably should have believed that
it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay. A court could also avoid the notes, without regard to factors
(i) and (ii), if it found that the Issuer issued the notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the
Issuer’s creditors.

Similarly, if one of the guarantors becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
encounters other financial difficulty, a court might avoid or cancel its guarantee if it finds that when such
guarantor issued its guarantee (or in some jurisdictions, when payments became due under the guarantee),
factors (i) and (ii) in the immediately preceding paragraph above applied to such guarantor, such guarantor
was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it
(if, in either case, after final judgment the judgment is unsatisfied), or, without regard to such factors
(i) and (ii), if it found that such guarantor issued its guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud
its creditors.

21


-----

In addition, a court could avoid or undo any payment by the Issuer or any guarantor pursuant to the notes
or a guarantee and require the disgorgement and return to the Issuer or guarantor of any payment or to a
fund for the benefit of the creditors of the Issuer or guarantor. In addition, under certain circumstances, a
court could subordinate rather than avoid obligations under the notes or the guarantees, and in that event,
the Issuer’s obligations under the notes or any such guarantor’s guarantee would be subordinated (including
structurally) to all of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s other debt. If the court were to avoid, cancel or
subordinate any guarantee, funds may not be available to pay the notes from another guarantor or from any
other source.

The test for determining solvency for purposes of the foregoing and below will vary depending on the law of
the jurisdiction being applied. In general, a court would consider an entity insolvent either if the sum of its
existing debts exceeds the fair value of all of its property, or its assets’ present fair saleable value is less
than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become due. For this
analysis, ‘‘debts’’ includes contingent and unliquidated debts. A court could also find that an entity was
insolvent if it either was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a
transaction, with unreasonably small capital, or it intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts
beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured.

The Indenture governing the notes will limit the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum
amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a
fraudulent transfer. This limitation will not necessarily protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer
challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice,
if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. It is not clear, however, whether those limits would
ultimately be adhered to or otherwise enforceable.

If a court avoided the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the obligations of all of the guarantors under
their guarantees, purchasers of the notes could cease to be the Issuer’s creditors or creditors of the
guarantors and would likely have no source from which to recover amounts due under the notes. Even if the
guarantee of a guarantor is not avoided as a fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to
that guarantor’s other debt, and in that event, the guarantees would be subordinated (including structurally)
to all of such guarantor’s other debt.

**We may be unable to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.**

Upon the occurrence of specified kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, together
with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.

However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make
the required repurchase of the notes. If we are required to repurchase the notes, we would probably require
third-party financing. We cannot be sure that we would be able to obtain third party financing on acceptable
terms, or at all.

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all of our assets. However, the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’ will likely be interpreted
under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances. As a result,
there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or disposition of ‘‘all or substantially
all’’ of our capital stock or assets has occurred, in which case, the ability of a holder of the notes to obtain
the benefit of an offer to repurchase all of a portion of the notes held by such holder may be impaired. See
‘‘Description of Notes — Change of Control.’’

It is also possible that the events that constitute a change of control may also be events of default under
our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These events may permit the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities
to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. If we are required to repurchase the notes pursuant

22


-----

to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities if such indebtedness is accelerated, we would probably require third-party financing. We cannot
be sure that we would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the
indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to
enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting our ability to raise
cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the
holders of the notes. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect
to transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes or other
specified events.

**If the notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, certain covenants contained**
**in the Indenture will be suspended, and you will lose the protection of these covenants unless or until the**
**ratings of the notes subsequently fall back below investment grade.**

The Indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that will be suspended for so long as the
notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. and no default or event of default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing on the
date of achieving such investment grade ratings. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our
restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:

� incur additional indebtedness;

� declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;

� create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting their subsidiaries;

� merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;

� enter into transactions with affiliates; and

� sell or transfer certain assets.

Because these restrictions will not apply when the notes are rated investment grade, we will be able to incur
additional debt and close transactions that may impair our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to
the notes. In addition, we will not have to make certain offers to repurchase the notes. These covenants will
only be restored if the credit ratings assigned to the notes later fall below investment grade.

**Ratings of the notes may affect the market price and marketability of the notes.**

The notes have been rated by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. These
ratings are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes, but
rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the
significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit
ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended
or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.
It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of
this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of notes will have no
recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such
ratings. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market
price or marketability of the notes.

**The transferability of the notes may be limited under applicable securities laws.**

The notes and the guarantees have not been registered, and we are under no obligation to register the notes
and the guarantees, under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction
and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the
applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. It is the obligation of the holders of the

23


-----

notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the notes within the United States and other countries comply
with applicable securities laws.

**Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active**
**trading market may not develop for the notes.**

The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We expect the
notes to be eligible for trading by ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ as defined under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, but we do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or include the
notes in any automated quotation system. The initial purchasers of the notes have advised us that they
intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial
purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and, if commenced, they may discontinue their
market-making activities at any time without notice.

We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for quotation through
an automated dealer quotation system. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be
maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In that case, the
holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. The
liquidity of any market for the notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

� the number of holders of notes;

� our operating performance and financial condition;

� the market for similar securities;

� the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes;

� prevailing interest rates; and

� the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes
may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that
market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the
notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the
market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**If we file a bankruptcy petition, or if a bankruptcy petition is filed against us, you may receive a lesser**
**amount for your claim under the notes than you would have been entitled to receive under the Indenture**
**governing the notes.**

If we file a bankruptcy petition under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the notes, or if such a
bankruptcy petition is filed against us, your claim against us for the principal amount of your notes may be
limited to an amount equal to:

� the original issue price for the notes; and

� the portion of original issue discount that does not constitute ‘‘unmatured interest’’ for purposes of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of any bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you may receive a lesser amount than you
would have been entitled to receive under the terms of the Indenture governing the notes, even if sufficient
funds are available.

24


-----

**The notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.**

The notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An
obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original issue discount if the stated redemption
price at maturity of the notes exceeds its issue price by at least a statutorily-defined de minimis amount. If
the notes are treated as issued with original issue discount, U.S. holders will be subject to tax on that
original issue discount on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the receipt of cash payments
attributable to that income regardless of the investors’ regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (and in addition to stated interest). See ‘‘Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations.’’

**The adjusted financial information presented in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance**
**with GAAP.**

The adjusted financial data included in this offering memorandum was prepared by applying certain
adjustments to the audited financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum. However, this adjusted financial data was not prepared using the principles that would be
applicable in preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Further, in certain sections of this
offering memorandum, we present Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Agreement EBITDA of the Company, and the
same limitations described above apply to such additional financial data.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds from this offering to be $430.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering, together with cash on our balance sheet, to (i) redeem all of our outstanding 2021
Senior Unsecured Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 8.875% per annum, (ii) pay the redemption
premium applicable to the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021
Senior Unsecured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption, and (iii) pay fees and expenses in

**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following selected consolidated historical financial information should be read in conjunction with
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and the audited
consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The selected consolidated
statements of operations data and cash flow data set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and the selected consolidated balance sheets data set forth below as of
December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are derived from our audited consolidated financial
statements for such periods. The timing of acquisitions and divestitures completed during the years
presented affects the comparability of the selected financial data. The following table covers periods both
prior to and subsequent to the Transactions. As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, in connection with the change of
control effected by the Private Sale, we elected to apply ‘‘pushdown’’ accounting. We have presented the
information for the year ended December 31, 2017 on a Predecessor period and Successor period
combined basis (each as defined in Note 1. ‘‘Organization and Summary of Accounting Policies’’ of our
consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum) to
facilitate meaningful comparisons of selected consolidated financial and other data to the prior year periods.
The following selected consolidated financial and other data should be read in conjunction with
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ in Item 7 and
our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which are incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum.

The historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
future period.

_the term ‘‘employees’’ refers to employees of affiliates of Surgery Partners._

**Executive Overview**

As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated a national network of surgical facilities, physician
practices and a suite of ancillary services in 31 states. Our surgical facilities, which include ASCs and
surgical hospitals, primarily provide non-emergency surgical procedures across many specialties, including,
among others, gastroenterology (‘‘GI’’), general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics and pain management.
Our surgical hospitals provide services, such as diagnostic imaging, laboratory, obstetrics, oncology,
pharmacy, physical therapy and wound care. Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented
by our suite of ancillary services, which support our physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient
patient care. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from rising consumerism and payors’
and patients’ focus on the delivery of high quality care and superior clinical outcomes in the lowest cost
and care setting.

As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated, primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of
123 surgical facilities comprised of 108 ASCs and 15 surgical hospitals across 31 states. We owned a
majority interest in 84 of the surgical facilities and consolidated 106 of these facilities for financial
reporting purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 521,000 surgical procedures
were performed in our surgical facilities, generating approximately $1.7 billion in revenue.

We continue to focus on improving our same-facility performance, selectively acquiring established facilities
and developing new facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired five surgical
facilities in new markets, two surgical facilities in existing markets, one of which was merged into an
existing facility and multiple physician practices for a total investment of $106.4 million. Further, during
the year ended December 31, 2018, we disposed of four surgery centers, two surgical hospitals and two
optical businesses for net cash proceeds of $18.7 million, and recognized a net pretax loss of
$21.2 million. This non-cash loss was primarily a result of the write-off of the net assets of the facility (net
of proceeds received) and was primarily driven by the write-off of the associated goodwill.

**Revenues**

Our revenues consist of patient service revenues and other service revenues. Patient service revenues
consist of revenue from our surgical facility services and ancillary services segments. Specifically, patient
service revenues include fees for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed at surgical facilities that we
consolidate for financial reporting purposes, as well as for patient visits to our physician practices,
anesthesia services, pharmacy services and diagnostic screens ordered by our physicians. Other service
revenues consist of product sales from our optical laboratories, which were sold in 2018, as well as the
discounts and handling charges billed to the members of our optical products purchasing organization.
Other service revenues also include management and administrative service fees derived from our
non-consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method, management of surgical facilities
and physician practices in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to
physician practices for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets.

The following table summarizes revenues by service type as a percentage of total revenues:

**_Surgical Case Mix_**
We primarily operate multi-specialty surgical facilities where physicians perform a variety of procedures in
various specialties. We believe this diversification helps to protect us from adverse pricing and utilization
trends in any individual procedure type and results in greater consistency in our case volume.

The following table sets forth the percentage of cases in each specialty performed at the surgical facilities
which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes:

**Year Ended December 31,**

**2018** **2017** **2016**

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our significant accounting policies and practices are described in Note 1 of our consolidated financial
statements, which are incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In preparing our
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(‘‘GAAP’’), we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities

33


-----

and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of
their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current
judgments and estimates. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following
critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and require our management’s subjective or complex judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods,
assumptions and estimates used. This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a
comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular
transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment regarding accounting
policy.

**_Consolidation and Control_**
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our Company, wholly-owned or controlled
subsidiaries and variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our controlled
subsidiaries consist of wholly-owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries that we control through our
ownership of a majority voting interest or other rights granted to us by contract to function as the sole
general partner or managing member of the surgical facility. The rights of limited partners or minority
members at our controlled subsidiaries are generally limited to those that protect their ownership interests,
including the right to approve the issuance of new ownership interests, and those that protect their financial
interests, including the right to approve the acquisition or divestiture of significant assets or the incurrence
of debt that either physician limited partners or minority members are required to guarantee on a pro-rata
basis based upon their respective ownership, or that exceeds 20.0% of the fair market value of the related
surgical facility’s assets. All significant intercompany balances and transactions, including management fees
from consolidated surgical facilities, are eliminated in consolidation.

**_Revenue Recognition_**
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued Accounting Standards Update
(‘‘ASU’’) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted the new standard effective
January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The presentation of the amount of earnings from
operations and net earnings were unchanged upon adoption of the new standard; however, during the year
of adoption, we determined that amounts historically considered to be bad debt should be considered an
implicit price concession, as defined in FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606, ‘‘Revenue From
_Contracts With Customers’’. This resulted in changes to the presentation of revenues and the provision for_
bad debts in the consolidated statements of operations. Previously, the estimate for unrealizable amounts
was recorded to the provision for bad debts and presented as a component of operating expenses. Upon
reassessment during the year of adoption, the estimate for unrealizable amounts is now reflected as an
implicit price concession as a reduction to arrive at net revenue. This change in presentation was not
material to the financial statements.

Our patient service revenues are derived from surgical procedures performed at our ASCs, patient visits to
physician practices, anesthesia services provided to patients, pharmacy services and diagnostic screens
ordered by our physicians. The fees for such services are billed either to the patient or a third-party payor,
including Medicare and Medicaid. We recognize patient service revenues, net of contractual allowances,
which we estimate based on the historical trend of our cash collections and contractual write-offs.

Our optical products purchasing organization negotiates volume buying discounts with optical product
manufacturers. The buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing
organization represent the revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes. Revenue is recognized as
orders are shipped to members. Product sale revenues from our optical laboratories and marketing products
and services businesses, net of an allowance for returns and discounts, is recognized when the product is
shipped or service is provided to the customer. We base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on
historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return
activity and discounts given.

34


-----

Other service revenues consist of management and administrative service fees derived from
non-consolidated surgical facilities that we account for under the equity method, management of surgical
facilities in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for
which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets. The fees we derive from these
management arrangements are based on a predetermined percentage of the revenues of each surgical
facility and physician network. We recognize other service revenues in the period in which services are
rendered.

**_Accounts Receivable_**
Our patient service revenues and other receivables from third-party payors are recorded net of estimated
implicit price concessions which are estimated based on the historical trend of our surgical facilities’ cash
collections and contractual write-offs, established fee schedules, relationships with payors and procedure
statistics. While changes in estimated reimbursement from third-party payors remain a possibility, we expect
that any such changes would be minimal and, therefore, would not have a material effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Our collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor, size of claim and estimated
collection percentage for each patient account. The operating systems used to manage our patient accounts
provide for an aging schedule in 30-day increments, by payor, physician and patient. We analyze accounts
receivable at each of our surgical facilities to ensure the proper collection and aged category. The operating
systems generate reports that assist in the collection efforts by prioritizing patient accounts. Collection
efforts include direct contact with insurance carriers or patients, written correspondence and the use of
legal or collection agency assistance, as required. Our days sales outstanding was 63 days for the year
ended December 31, 2018 and 61 days for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We recognize that final reimbursement of outstanding accounts receivable is subject to final approval by
each third-party payor. However, because we have contracts with our third-party payors and we verify the
insurance coverage of the patient before services are rendered, the amounts that are pending approval from
third-party payors are minimal. Amounts are classified outside of self-pay if we have an agreement with the
third-party payor or we have verified a patient’s coverage prior to services rendered. It is our policy to collect
co-payments and deductibles prior to providing services, where possible. It is also our policy to verify a
patient’s insurance 72 hours prior to the patient’s procedure. Because our services are primarily
non-emergency, our surgical facilities have the ability to control these procedures. Our patient service
revenues from self-pay payors as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 3% for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and 2% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

**_Income Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreement_**
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If a net operating
loss (‘‘NOL’’) carryforward exists, we make a determination as to whether that NOL carryforward will be
utilized in the future. A valuation allowance will be established for certain NOL carryforwards and other
deferred tax assets where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain. The carrying value of the net
deferred tax assets is based upon estimates and assumptions related to our ability to generate sufficient
future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the
future, we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2018, we had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards (‘‘NOLs’’) of
approximately $516.8 million. Under the Tax Act (as defined below), any U.S. federal NOLs arising in
taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 will carry forward indefinitely. However, NOLs arising in
taxable years ending before December 31, 2017 will still be subject to a carry forward limitation of

35


-----

20 years. Our unused NOLs expire in various amounts at varying times beginning in 2025. Unless they
expire, these NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our income taxes
otherwise payable.

We recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaling
$50.4 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The valuation allowance has been established for certain
deferred tax assets for which we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized,
which are primarily interest carryforwards under Section 163(j) (‘‘Section 163(j)’’) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), certain state net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. If
our expectations for future operating results on a consolidated basis or at the state jurisdiction level vary
from actual results due to changes in healthcare regulations, general economic conditions, or other factors,
we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets. Our income
tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases,
respectively, in our valuation allowance in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. These
changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Section 382 (‘‘Section 382’’) of the Code imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that
undergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ to use its NOLs to reduce its tax liability. An ‘‘ownership change’’ is
generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50.0% of a corporation’s ‘‘stock’’ by its
‘‘5-percent shareholders’’ (as defined in Section 382) over a rolling three-year period based upon each of
those shareholder’s lowest percentage of stock owned during such period. As a result of the Symbion
acquisition in 2014, approximately $179 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual
Section 382 base limitation of $4.9 million, and, as a result of the NovaMed acquisition in 2011,
approximately $17 million in NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of
$4.9 million. As a result of the NSH acquisition, approximately $20.5 million in NOL carryforwards are
subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $2.8 million. The Private Sale resulted in an ownership
change as defined in Section 382. As a result, approximately $461.2 million in NOL carryforwards are
subject to an annual Section 382 base limitation of $14.2 million. At this time, we do not believe this
limitation, when combined with amounts allowable due to net unrecognized built in gains, will affect our
ability to use any NOLs before they expire. However, no such assurances can be provided. If our ability to
utilize our NOLs to offset taxable income generated in the future is subject to this limitation, it could have
an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ‘‘Tax Act’’) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly affected
U.S. federal income tax law. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act reduces the
U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for 100% expensing of certain capital
expenditures, and limits certain interest expense deductions. The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which
provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period
that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the
accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of
those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Our accounting for the
following elements of the Tax Act is complete: reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to
21%, 100% expensing of capital expenditures, and the interest expense limitation under Section 163(j).

_Tax Receivable Agreement_
On May 9, 2017, we entered into an agreement to amend our Income Tax Receivable Agreement, dated
September 30, 2015 (as amended, the ‘‘TRA’’), between the Company, and the other parties referred to
therein, which amendment became effective on August 31, 2017. Pursuant to the amendment to the TRA,
we agreed to make payments to H.I.G., our former controlling shareholder, in its capacity as the
stockholders representative pursuant to a fixed payment schedule. The amounts payable under the TRA are
calculated as the product of (i) an annual base amount and (ii) the maximum corporate federal income tax
rate for the applicable year plus three percent. The amounts payable under the TRA are related to our
projected realized tax savings over the next five years and are not dependent on our actual tax savings.

36

Amounts payable pursuant to the TRA will be adjusted downward in the event that the maximum corporate
federal income tax rate is reduced. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA and
such inability is a result of the terms of credit agreements and other debt documents that are materially
more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred and will
accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid. If the terms of such credit agreements
and other debt documents cause us to be unable to make payments under the TRA and such terms are not
materially more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred
and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points until paid. As a result of the amendment
to the TRA, we were required to value the liability under the TRA by discounting the fixed payment
schedule using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

Assuming our tax rate is 24%, calculated as the maximum corporate federal tax rate plus three percent,
throughout the remaining term of the TRA, we estimate the total remaining amounts payable under the TRA
are approximately $64.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The carrying value of the liability under the
TRA, reflecting the discount as discussed above, was $48.5 million as of December 31, 2018

**_Impairment of Goodwill_**
We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if certain indicators
arise. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below an
operating segment. As of October 1, 2018, we have identified three reporting units, which include the
following: 1) Surgical Facilities, 2) Ancillary Services, and 3) The Alliance, including Optical Synergies
(‘‘Alliance’’). The Alliance is a component of our Optical Services operating segment. In 2018, we disposed
of two previously identified reporting units, Midwest Labs and Family Vision Care.

We compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit. To determine the fair value of the reporting units, we obtained valuations at the reporting
unit level prepared by third-party valuation specialists. This valuation is based on a combination of
conventional income and market valuation calculations. The discounted cash flow (‘‘DCF’’) model that is
used in our income valuation is projected based on a year-by-year assessment that considers historical
results, estimated market conditions, internal projections, and relevant publicly available statistics.
Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including assumptions about
appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans
aligned with provided guidance and, when applicable, various growth rates are assumed for years beyond
the current business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk
inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. The variables within the discount rate,
many of which are outside of our control, provide the best estimate of all assumptions applied within the
DCF model. There can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the
projections. In determining the fair value under the market approaches, the analysis includes a control
premium, which was based on observable market data and a review of selected transactions of companies
that operate in our sector. While we believe that all assumptions utilized in the testing were appropriate,
they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Specific factors that could negatively impact the
assumptions used include changes to the discount and growth rates and a change in the equity and
enterprise premiums being realized in the market.

As of October 1, 2018, prior to our impairment testing, our three reporting units with allocated goodwill
were as follows: 1) Surgical Facilities — $3.3 billion, 2) Ancillary Services — $80.0 million, and 3) The
Alliance, including Optical Synergies (‘‘Alliance’’) — $25.3 million. As of the October 1, 2018 valuation,
the fair value for the Surgical Facilities reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. For
the Ancillary Services and Alliance reporting units, the carrying value exceeded the fair value, resulting in
non-cash impairment charges of $60.7 million and $13.7 million, respectively.

37


-----

As a result of the impairment charges, the fair value equaled carrying value as of October 1, 2018 for the
Ancillary Services and Alliance reporting units, any future adverse events or changes in the assumptions
could require additional impairment. Subsequent to the date of our annual impairment test, we considered
our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, and
other market indicators including our market capitalization. Based on our evaluation of all such factors, we
concluded that an event had not occurred or circumstances had not changed that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying values.

In connection with the implementation of pushdown accounting, we performed our goodwill impairment test
as of August 31, 2017, then re-evaluated for impairment at October 1, 2017. Both evaluations resulted in
no impairment.

**_Equity-Based Compensation_**
Transactions in which the Company receives employee and non-employee services in exchange for the
Company’s equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company’s equity
securities or may be settled by the issuance of these securities are accounted for using a fair value method.
The fair value of future stock options awarded will be based on the quoted market price of our common
stock upon grant, as well as assumptions including expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate,
expected dividends, and expected term.

Our policy is to recognize compensation expense using the straight line method over the relevant vesting
period for units that vest based on time. Our equity-based compensation expense can vary in the future
depending on many factors, including levels of forfeitures and whether performance targets are met and
whether a liquidity event occurs. Our board of directors and stockholders adopted the Surgery Partners, Inc.
2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan from which our future equity-based awards will be granted.

_Revenues._ Revenues for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2018** **2017**

Patient service revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,736,975 $1,320,211
Optical service revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,545 11,115
Other service revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24,936 9,893

Total revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,771,456 $1,341,219

Patient service revenues increased 31.6% to $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $1.3 billion in 2017,
primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of NSH. The increase in other service revenues is primarily due to an
increase in management and administrative service fees derived from non-consolidated surgical facilities
that we account for under the equity method and management of surgical facilities in which we do not own
an interest, primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of NSH. Additionally, total revenues in 2018 reflect the
impact of our adoption of ASU 2014-09 as discussed in ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies — Revenue
_Recognition’’ above._

_Cost of Revenues._ Cost of revenues were $1.4 billion in 2018 compared to $1.0 billion in 2017, with the
increase in costs primarily attributable to our 2018 and 2017 acquisitions and an increase in supply costs
associated with higher acuity surgical case volume. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues were
76.9% and 75.6% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $93.6 million and
$76.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in these expenses is primarily attributable to
the acquisition of NSH, but also reflects increases in equity-based compensation, rent costs and general
inflation. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 5.3% in 2018 compared
to 5.7% in 2017. This increase includes $7.0 million attributable to the acquisition of NSH, which was
included in our operations for four months of 2017 but for all 12 months of 2018.

_Depreciation and Amortization._ Depreciation and amortization was $67.4 million and $51.9 million in
2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2018 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of NSH. As a
percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses were 3.8% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2017.

_Provision for Doubtful Accounts._ As described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements
incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2018,
which resulted in a change in recognition of our provision for doubtful accounts. Beginning in 2018, we
considered such amounts as implicit price concessions and recorded that estimate as a component of
reported revenue. Prior periods were not reclassified based on the modified retrospective transition method
adopted by the Company.

_Income from Equity Investments._ Income from equity investments was $8.9 million and $6.5 million in
2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is attributed the four equity method investments that were
included in the acquisition of NSH.

_Loss on Disposals and Deconsolidations, Net._ The net loss on disposals and deconsolidations was
$31.8 million in 2018, which included a net loss of $20.1 million on the disposal of six surgical facilities
and our optical laboratory, and the deconsolidation of a surgical facility. The remaining loss is related to
disposals of other long-lived assets. The net loss on disposals and deconsolidations in 2017 was
attributable to disposals of other long-lived assets.

40


-----

_Transaction and Integration Costs._ We incurred $31.7 million of transaction and integration costs in 2018
compared to $13.1 million in 2017, as a majority of integration costs were incurred in 2018 for the NSH
acquisition as well as other acquisitions that occurred in 2018 (refer to notes to consolidated financial
statements for additional detail).

_Impairment charges._ As described in the Critical Accounting Policies section above, in 2018 we recorded
a non-cash impairment charge of $60.7 million and $13.7 million for goodwill assigned to our Ancillary
Services and Alliance reporting units, respectively. This charge was warranted based on the calculated fair
value compared to the carrying value of these reporting units.

_Loss on Debt Refinancing._ In 2017, we incurred a loss on debt refinancing of $18.2 million. The 2017
loss includes the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the
prepayment and termination of our then-existing senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured
term loan facility and a portion of costs incurred with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

_Loss (Gain) on Litigation Settlement._ We incurred a loss on a potential resolution of an investigation in the
amount of $46.0 million in 2018 related to the government investigation discussed in Item 3. ‘‘Legal
Proceedings’’ in our 2018 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In
2017, we recorded a gain of $12.5 million related to legal settlements reached in 2017.

_Tax Receivable Agreement._ In 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement gain of $16.4 million
primarily as a result of the amendment of the TRA. No such gain occurred in 2018. Also in 2017, we
recognized a tax receivable agreement benefit of $25.3 million related to a reduction in the corporate tax
rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We did not incur a tax receivable agreement benefit in 2018.

_Interest Expense, Net._ Interest expense, net, increased to $147.0 million in 2018 compared to
$117.7 million in 2017. The increase primarily relates to the issuance of our $370 million Senior
Unsecured Notes on June 30, 2017 due 2025 and an increase in our variable rate debt due to the
refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of August 31, 2017. Additionally, we entered into an
incremental term loan amendment to provide for a $180.0 million senior secured incremental term loan,
which was fully drawn on October 23, 2018. As a percentage of revenues, interest expense, net was 8.3%
in 2018 compared to 8.8% in 2017.

_Income Tax Expense (Benefit)._ Income tax expense was $26.5 million and $53.6 million in 2018 and
2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was (38.3)% for 2018 compared to 65.1% in 2017. The change
in effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the tax-effect of the non-deductible goodwill impairment
and the valuation allowance that was recorded related to the 163(j) interest deferred tax asset.

_Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests._ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
was $110.1 million and $81.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in this amount is
predominantly due to the inclusion of NSH for the full-year of 2018. As a percentage of revenues, net
income attributable to non-controlling interests was 6.2% in the 2018 period and 6.1% for the 2017
period.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016_**
_Overview._ During 2017, our revenues increased 17.1% to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in 2016. We
incurred net loss attributable to Surgery Partners, Inc. in 2017 of $53.0 million, compared to income of
$9.5 million in 2016.

Patient service revenues increased 17.4% to $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. This
increase in patient service revenues was primarily attributable to the 2017 acquisition of NSH.

_Cost of Revenues._ Cost of revenues were $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to $821.2 million in 2016. The
increase is primarily attributable to our 2017 and 2016 acquisitions, and an increase in supply costs due
to a higher acuity surgical case volume. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues were 75.6% and
71.7% for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

_General and Administrative Expenses._ General and administrative expenses were $76.0 million and
$60.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of
NSH, but also reflects increases in equity-based compensation expense, rent costs, contingent acquisition
compensation expense and general inflation. The remaining increase is attributable to overall growth of the
business. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 5.7% for the 2017 period
compared to 5.3% for the 2016 period.

_Depreciation and Amortization._ Depreciation and amortization was $51.9 million and $39.6 million in
2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of NSH, and the
remeasurement of assets at fair value in connection with the application of pushdown accounting. As a
percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses were 3.9% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2016.

_Provision for Doubtful Accounts._ The provision for doubtful accounts was $28.8 million in 2017 compared
to $24.2 million in 2016. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of NSH. As a percentage of
revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts was 2.1% for both 2017 and 2016.

_Income from Equity Investments._ Income from equity investments was $6.5 million and $4.8 million in
2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is attributed to the four equity method investments that were
included in the acquisition of NSH.

_Loss on Disposals and Deconsolidations, Net._ The net loss on disposals and deconsolidations was
$1.7 million and $2.4 million 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was attributable to disposals of other
long-lived assets for both periods.

_Transaction and Integration Costs._ We incurred $13.1 million of transaction and integration costs in 2017
compared to $8.7 million in 2016. The increase relates to the Transactions on August 31, 2017, as well as
other acquisitions that occurred in 2017.

_Loss on Debt Refinancing._ We incurred $18.2 million as a loss on debt refinancing in 2017 compared to
$11.9 million in 2016. The 2017 loss includes the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and
discount related to the prepayment of the then-existing senior secured revolving credit facility and senior

42


-----

secured term loan facility and a portion of costs incurred with entering into the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities.

_Gain on Litigation Settlement._ We recorded a gain on litigation settlement of $12.5 million in 2017
compared to $14.1 million in 2016. These items related to a legal settlements for the year in which the
settlements were reached.

_Tax Receivable Agreement._ In 2017, we recognized a tax receivable agreement gain of $16.4 million
primarily as a result of the amendment of the TRA. No such gain occurred in 2016. Also in 2017, we
recognized a tax receivable agreement benefit of $25.3 million related to a reduction in the corporate tax
rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2016 expense was recorded to update the initial estimated
liability for the filed tax returns and final 2015 tax losses that are included in the amounts payable under
the TRA.

_Interest Expense, Net._ Interest expense, net, increased to $117.7 million in 2017 compared to
$100.6 million in 2016. The increase primarily relates to the issuance of our $370 million Senior
Unsecured Notes on June 30, 2017 due 2025 and the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility as
of August 31, 2017.

_Income Tax Expense (Benefit)._ Income tax expense was $53.6 million and $7.1 million in 2017 and
2016, respectively. The effective tax rate was 65.1% for 2017 and 7.7% for 2016. The change in effective
tax rate was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the
enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

_Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests._ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
was $81.7 million and $75.6 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is attributable to the
acquisition of NSH. As a percentage of revenues, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was
6.1% in 2017 and 6.6% in 2016.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Operating Activities_**
The primary source of our operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from federal and state
agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance
companies and individuals. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $144.6 million, $120.9 million
and $125.2 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in operating cash flow in 2018 is
primarily attributed to the additional revenue contribution from our 2017 acquisition of NSH plus other
2018 acquisitions, partially offset by integration costs and a decline in the performance of our ancillary
business. The decline in operating cash flow for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily related to the
decline in performance of our ancillary business.

**_Investing Activities_**
Net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was $128.9 million, which included $39.8 million related to
purchases of property and equipment. We paid $106.8 million, in cash for acquisitions (net of cash
acquired), which included five surgical facilities in new markets, two surgical facilities in an existing
market, one of which was merged into an existing facility and multiple physician practices. Further, we
received $19.2 million in proceeds from disposals of six surgical facilities and our optical laboratory.

Net cash used in investing activities in 2017 was $783.4 million, which included $29.6 million related to
purchases of property and equipment. We paid $755.1 million in cash for acquisitions (net of cash
acquired), of which $711.7 million related to the acquisition of NSH. The remaining amount included the
acquisitions of four physician practices and one surgical facility. Further, we received $1.3 million in
proceeds from the disposal of a surgical facility.

Net cash used in investing activities in 2016 was $184.7 million, which included $39.1 million related to
purchases of property and equipment. We paid $146.4 million in cash for acquisitions (net of cash
acquired), of which $129.8 million, excluding the $16.6 million of contingent acquisition consideration,
related to the purchase of six surgical facilities, one of which was merged with an existing facility, three
anesthesia practices, eleven physician practices, a lab and a pharmacy. Further, we received $0.8 million in
proceeds from the disposal of a surgical facility.

**_Financing Activities_**
Net cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $6.3 million. During this period, we made distributions
to non-controlling interest holders of $109.0 million and payments related to ownership transactions with
consolidated affiliates of $2.2 million. Further, we made repayments on our long-term debt of
$157.6 million offset by borrowings of $282.7 million, which included incremental term loan borrowings of
$180.0 million. In connection with the incremental term loan, we made payments of debt issuance costs of
$3.0 million. In addition, we made preferred dividend payments of $7.8 million and repurchased
$2.0 million of our common stock pursuant to our $50 million repurchase program announced on
December 15, 2017.

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was $767.7 million. During this period, we made
distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $83.8 million and payments related to ownership
transactions with consolidated affiliates of $0.5 million. Further, we made repayments on our long-term
debt of $1.2 billion offset by borrowings of $1.8 billion. In addition, we made payments of debt issuance
costs of $58.6 million and received proceeds on the issuance of preferred stock of $291.7 million, net of
issuance costs, and repurchased $2.0 million of our common stock pursuant to our $50 million repurchase
program announced on December 15, 2017.

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $71.3 million. During this period, we made
distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $65.8 million and payments related to ownership
transactions with consolidated affiliates of $20.1 million. Further, we made repayments on our long-term
debt of $473.4 million offset by borrowings of $650.7 million. In addition, we made payments of debt
issuance costs of $14.3 million and a penalty on the prepayment of debt of $4.9 million during the period.

**_Long-Term Debt_**
As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our total indebtedness, including capital leases, was
$2.326 billion, which includes net unamortized fair value premium of $1.2 million and unamortized
deferred financing costs of $2.9 million.

_Senior Secured Credit Facilities_
As of December 31, 2018, we had Term Loan borrowings with a carrying value of $1.448 billion, consisting
of outstanding aggregate principal of $1.453 billion and unamortized fair value discount of $5.5 million. In
2018, we entered into an incremental term loan amendment, which amended and supplemented the Credit
Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2017 (the ‘‘Credit Agreement’’), to provide for an incremental borrowing
of $180.0 million. The incremental amounts were fully drawn on October 23, 2018, and the proceeds
thereof were used to fund acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The incremental borrowings
bear interest and is subject to maturity, amortization and other terms consistent with the existing term loans
outstanding as disclosed below.

The Term Loan matures on August 31, 2024 (or, if at least 50.0% of the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes
shall have not either been repaid or refinanced with permitted indebtedness having a maturity date not
earlier than six months after the maturity date of the Term Loan by no later than October 15, 2020, then
October 15, 2020). The Term Loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate
original principal amount of the Term Loan.

We have a Revolver providing for revolving borrowings of up to $75.0 million (and, upon the effectiveness of
the 2019 Incremental Revolving Commitments (as defined below), we will have a revolving credit facility

44


-----

providing commitments for revolving borrowings of up to $120.0 million). The Revolver will mature on
August 31, 2022 (or, if at least 50.0% of the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes have not either been repaid or
refinanced with permitted indebtedness having a maturity date not earlier than six months after the maturity
date of the Term Loan by no later than October 15, 2020, then October 15, 2020). As of December 31,
2018, our availability on the Revolver (without giving effect to the 2019 Incremental Revolving
Commitments) was $71.2 million (with outstanding letters of credit of $3.8 million).

The Revolver may be utilized for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.
Subject to certain conditions and requirements set forth in the credit agreement, we may request one or
more additional incremental term loan facilities or one or more increases in the commitments under the
Revolver.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) LIBOR plus a margin
ranging from 3.00% to 3.25% per annum, depending on our first lien net leverage ratio or (y) an alternate
base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) 0.5% per annum above the federal funds
effective rate and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum (solely with respect to the Term Loan, the
alternate base rate shall not be less than 2.00% per annum)) plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%
per annum. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum in respect of
unused commitments under the Revolver.

_Senior Unsecured Notes_
We have senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2021 with a carrying value of $406.7 million as of
December 31, 2018. The 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.875% per year,
payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year.

We have $370.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2025
outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes bear interest at the rate of
6.750% per year, payable semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year.

_Other Debt_
We and certain of our subsidiaries have other debt consisting of outstanding bank indebtedness of
$79.3 million, which is collateralized by the real estate and equipment owned by the surgical facilities to
which the loans were made, and capital lease obligations of $25.4 million for which we are liable to various
vendors for several property and equipment leases classified as capital leases.

_Summary_
We believe we have sufficient liquidity in the next 12 to 18 months as described above. Nevertheless, we
continue to monitor the state of the financial and credit markets and our current and expected liquidity and
capital resource needs, and intend to continue to explore various financing alternatives to improve our
capital structure, including reducing debt, extending maturities or relaxing financial covenants. These may
include new equity or debt financings or exchange offers with existing security holders (including exchanges
of debt for debt or equity) and other transactions involving our outstanding securities, given their secondary
market trading prices. We cannot assure you, if we pursue any of these transactions, that we will be
successful in completing a transaction on attractive terms, or at all.

**Certain Non-GAAP Metrics**

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from this non-GAAP metric are significant components in
understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believe such adjustments are appropriate, as
the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of
normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures reported by other companies.

-----

When we use the term ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’, we are referring to income before income taxes, adjusted for net
income attributable to non-controlling interests, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, equitybased compensation expense, contingent acquisition compensation expense, transaction, integration and
acquisition costs, loss (gain) on litigation settlements, gain on acquisition escrow release, loss on disposals
and deconsolidations, net, reserve adjustments, impairment charges, gain on amendment to tax receivable
agreement, tax receivable agreement (benefit) expense and loss on debt refinancing. We use Adjusted
EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our
management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources.

The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to (loss) income before income taxes, the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands and unaudited):

(1) This amount includes transaction and integration costs of $31.7 million, $13.1 million and $8.7 million in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively, and acquisition costs of $2.2 million, $3.9 million and $2.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

(2) This amount represents adjustments to revenue in connection with applying consistent policies across the combined
company as a result of the integration of Surgery Partners and NSH.

We use Credit Agreement EBITDA as a measure of liquidity and to determine our compliance under certain
covenants pursuant to our credit facilities. Credit Agreement EBITDA is determined on a trailing twelvemonth basis. We have included it because we believe that it provides investors with additional information
about our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not
a measurement of liquidity under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any
other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from Credit Agreement EBITDA are
significant components in understanding and evaluating our liquidity. Our calculation of Credit Agreement
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

When we use the term ‘‘Credit Agreement EBITDA,’’ we are referring to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above,
further adjusted for acquisitions and non-cash expenses. These adjustments do not relate to our historical
financial performance and instead relate to estimates compiled by management and calculated in
conformance with the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ used in the credit agreements governing our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

revenue synergies from other business initiatives calculated in accordance with the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ used
in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

(1) Included in long-term debt obligations are principal and interest owed on our outstanding debt obligations. These amounts
exclude our unamortized fair value adjustments related non-cash amortization for the Term Loan and 2021 Senior Unsecured
Notes. These obligations are explained further in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by
reference into this offering memorandum. We used the applicable annual interest rate as of December 31, 2018 of 5.6%,
based on LIBOR plus the applicable margin, for our $1.5 billion outstanding Term Loan to estimate interest payments on
this variable rate debt instrument.

(2) This reflects our future minimum operating lease payments. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business.
Substantially all of our operating lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease
agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we
exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. These obligations are
explained further in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which
we are also obligated to pay.

(3) Other financing obligations includes amounts due under our facility lease obligations at four of our surgical facilities as
discussed further in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum.

Inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which
we operate.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

Please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into
this offering memorandum, for a discussion of the impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting
standards and accounting standards not yet adopted.

**PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Surgery
Center Holdings, Inc. is indirectly owned by Surgery Partners, Inc., and approximately 65.9% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of Surgery Partners, Inc. is indirectly owned by investment funds advised by
affiliates of Bain Capital.

**RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS**

The following is a description of transactions, since January 1, 2018, in which (a) we are a participant,
(b) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (c) one or more of our executive officers, directors, director
nominees or 5% stockholders, or their immediate family members, each of whom we refer to as a ‘‘related
person,’’ has a direct or indirect material interest. We refer to these as ‘‘related person transactions.’’

**Tax Receivable Agreement and related waivers**

In connection with Bain Capital’s purchase of 26,455,651 shares of our common stock from our former
controlling shareholder in 2017 the Company entered into an amendment to its Income Tax Receivable
Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 (as amended, the ‘‘Amended TRA’’), among the Company, the
Stockholders Representative and the other parties referred to therein which amendment became effective on
August 31, 2017. Pursuant to the Amended TRA, the Company agreed to make payments to H.I.G. Surgery
Centers, LLC, in its capacity as the stockholders representative pursuant to a fixed payment schedule. The
amounts payable under the Amended TRA are calculated as the product of (i) an annual base amount and
(ii) the maximum corporate federal income tax rate for the applicable year plus three percent. The amounts
payable under the Amended TRA are related to the Company’s projected realized tax savings over the next
six years and are not dependent on the Company’s actual tax savings over such period. The calculation of
amounts payable pursuant to the Amended TRA is thus dependent on the maximum corporate federal
income tax rate. To the extent that the Company is unable to make payments under the Amended TRA and
such inability is a result of the terms of credit agreements and other debt documents that are materially
more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such payments will be deferred and will
accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid. If the terms of such credit agreements
and other debt documents cause the Company to be unable to make payments under the Amended TRA
and such terms are not materially more restrictive than those existing as of September 30, 2015, such
payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points until paid.

**Registration Rights Agreement**

In connection with Bain Capital’s purchase of 310,000 shares of our preferred stock in 2017, we entered
into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the ‘‘Registration Rights Agreement’’) with
certain stockholders of the Company and certain other parties thereto, including Bain Capital. Pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a registration statement for a public
offering of shares upon the request of Bain Capital and certain of its affiliates, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the registrable
shares held by the parties to the Registration Rights Agreement, subject to certain limitations as described
in the Registration Rights Agreement, including a minimum net aggregate offering price and a limitation on
the number of registrations the Company shall be required to effect. The Company also agreed to provide
‘‘piggy back,’’ ‘‘short-form’’ and shelf registration rights with respect to such registrable shares, each as
described in the Registration Rights Agreement.

**Consulting Services Agreement**

On August 31, 2018 we entered into a Consulting Services Agreement with Bain Capital Private Equity, LP,
the advisor to BCPE Seminole Holdings LP, which we refer to as the Consultant, pursuant to which the
Consultant provides us with certain business consulting services and strategic advice. In exchange for these
services, we pay the Consultant an annual aggregate fee of $500,000, paid quarterly in advance. In
addition, the Consultant was entitled to a one time fee in respect of integration services provided in respect
of BCPE Seminole Holdings LP’s initial investment $500,000, which was paid as of the date of the
agreement. We also reimburse the Consultant for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
provision of the consulting services. The Consulting Services Agreement includes customary exculpation and
indemnification provisions in favor of the Consultant and its affiliates. The initial term of the Consulting

52


-----

Services Agreement is three years and thereafter automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless
180 days’ notice is given by either party.

**Indemnification Agreements**

We entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers subsequent to
our initial public offering. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals and, in certain cases,
affiliates of such individuals, to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware law against liabilities that
may arise by reason of their service to us or at our direction, and to advance expenses incurred as a result
of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.

**Consulting Agreements**

In connection with leadership changes during 2018, we entered into consulting agreements with each of
Teresa F. Sparks and Clifford G. Adlerz. For further information regarding such agreements, see the
disclosures set forth in ‘‘Executive Compensation — Leadership Changes’’ and ‘‘Executive Compensation —
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control’’ in our Proxy Statement for our 2018 annual
meeting.

**Related Person Transactions Policy**

We have adopted a formal written policy with respect to the review, approval and ratification of related
person transactions. Under the policy, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving
related person transactions. In the course of its review and approval of related person transactions, our
Audit Committee considers the relevant facts and circumstances to decide whether to approve such
transactions, including, but not limited to:

� the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director or an immediate
family member of the director;

� the benefits to us of the proposed transaction;

� if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;

� the terms of the transaction; and

� the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally.

The Audit Committee may also include such factors as: the related person’s relationship to us and interest
in the transaction, and the material facts of the proposed transaction, including the proposed aggregate
value of the transaction. The Audit Committee may approve only those transactions that are in, or are not
inconsistent with, our best interests and those of our stockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in
good faith.

time to time listed under the section entitled ‘‘Where You Can Find More Information’’ included in this
offering memorandum.

**Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolver**

**_General_**
The Issuer is the borrower under a $1,470.0 million senior secured term loans (the ‘‘Term Loan’’) and a
revolving credit facility of $75.0 million (which, upon the 2019 Incremental Revolving Commitments
becoming operative, will be increased to $120.0 million) (the ‘‘Revolver’’ and, together with the Term Loan,
the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Facilities’’). Proceeds of the Revolver may be utilized for working capital, capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes

As of December 31, 2018, the Term Loan had a carrying value of $1,448.0 million, consisting of
outstanding aggregate principal of $1,453.4 million and unamortized fair value discount of $5.5 million. As
of December 31, 2018, the Issuer’s undrawn availability on the Revolver was $71.2 million.

**_Incremental Facilities_**
The Issuer is permitted to, at its option and subject to certain conditions and requirements set forth in the
documentation governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, request one or more incremental term loan
facilities or one or more increases in the commitments under the Revolver, respectively, in an aggregate
amount up to (i) $346.0 million (of which $35.0 million may only be used for one or more increases in
commitments under the Revolver, and the remainder of which may be used for either one or more
incremental term loan facilities or one or more increases in the commitments under the Revolver), plus
(ii) an unlimited additional amount, so long as under this clause (ii) only, on a pro forma basis after the
incurrence of such amount (A) if such incremental facility ranks pari passu in right of security on the
collateral with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the first lien net leverage ratio as
of the last day of the most recently ended test period does not exceed 3.90:1.00 and (B) if such
incremental facility ranks junior in right of security on the collateral to the obligations under the Term Loan
and Revolver, the senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended test period
does not exceed 3.90:1.00.

The Term Loan includes an incremental term loan in original principal amount of $180.0 million previously
incurred pursuant to (and in corresponding utilization of) the $346.0 million incremental facilities basket
referenced in the foregoing sentence. However, the Issuer may in the future re-classify such incremental
term loan as having been incurred pursuant to the unlimited incremental facilities amount referenced in the
foregoing sentence subject to compliance with the applicable leverage ratio (and, from and after such time,
such incremental term loan shall not be deemed to have been incurred in utilization of capacity under the
$346.0 million incremental facilities basket referenced in the foregoing sentence).

We entered into the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments, which, immediately upon becoming
operative, will increase the outstanding commitments under the Revolver in an amount equal to
$45.0 million. The 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments will automatically become operative upon
satisfaction by the Issuer of certain conditions precedent set forth in the amendment to the Senior Secured
Facilities documentation providing for the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments, which the Issuer
expects to satisfy on or around the date that the Notes are issued. The offering of notes hereby is not
conditioned on the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments becoming operative. The 2019 Incremental

54


-----

Revolver Commitments, once operative, will be initially incurred pursuant to (and in corresponding
utilization of) the $346.0 million incremental facilities basket referenced above. However, the Issuer may in
the future re-classify such 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments as having been incurred pursuant to
the unlimited incremental facilities amount referenced above subject to compliance with the applicable
leverage ratio (and, from and after such time, the 2019 Incremental Revolver Commitments shall not be
deemed to have been incurred in utilization of capacity under the $346.0 million incremental facilities
basket referenced above).

**_Interest and Fees_**
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) adjusted LIBOR (which
adjusted LIBOR, solely with respect to the Term Loan, is subject to a minimum of 1.00% per annum) plus
a margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.25% per annum, depending on our first lien net leverage ratio or (y) an
alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) 0.5% per annum above the federal
funds effective rate and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum) (which alternate base rate,
solely with respect to the Term Loan, is subject to a minimum of 2.00% per annum) plus a margin ranging
from 2.00% to 2.25% per annum.

In addition, on the last business day of each calendar quarter the Issuer is required to pay a commitment
fee of 0.50% per annum in respect of unused commitments under the Revolver. The Issuer is also subject
to customary letter of credit and agency fees in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**_Prepayments_**
The Term Loan requires mandatory prepayments, subject to the right of reinvestment and certain other
exceptions, in amounts equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and casualty and
condemnation events. The Term Loan requires mandatory prepayments, subject to certain exceptions, in
amounts equal to 100% of the net proceeds of certain indebtedness the incurrence of which was not
permitted under the Term Loan at the time incurred. The Term Loan also requires an annual mandatory
prepayment of the Term Loan in an amount equal to a percentage of excess cash flow for the applicable
fiscal year that depends on the first lien net leverage ratio for the four fiscal quarter period ending as of the
last day of each such fiscal year.

Voluntary prepayment of a Term Loan and reductions of Revolver commitments is permitted, in whole or in
part, with prior notice, without premium or penalty (except LIBOR breakage costs) in minimum amounts as
set forth in the Term Loan and Revolver.

**_Final Maturity and Amortization of Principal_**
The Term Loan matures on August 31, 2024 (assuming that at least 50.0% of the aggregate principal
amount of 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes currently outstanding are refinanced with proceeds from the notes
offered hereby). The Revolver will mature on August 31, 2022 (assuming that at least 50.0% of the
aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes currently outstanding are refinanced with
proceeds from the notes offered hereby).

The Term Loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.0% of the
original principal amount of the Term Loan, with the balance payable on the final maturity date.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities documentation provides the Issuer with the ability to extend
commitments and obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, subject to customary terms and
conditions.

**_Collateral and Guarantees_**
Indebtedness under the Term Loan and Revolver is guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by
SP Holdco I, Inc. and each of the Issuer’s current and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries
(subject to certain exceptions) and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the

55


-----

Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future tangible and intangible property assets (subject to certain
exceptions).

**_Financial Covenant_**
With respect to the Revolver, we are required to comply with a maximum consolidated total net leverage
ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities documentation) financial maintenance covenant,
which covenant is tested quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis only if, as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter of the Company, revolving loans under the Revolver (excluding letters of credit to the extent undrawn
or cash collateralized) are outstanding in an aggregate amount greater than 35% of the total commitments
under the Revolver at such time. Such financial maintenance covenant is subject to an equity cure and may
be amended or waived with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under the
Revolver.

**_Restrictive Covenants and Other Matters_**
In addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, which applies for the benefit of the
lenders under the Revolver, the Term Loan and Revolver include negative covenants restricting or limiting
the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, to, among other things:

Such negative covenants are subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions. The Term Loan and
Revolver also are subject to customary, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default

actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a
secured creditor.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

In this description, (i) the terms ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our’’ and ‘‘us’’ each refer to Surgery Center Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the ‘‘Company’’), and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (ii) the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers
only to the Company and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue $430.0 million of % Senior Notes due 2027 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The Issuer will
issue the Notes under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) to be dated as of the Issue Date, between the Issuer,
the Guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (and its successors in such capacity,
the ‘‘Trustee’’). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that will not be subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ The Indenture will not be subject to the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may not
contain all the information that is important to you and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the provisions of the Indenture. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. Copies of the
proposed form of the Indenture are available as described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ You can find the
definitions of certain terms used in this description under ‘‘— Certain Definitions.’’

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will be:

� general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer;

� _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness (including_
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes) of the Issuer;

� effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement) of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

� senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

� unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each Guarantor; and

� structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred
Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) by a Guarantor will be:

� a general unsecured senior obligation of such Guarantor;

� _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness (including guarantees_
of Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement) of such Guarantor;

� effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness (including guarantees of Indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement) of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
Indebtedness; and

� senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such
Notes are subject to Applicable Procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes
is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not
be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of $430.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on, 2027. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth

59


-----

on the cover of this offering memorandum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on
and of each year, beginning on, 2019, to Holders of record on the immediately
preceding and, respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date
to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period
will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) from time to time under the Indenture,
subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Additional Notes will be treated as
part of the same class as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture for all purposes, including waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with
the same CUSIP or ISIN, as applicable, as existing Notes unless such Additional Notes can be traded
together with the existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires
otherwise, references to ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ include
any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the
Issuer maintained for such purpose. At the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be
made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of
Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes
represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders
thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s office or agency will be the office of the
Trustee maintained for such purpose.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally, irrevocably,
fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the ‘‘Note Guarantees’’) by each existing
Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer that Guarantees the Issuer’s obligations under the Credit
Agreement (the ‘‘Initial Guarantors’’), subject to release as provided below or elsewhere in this ‘‘Description
of Notes.’’ In addition, certain future Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent
described in ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Guarantees.’’

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk
Factors — Risks Related to the Ownership of the Notes — Under certain circumstances a court could
cancel the notes or the related guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws.’’

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will automatically and unconditionally be
released and terminate upon:

(1) any sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation or merger) of the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or
any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other
than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale or other disposition is
permitted by the Indenture;

60


-----

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘— Defeasance’’ and ‘‘— Satisfaction and
Discharge’’; or

(4) such Guarantor being released from all of its obligations under all of its Guarantees of (i) payment by
the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note
Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an ‘‘Other Guarantee’’) as a result of its Guarantee of other
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘— Certain Covenants —
Limitation on Guarantees,’’ the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a
result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being understood
that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such
Indebtedness of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated,
such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated).

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding
debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any)
of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including
Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the
Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation will be
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth in the next three paragraphs, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole
or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed, plus the relevant Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on and after, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount of the
Notes redeemed set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but
excluding, the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on
of each of the years indicated below:

**REDEMPTION**

-----

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional
Notes issued after the Issue Date) at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of the
Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date with an amount
not to exceed the net cash proceeds received by, or contributed to, the Issuer from any Equity Offering;
_provided that:_

(1) in each case, the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
(including any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date) remains outstanding immediately
thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries).

All notices of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘— Selection and Notice’’ below.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, such notice will describe each such condition, and if applicable, will state that,
in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic
transmission) as any or all such conditions are satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied by such redemption date, or
by the redemption date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s
discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In
addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of
the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes
as described under the captions ‘‘— Change of Control’’ and ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Sales
of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’ The Issuer may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the
open market or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the applicable registrar, as
applicable, will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis or by lot or by using a pool factor (or, in the
case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under ‘‘— Book Entry, Delivery and Form,’’ based on a
method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as required by the Applicable Procedures of DTC;
_provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a_
Note not redeemed to less than $2,000), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depository requirements. None of the Trustee, the applicable registrar nor any of their agents shall be liable

62


-----

for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph (including the procedures of the relevant
depositaries).

No Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically
(when in global form) or mailed by first-class mail (when in physical form) at least 30 but not more than
60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address,
except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is (a) issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture or (b) subject to one or more conditions precedent and such redemption
date is delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its
sole discretion), as described above.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder of Notes upon
cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption,
as such date may be delayed, unless such redemption is cancelled as described above. On and after the
redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue
on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of DTC, notices may be given by
delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, in accordance with DTC’s Applicable Procedures for communication
to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer, registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection
with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer. Also, the Issuer will
not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note during the period of 30 days before
the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, subject to the exceptions
described below, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described
below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the
right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of
Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register as provided under ‘‘— Selection and
Notice,’’ describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will
be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, subject to
extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a
Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent

63


-----

that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Credit Agreement provides, and we expect that future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer
would constitute a default thereunder and may prohibit or limit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could
seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will
remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes
would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in
certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of
incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the
initial purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of
Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect
our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness, including
Secured Indebtedness, are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation
on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on
Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants,
however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice
of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under
the caption ‘‘— Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption
price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a
condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at
the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change
of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

64


-----

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**
Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day (each such day, a ‘‘Suspension Date’’) and continuing until any Reversion Date
(as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

� ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’

� ‘‘— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’

� ‘‘— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,’’

� ‘‘— Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,’’

� ‘‘— Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,’’

� ‘‘— Limitation on Guarantees,’’ and

� the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘— Merger and Consolidation.’’

Additionally, upon the occurrence of an event resulting in Suspended Covenants, the amount of Excess
Proceeds from Net Available Cash shall be reset to zero.

If on any date following a Suspension Date the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status (any
such date, a ‘‘Reversion Date’’), then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated and be
applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation
or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes
subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which
event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an
Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall
be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended
Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions
taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the applicable Reversion Date, regardless of whether
such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in
effect during such period. The period of time between a Suspension Date and a Reversion Date is referred
to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

65


-----

On any Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the applicable Suspension Period will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the
second paragraph of ‘‘— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Calculations
made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under
‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period; provided, that no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during
the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under
‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Subsidiaries’’ as if such covenant would have been in effect during such
period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on
Restricted Payments.’’ Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on and after the Reversion Date pursuant to an
agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause
(6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in
clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Restrictions
on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be
deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ on and after any Reversion
Date. During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be
suspended. All such further obligations to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion
Date, but no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under
‘‘— Limitation on Guarantees’’ after the end of a Suspension Period with respect to any guarantee entered
into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The
Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the credit rating of the Notes or to notify Holders of the occurrence of
a Suspension Date or a Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided,
_however, that the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and issue shares of_
Disqualified Stock, and any Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue
shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock if, on the date of such Incurrence and after
giving Pro Forma Effect thereto, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of such Incurrence is no less than 2.00 to
1.00 determined on a Pro Forma Basis.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) (x) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
at the time of Incurrence not greater than (i) $1,711 million, plus (ii) additional amounts, so long as
in the case of this clause (ii) only, on the date of such Incurrence and after giving Pro Forma Effect
thereto the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries does
not exceed 3.90 to 1.00 as of the most recently ended Test Period at the time of such Incurrence
(provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may be Incurred under this clause
(1)(x)(ii), (I) all Indebtedness then being Incurred pursuant to this clause (1)(x)(ii) on such date in
reliance on this clause (1)(x)(ii) shall be deemed to be included as Consolidated Secured
Indebtedness in clause (x) of the definition of ‘‘Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio’’ and (II) any
cash proceeds of any new Indebtedness then being incurred shall not be netted from the numerator in

66


-----

the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Secured
Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (1)(x)(ii) for purposes of determining whether such Indebtedness
can be Incurred), and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness
described in clause (1)(x);

(2) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to, or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer issued to, and held by any
Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to, or Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary issued to, and held by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being held by a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock to a
Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than any pledge of such
Indebtedness or Capital Stock constituting a Permitted Lien),

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (to the extent such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is then
outstanding) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any Guarantee
thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (3)
above) outstanding on the Issue Date, (c) Indebtedness under the Existing Notes (other than any
‘‘Additional Notes’’ issued under the Existing Notes Indenture) and any Guarantee thereof, (d)
Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or
clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and
(e) Management Advances;

(5) (x) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and
Preferred Stock Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, to finance an acquisition, merger,
amalgamation or consolidation or (y) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (I) of
Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms
hereof (including designating an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) or (II) otherwise
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition, merger,
amalgamation or consolidation in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that, after giving effect
to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or designation described in this clause (5),
on a Pro Forma Basis:

(a) the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant,

(b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the most
recently ended Test Period would not be lower than the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately
prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or designation,

(c) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not
greater than 6.20 to 1.00 as of the most recently ended Test Period; provided that any cash
proceeds of any new Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock then being Incurred

67


-----

shall not be netted from the numerator in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio for
purposes of calculating the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (5)(c) for
purposes of determining whether such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock can
be Incurred,

(d) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the
most recently ended Test Period would not be higher than immediately prior to such acquisition,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation or designation; provided that any cash proceeds of any new
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock then being Incurred shall not be netted from
the numerator in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (5)(d) for purposes of determining
whether such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock can be Incurred, or

(e) in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness Incurred in contemplation of the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the only obligors with respect to such
Indebtedness shall be those Persons who were obligors of such Indebtedness prior to such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes) and
obligations in respect of Bank Products;

(7) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and Preferred
Stock Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, represented by Finance Lease Obligations
or Purchase Money Obligations (including in connection with a Permitted Sale and Leaseback), in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all
other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock Incurred pursuant to this clause and then
outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (a) $150.0 million and (b) 50.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time of
Incurrence and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
bid, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, value added or other tax or other
guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and
warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or
guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, (b) the
honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against
insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence; (c) customer_
deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice from customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice; (d) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar

Refinanced Notes Issue Date from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded Contribution)
or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, and any Refinancing

described below under ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ in an aggregate outstanding principal
amount not to exceed at any time the greater of (a) $75.0 million and (b) 25.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) at the time of
Incurrence; and

(19) to the extent constituting Indebtedness, all premiums (if any), interest (including Post-Petition
Interest), fees, expenses, charges and additional or contingent interest on obligations described in
clauses (1) through (18) above.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock at any time, whether at the time of incurrence or upon the
application of all or a portion of the proceeds thereof or subsequently, meets the criteria of more than
one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and
may from time to time subsequently reclassify, such item (or portion of such item) of Indebtedness
and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) subject to clause (3) below, additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock may later be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to any type of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in the first and second paragraphs of
this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision at
the time of reclassification;

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Credit Agreement that was Incurred on the
Existing Notes Escrow Release Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and may not be reclassified at
any time pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph;

(4) [reserved];

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (10),
(11) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock permitted by this covenant need not be
permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

70


-----

(9) the amount of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding as of any date
shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount and (b) the principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock;

(10) in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is
Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clause 1(x)(ii) or (5) of the
second paragraph of this covenant) on the same date that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is Incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or
clause 1(x)(ii) or (5) of the second paragraph of this covenant, then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will
be calculated with respect to such Incurrence under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause
1(x)(ii) or (5) of the second paragraph of this covenant without regard to any Incurrence under the
second paragraph of this covenant (other than with respect to any Incurrence under clause 1(x)(ii) or
(5) of the second paragraph of this covenant);

(11) unless the Issuer elects otherwise, the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock will be deemed Incurred first under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause 1(x)(ii) or (5)
above to the extent permitted, with the balance incurred or issued under the second paragraph of this
covenant (other than pursuant to clause 1(x)(ii) or (5) above).

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be
an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ‘‘— Limitation on
_Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’_

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock is not permitted to be Incurred as
of such date under the covenant described under this ‘‘— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock,’’ the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant)._

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was originally incurred, in the case of term indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
revolving credit indebtedness. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the
same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor,
as the case may be.

consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) or Investment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Payments described in clauses (1) through (26) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted
Investment,’’ the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) or

78


-----

Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment, or later reclassify such Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) or Investment (or portion thereof), among such clauses (1) through (26) above, the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more exceptions contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted
Investment,’’ in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value
of any Restricted Payment made in cash shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any noncash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Board
of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith (which, in the case of any non-cash Restricted Payments
exceeding a fair market value of $37.5 million, shall be evidenced by resolutions approved by the Board of
Directors of the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Liens_**
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or
permit to exist any Lien (each, an ‘‘Initial Lien’’) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness or related
guarantee of Indebtedness, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, other than Permitted
Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the
obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon
the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Lien (or a portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in one or more of the clauses
contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or later
divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Lien (or any portion thereof)
among one or more clauses contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ in a manner that otherwise
complies with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in
cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

79


-----

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including
the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Credit Agreement), or
(b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees or
(b) the Existing Notes Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Note Guarantees (as defined in the

Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into
in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided
that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the successor entity, any Subsidiary thereof
or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the successor entity;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance
of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security
agreements;

instrument taken as a whole (i) are not materially less favorable to the Holders than the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, together with the security documents associated
therewith as in effect on the Issue Date (as determined by the Issuer) or (ii) either (a) the Issuer
determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or

Notes as and when due (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (b) such encumbrance or
restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument;

determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset
Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) if the property or assets sold or otherwise disposed of have a
fair market value in excess of $7.5 million, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents;

(3) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, at its respective option, will apply an amount equal to
such Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor to the extent the
property or assets that are the subject of such Asset Disposition were owned by such NonGuarantor or Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the property or assets of such NonGuarantor so disposed (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in
connection with any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant
to this clause (a), the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid, redeemed or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase
Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided, further, that, to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary prepays, repays, redeems, or purchases Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (ii), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided
under ‘‘— Optional Redemption,’’ through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases
are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with
the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their
Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest,
if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be purchased to, but excluding, the date of
purchase; and/or

(b) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets within 365 days from the later of (i) the
date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided,
_however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available_
Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Available
Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an
‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the event that any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith,
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a ‘‘Second

82


-----

_Commitment’’) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any_
Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available
Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or_
clause (b) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If an amount equal to the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided, and within the time period (including as extended) set
forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such amount used to make an
offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (3)(a)(ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph, will be
deemed to have been applied whether or not such offer is accepted), then such amount not applied or
invested or committed to be applied or invested will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the
Indenture. Within 10 Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture
exceeds $75.0 million in any fiscal year, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Disposition
_Offer’’) to all Holders of the Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects or is required to by the terms of any_
Pari Passu Indebtedness, to holders or lenders of any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness (including
the Existing Notes), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which such Asset Disposition Offer applies that is an integral multiple of $1,000
that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, or 100% of the accreted value
thereof, if less (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided
for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable; provided that no
Note of less than $2,000 remains outstanding thereafter. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset
Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail as provided under ‘‘— Selection and Notice,’’ with a
copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will
be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to
the procedures required by the Indenture, or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures of
DTC, and described in such notice.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in
an unauthorized denomination will remain outstanding after such purchase. Upon completion of any Asset
Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any
remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion).

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Dollars.

83


-----

For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the (x) assumption or (y) cancellation, extinguishment or termination of Indebtedness or other
liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such
balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date
of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) contingent or otherwise, in each
case, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor) and, in the case of clause (x) only, the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of $75.0 million and 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended
Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) (with the fair market value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from
purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the
Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or conduct any
transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service)
with any of the Issuer’s Affiliates (other than Holdings, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or any

84


-----

entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) (an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’)
involving aggregate value in excess of $15.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that would reasonably be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of $37.5 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case, in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) or any joint venture (regardless of the form of
legal entity) in which the Issuer or any Subsidiary has invested (and which joint venture would not be
an Affiliate of the Issuer but for the Issuer’s or a Subsidiary of the Issuer’s ownership of Capital Stock
in such joint venture) to the extent otherwise permitted under this ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ section of this
‘‘Description of Notes’’ (other than solely by reference to this covenant);

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or instrument in effect as of, or on, the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders in any material respect (taken as a whole);

85


-----

(7) (i) any customary transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified
Securitization Financing and (ii) any customary transaction with a Receivables Subsidiary effected as
part of a Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, in each case, in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are
fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or the senior management of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms
no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the
Issuer or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate or similar entity;

(10) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) of
the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and the granting of
registration and other customary rights in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) [reserved];

(12) (i) direct or indirect investments by Permitted Holders in securities, Indebtedness or Disqualified
Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and payment to any Permitted Holder of all
reasonable out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or
indirect investment in securities, Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) so long as the investment is being offered by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
generally to other investors who are not Affiliates of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary on the
same or more favorable terms and at least a majority of the principal amount of such Indebtedness or
a majority of the aggregate liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock is purchased by Persons who
are not Affiliates of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) payments to Permitted Holders in
respect of securities, Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
contemplated in the foregoing clause (i) or that were acquired from Persons other than the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with the terms of such securities,
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock;

(13) the Previous Transactions and any Permitted Reorganization and the payment of all fees and expenses
related to the Previous Transactions and any Permitted Reorganization;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or
purchase agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Issue Date (or for any such
terminated agreement for which such Person may be subject to contingent indemnity or
reimbursement obligations as of the Issue Date) and any similar agreement that it may enter into
thereafter, and the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses pursuant thereto;
_provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary_
of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar
agreement entered into after the Issue Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that

86


-----

the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders
in any material respects;

(16) the payment of customary indemnities and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to the Sponsor
Reimbursement Agreement;

(17) any Intercompany License Agreements;

(18) transactions undertaken pursuant to membership in a purchasing consortium;

(19) the existence and performance of agreements and transactions with any Unrestricted Subsidiary that
were entered into prior to the designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as such Unrestricted Subsidiary
to the extent that the transaction was permitted at the time that it was entered into with such
Restricted Subsidiary and transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate
prior to the redesignation of any such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that such transaction was not entered into in contemplation of such designation or redesignation, as
applicable;

(20) payments to or from, and transactions with, any joint venture in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice or industry norms (including any cash management activities related
thereto);

(21) payments by the Issuer (and any Parent Entity) and any Subsidiaries thereof pursuant to tax sharing
agreements among the Issuer (and any Parent Entity) and such Subsidiaries on customary terms to the
extent attributable to the ownership or operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided that, in each case, the amount of such payments in any fiscal year does not exceed the_
amount that the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Unrestricted Subsidiaries (to the extent of
the amount received from Unrestricted Subsidiaries) would have been required to pay in respect of
such foreign, federal, state and/or local taxes for such fiscal year had the Issuer, the Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Unrestricted Subsidiaries (to the extent described above) paid such taxes
separately from any such Parent Entity; and

(22) payments by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of reasonable insurance premiums to, and
any borrowings or dividends received from, any Captive Insurance Subsidiary.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**
The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause an Event of Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment
made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under
the covenant described above under the caption ‘‘— Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or
more clauses of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment,’’ as determined by the Issuer. That designation will
only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary.’’ The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default or an Event of
Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
by filing with the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding
conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption ‘‘— Certain Covenants —
_Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the_
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted

87


-----

Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be
incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted
to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘— Certain Covenants —
_Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,’’ the Issuer will be in default of such_
covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
_Stock,’’ calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as of the most recently ended Test Period; and (2) no Default or_
Event of Default would be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Issuer shall
be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer
giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with
the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**
Whether or not required by the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding, if not filed electronically with
the SEC through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (or any successor
system) (‘‘EDGAR’’), from and after the Issue Date, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee and the Holders
within 15 days after the time periods specified below:

(1) all financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms
10-Q and 10-K, if the Issuer were required to file such Forms, including a ‘‘Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ (which, with respect to both annual
and quarterly reports, will include a presentation of ‘‘Credit Agreement EBITDA’’ that conforms in all
material respects to the presentation included in this offering memorandum) and, with respect to the
annual information only, a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent
registered accountants, within, in the case of annual information, 90 days after the end of each fiscal
year and within, in the case of quarterly information, 60 days after the end of each of the first three
fiscal quarters of each fiscal year; and

(2) as promptly as provided in the SEC’s rules and regulations, all current reports that would be required
to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Issuer were required to file such reports in a manner that
complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form.

To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods
specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Issuer will be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect
thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of
the Holders under ‘‘— Events of Default’’ if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total
outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations
on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have
been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the
Issuer agrees that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities
analysts and prospective purchasers, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Holders pursuant
to the second immediately preceding paragraph, unless otherwise made available on EDGAR, the Issuer
shall also post copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website
(which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Issuer or a third party) to which access will be

88


-----

given to Holders, prospective purchasers of the Notes (which prospective purchasers shall be limited to
‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons
(as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Issuer), and securities analysts and market making financial institutions that are
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer; provided, further, that such Holders, prospective investors, security
analysts or market makers will agree to (1) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein)
and information as confidential, (2) not use such reports (and the information contained therein) and
information for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (3) not
publicly disclose or distribute any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in the preceding paragraphs of this covenant
with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to a
Parent Entity (including by making such reports available through EDGAR); provided that the same is
accompanied by unaudited consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences
between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has made
available through EDGAR the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Issuer or
any Parent Entity (including any consolidated financial information required by Regulation S-X relating to
the Issuer), the Issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant.

The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of the Notes to discuss financial
information for the previous quarter; it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the
same conference call as with the lenders under any Credit Facility (if applicable) or with any equity
investors of the Issuer or any Parent Entity and analysts. In the event that the Issuer or any Parent Entity
does not hold any such conference call with equity investors and analysts, each such conference call will be
following the last day of each most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Issuer before or after (but not later
than 10 Business Days after) the time that the Issuer distributes the financial statements as set forth in the
first paragraph above. Prior to such conference call, the Issuer will issue a press release announcing the
time and date of such conference call and providing instructions to Holders, securities analysts and
applicable current and prospective investors on how to obtain access to such call.

The Trustee will have no responsibility whatsoever to determine whether any posting or filing through
EDGAR or on any website as described herein has occurred.

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**
The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries
(and non-Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiaries Guarantee
other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Guarantee Indebtedness of the Issuer
under the Credit Agreement), other than a Guarantor, to Guarantee the payment of any capital markets debt
securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit Agreement, in each
case, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a
Guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary substantially to the same
extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee; and

89


-----

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the
Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary
under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that_
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or
in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee
of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Restricted Subsidiary would not be
permitted under applicable law.

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the
30-day period described in clause (1) above.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**
_The Issuer_
The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all
its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the resulting or surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (such
resulting or surviving Person, including, if applicable, the Issuer, or such transferred Person, as
applicable, the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the
United States, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company
(if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and if such Successor
Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation organized or existing under
such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the applicable
Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable
Successor Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, on a Pro Forma Basis, either (a) the applicable
Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock’’ or (b) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio as of the most recently ended Test_
Period would not be lower than it was for such Test Period immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer (or Successor Company if other than the Issuer) shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or
transfer, and such supplemental indenture (if any), comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving
an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including
as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and (if other than the Issuer) be substituted for, and may exercise
every right and power of, the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, and in such event where the
Successor Company is not the Issuer, the Issuer will automatically be released from its obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under such Notes or the Indenture.

90


-----

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in
this sentence), any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate with or merge with or into, or
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Issuer may consolidate with or merge with or into, or wind up into an Affiliate of the Issuer
solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in the United States, any state thereof, the District of
Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

_Guarantors_
Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Note Guarantee as described
under the caption ‘‘— Guarantees’’ above, no Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions,

unless

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor concurrently with the transaction;

(B) either (x) such Guarantor is the resulting or surviving Person or (y)(I) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Person’’) will be a Person organized and existing under the
laws of the United States, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the
Successor Person (if not a Guarantor or the Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Guarantor under the
Indenture and such Guarantor’s related Note Guarantee, (II) immediately after giving effect to
the transaction, on a Pro Forma Basis, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
(III) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer, and such supplemental
indenture (if any), comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction
of the applicable sub-clauses (y)(I) and (y)(II) above; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale, lease or other disposition (including by way of consolidation,
amalgamation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any
Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its
assets to, the Issuer or another Guarantor, (b) any Guarantor may liquidate, dissolve or wind up if the Issuer
determines in good faith that such liquidation, dissolution or winding up is in the best interests of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and is not materially disadvantageous to the
Holders, and (c) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge with or into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized in the United States, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia
for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such Guarantor, reincorporating such Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such Guarantor.

91


-----

**Events of Default**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 consecutive
days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or
obligation (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture;
_provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under_
‘‘Reports,’’ such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 90 days after written notice
described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (‘‘payment
_default’’); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’);_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which
has been so accelerated, aggregates $60.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary
(or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)
(the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken
together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
$60.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged
and unstayed for a period of more than 60 consecutive days after such judgment becomes final, and
in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced
by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default
_provision’’); or_

(7) any Guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the
Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in
accordance with the Indenture.

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the

92


-----

Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within
the time specified in clauses (3) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If after the Issue Date an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above
with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and
the Trustee, may declare the principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the
Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of an Event of Default described in clause (4)
above, such Event of Default and any declaration of acceleration of the Notes occurring on account thereof
(and any related default occurring under clause (1) or (2) above as a result of the acceleration of the Notes)
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the applicable Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case,
not later than 30 days after the declaration of acceleration (if any) of the Notes with respect thereto, and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal of,
and premium or interest, if any, on, the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Notes, have been cured or waived.

If after the Issue Date an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs
and is continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes under the Indenture
may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except a continuing Default with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes
and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to
any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense that may be incurred. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy
with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense;

93


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that,
in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise
of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of such person’s own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or
not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing
of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days
after being notified in writing by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signer thereof knows of any Default that has occurred and is continuing. The Issuer is required
to deliver to the Trustee written notice of any events of which it is aware, within 30 days after the Issuer
becoming aware thereof, which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, the
Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or waiver may not
with respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the stated rate of, or extend the stated time for payment of, interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed (for the avoidance of doubt, other than provisions relating to a Change of
Control and Asset Dispositions); provided that any amendment to the minimum notice requirement
may be made with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of then
outstanding Notes;

94


-----

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any right to receive payment of
principal of and interest on such Holder’s Notes;

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(8) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes or Note Guarantees that would adversely affect
the Holders; or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the
Guarantors (with respect to any Note Document to which it is a party), as applicable, may amend or
supplement, or waive any provision of, any Note Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
‘‘Description of Notes,’’ to the extent such provision was intended to be a verbatim recitation thereof,
as such intention is set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, or reduce the minimum denomination of the
Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a Successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(6) at the Issuer’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification
of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act (it being agreed that the Indenture will not on the
Issue Date, and need not thereafter, qualify under the Trust Indenture Act);

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Notes;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock,’’ to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of_
the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee
or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is
provided for under the Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note
Document; or

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes;
_provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes_
being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect.

95


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of or supplement to any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the
Note Guarantees and the Indenture (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust.

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the covenants described under ‘‘— Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph
under ‘‘— Merger and Consolidation’’) and ‘‘— Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to
such covenants described under ‘‘— Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under
‘‘— Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer
exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant
Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under ‘‘— Events of Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer (x) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee cash in Dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes to, but excluding,
the date of redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires
the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any
such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium Deficit’’) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior
to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit will be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms
that such Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward such redemption; and (y) must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,
confirming that (a) in the case of legal defeasance, (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been
published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the issuance of the
Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), that based thereon the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such legal defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred and (b) in the case of
covenant defeasance, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax

96


-----

purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant
defeasance had not occurred;

(2) an Opinion of Counsel stating that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of
Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(4) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
and

(5) with respect to U.S. Government Obligations or a combination of money and U.S. Government
Obligations, a certificate from an Independent Financial Advisor expressing their opinion that the
payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S.
Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times
and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal, premium (if any) and interest on the notes
to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will provide that it will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Holders) have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b)(i) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (x) have become due and payable, (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer;
(ii) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Dollars or U.S.
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof (together with, if U.S. Government Obligations or a
combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations are deposited, a certificate from an Independent
Financial Advisor to the effect set forth in clause (5) under ‘‘— Defeasance’’), as applicable, in the case of
Notes, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to, but excluding, the
date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to, but excluding, the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; provided, that (I) upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture
to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of
the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited
with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption and (II) any Applicable Premium Deficit will be set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward such
redemption; (iii) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and
(iv) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating
that all conditions precedent under the ‘‘— Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to
the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (b)(i), (b)(ii) and (b)(iii)).

97


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any personal liability for any obligations of the Issuer under
the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting such person’s own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with
the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to
the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or
(c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove
the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any
court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes, fees
and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so
long as any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to
DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such
notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

Any notice provided to a Holder by publication shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such
publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is
made. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed (or per the procedures of DTC, in the case of the global notes). Failure to mail or deliver a notice
or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other

98


-----

Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed or delivered in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes
of any provision of the Indenture which will require that no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of
Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such
condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or
specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreement for such Limited
Condition Transaction is entered into.

Furthermore, in connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction,
for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which will require the calculation of any
financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio and the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing availability under baskets to be set forth in the Indenture (including baskets measured as a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA);

in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with
any Limited Condition Transaction, an ‘‘LCT Election’’), the date of determination of whether any such
action is permitted hereunder shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreement for such Limited
Condition Transaction is entered into (the ‘‘LCT Test Date’’), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the
Limited Condition Transaction, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to
take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio,
test or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the Issuer has
made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested
as of the LCT Test Date would have failed to have been satisfied as a result of fluctuations in any such
ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA, at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have
been satisfied as a result of such fluctuations and (ii) such ratios, tests or baskets shall not be tested at the
time of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, unless the Issuer elects in its sole discretion
to test such ratio, test or basket on the date such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated instead of
the date of the related definitive agreement. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for any Limited
Condition Transaction, then in connection with any event or transaction occurring after the relevant LCT Test
Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or
the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and
discharge or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is
terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction
(a ‘‘Subsequent Transaction’’) in connection with which a ratio, test or basket availability calculation must
be made on a Pro Forma Basis or giving Pro Forma Effect to such Subsequent Transaction, for purposes of
determining whether such ratio, test or basket availability has been complied with under the Indenture, any
such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited
Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith have been consummated.

In the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, Guarantees, redeems, repays,
defeases, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness (in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid
under any revolving credit facility or line of credit in the ordinary course of business for working capital
purposes) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock, in each case, (i) during the applicable Test Period for
which the Consolidated Coverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or test under the Indenture is being
calculated or (ii) subsequent to the end of such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio or such other financial ratio or test under the
Indenture is made (the ‘‘Ratio Calculation Date’’), then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio shall be calculated
giving Pro Forma Effect to such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, repayment, defeasance,
retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock, as the
case may be, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period (and for the
purposes of the numerator of each of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period).

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Specified Transaction that has been made
by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the applicable Test Period or subsequent to the
end of such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated
on a Pro Forma Basis assuming that all Specified Transactions (and the change in any associated interest
coverage obligations and change in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used
therein, as applicable, attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of such Test
Period. If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the
beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation or amalgamation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or test being calculated pursuant to the Indenture
shall be calculated giving Pro Forma Effect thereto for such Test Period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, consolidation or amalgamation had occurred at the beginning of such Test Period.

For purposes of this definition and the definitions of ‘‘Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio’’ and
‘‘Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio,’’ whenever Pro Forma Effect is to be given to a Specified
Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief
accounting officer of the Issuer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of ‘‘run-rate’’ cost
savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies resulting from or relating to
such Specified Transaction (and related insourcing initiatives) projected by the Issuer in good faith to be
realized as a result of actions taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are
expected to be taken (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as though such cost savings, operating expense
reductions, operating improvements and synergies had been realized on the first day of such period and as
if such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies were realized
during the entirety of such period and such that ‘‘run-rate’’ means the full recurring benefit for a period that
is associated with any action taken, for which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken
net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions), and any such
adjustments shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests relating

106


-----

to such Specified Transaction (and in respect of any subsequent pro forma calculations in which such
Specified Transaction or cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies
are given Pro Forma Effect) and during any applicable subsequent Test Period for any subsequent
calculation of such financial ratios and tests; provided that (A) such amounts are reasonably identifiable
and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, (B) such actions are taken or substantial
steps with respect to such actions are or are expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of
such Specified Transaction, and (C) no amounts shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts
that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof),
whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given Pro Forma Effect, the interest on
such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Ratio Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire applicable Test Period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable
to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Finance Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of

Regulation S Legend upon certification by the transferor in the form set forth in the Indenture that the
transfer of any such Restricted Note has been made in accordance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act.
Each purchaser understands that under current market practices settlement of the transfer of any such note

offering memorandum.

146


-----

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The notes sold outside the United States to non-US persons in offshore transactions pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’).

The notes sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be represented by a
global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Note’’). Following the
initial distribution of notes, such notes may be transferred to certain institutional ‘‘accredited investors’’ in
the secondary market, and such notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons (the ‘‘IAI Global Note’’ and, together with the Regulation S Global Note and the
144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). On the date of issuance, the Global Notes will be deposited with
the trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), as custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of
DTC.

Investors who are qualified institutional buyers and who purchase notes in reliance on Rule 144A may hold
their interests in a Rule 144A Global Note directly through DTC if they are DTC participants, or indirectly
through organizations that are DTC participants. Investors who are institutional ‘‘accredited investors’’ and
who purchase notes may hold their interests in an IAI Global Note directly through DTC if they are DTC
participants, or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Investors who hold beneficial
interests in a Regulation S Global Note may hold such interests directly through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V.,
as operator of the Euroclear System (‘‘Euroclear’’) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (‘‘Clearstream’’), if they are
participants in these systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Note on behalf of
their participants through their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold the interests in the
Regulation S Global Note in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC.

Through and including the period ending 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the notes (the
‘‘40 Day Period’’), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be held through Euroclear
and Clearstream (as indirect participants in DTC). The ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the
‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be issued only in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC or
persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC and its
participants.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC will credit on its book-entry
registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such a
participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the
notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of the notes in certificated form and will not be considered the
registered owners or ‘‘Holders’’ of notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominees) will be considered the holders of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC
and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

147


-----

Neither the Issuer, nor the Trustee under the Indenture, nor any of the Issuer’s or the Trustee’s respective
agents, will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive notes in registered
form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) only in the following circumstances:

� if DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary or has ceased
to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor depository
is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days;

� if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to exchange in whole, but not
in part, the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes; or

� if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing to DTC following an event of
default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or the Issuer, as applicable (in
accordance with its customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting
the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ unless that legend is not required by the Indenture
or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC will distribute the amount received
by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by DTC in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any
time, DTC will credit their respective participants’ accounts by lot; provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than $2,000, as applicable, principal amount at maturity, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium and interest) will
be made by the Issuer in dollars to the paying agent. The paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to
DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (i.e., DTC or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

� any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

� any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant.

148


-----

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in a
‘‘street name.’’

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through DTC in dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction
of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global
Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right, subject to certain restrictions, to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any
reason, including to sell the notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery of such
securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Book Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

During the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in (i) the 144A Global Note only if such transfer is
made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the
United States and other jurisdictions or (ii) the IAI Global Note only if such transfer is made to an
‘‘accredited investor’’ under the Securities Act that is an institutional ‘‘accredited investor’’ acquiring the
securities for its own account or for the account of an institutional ‘‘accredited investor’’ and the transferee
first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to such effect or otherwise
in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with
all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the 144A Global Note
without compliance with these certification requirements.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry
Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if

149


-----

any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a
written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with
the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Transfers involving an exchange of a Book-Entry Interest for another Book-Entry Interest will be done by DTC
by means of an instruction originating from the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal at
Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made
to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in
the principal amount of the corresponding Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit
transfers of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after
the date of initial issuance of the notes.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee or
any of their agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is:

� a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law;

� a ‘‘banking organization’’ under New York Banking Law;

� a member of the Federal Reserve System;

� a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

� a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC
participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and
certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock
Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct
participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as
indirect participants.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services
to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities
markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear
and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities
that do not participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the

150


-----

lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons
take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC will receive
distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement
System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore be required by
DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. You should be aware that investors will only be able to
make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving notes through DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for
business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any guarantor, the Trustee or
any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, accounts
will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book- Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC holders on the business day following
the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and will settle in same-day funds. Since the
purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State will
be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Member

circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Company or the Representative to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive in relation to such offer. Neither the Company nor the
Representative has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in
which an obligation arises for the Company or the Representative to publish a prospectus for such offer.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression ‘‘an offer of notes to the public’’ in relation to any notes in
any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe
the notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus
Directive that Relevant Member State, the expression ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC

Section 275(1A) of the SFA, and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA, or
(iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the
SFA.

Where the securities are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person which
is: (a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)), the sole
business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more
individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor; or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited
investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary is an accredited investor; then
securities (as defined in Section 239(1) of the SFA) of that corporation or the beneficiaries’ rights and
interest in that trust will not be transferable for 6 months after that corporation or that trust has acquired
the securities under Section 275 of the SFA except: (i) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the
SFA, or to a relevant person under Section 275(2) of the SFA, or any person arising from an offer referred
to in Section 275(1A) or Section 276(4)(i)(B) of the SFA; (ii) where no consideration is given for the
transfer; (iii) by operation of law; or (iv) as specified in Section 276(7) of the SFA.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in Canada_**
The notes may be sold only to purchasers in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as
principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or
subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National
Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale
of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser
within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The
purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province
or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a
non-Canadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts
(NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of
NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**_Israel_**
Sales of the notes in Israel will be made through the initial purchasers and/or through an Israeli broker(s)
engaged by them. The notes will not be offered to an Israeli person unless such offeree is a ‘‘qualified
investor’’ (as defined in the First Appendix to the Israeli Securities Law) who is not an individual (a
‘‘Qualified Israeli Investor’’) and who has (x) completed and signed a questionnaire regarding qualification
as a Qualified Israel Investor and (y) certified that it has an exemption from Israeli withholding taxes on
interest.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the
business day following the date of confirmation of orders with respect to the notes (this settlement cycle
being referred to as ‘‘T+ ’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes before the notes are delivered will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the
notes before their delivery should consult their own advisor.

155

**General**

We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to,
any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us or any guarantor of the notes and having a maturity of more
than one year from the date of issue, or publicly disclose our intention to make any offer, sale, pledge,
disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representative for a period of 90 days after the
date hereof.

We and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, that could arise from the use of this offering memorandum or to contribute to
payments which they may be required to make in that respect.

The notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market
in the notes as permitted by applicable law. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a
market in the notes and any market making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the notes. If an
active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be
adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and
financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in connection with the offering.

� Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the
initial purchasers.

� Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids
do not exceed a specified maximum.

� Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover short positions.

� Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when
the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction
to cover short positions.

These over-allotments, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price
of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These
transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial
purchasers and their affiliates have from time to time performed, various financial advisory, commercial
banking, investment banking and other related services for us and our affiliates for which they have received
customary compensation, and they may continue to do so in the future. Affiliates of certain of the initial
purchasers may be holders of the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of
the proceeds from this offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may receive customary fees and expenses in connection with
their commitments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2019 Incremental Revolver
Commitments. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.

156


-----

Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.

Further, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities or related
derivative securities and financial instruments which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers and such investment and securities activities may
involve our securities and/or instruments. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or instruments and may at any time hold for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, or recommend to clients that they acquire long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

The decision to distribute the notes was made independently of the other entities with which the initial
purchasers are affiliated, which entities had no involvement in determining whether and when to distribute
notes under the offering or the terms of this offering. Furthermore, with respect to any initial purchaser who
is affiliated with any person or entity engaged to act as an investment adviser on behalf of an advisory client
or account who has or will have indirect or direct interest in the notes, the notes being sold to such initial
purchaser shall not include any notes attributable to such client (with any such notes being allocated and
sold to the other initial purchaser) and, accordingly, the fees or other amounts received by such initial
purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall not include any fees or other
amounts attributable to such client (and, if there is any unsold allotment in the offering on the closing date
of this offering, such unsold allotment in respect of notes attributable to such client shall be allocated
solely to initial purchasers not affiliated with such client).

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**IN GENERAL**

The following is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to you of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes. It:

� is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’),
administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury
Department regulations, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) or to
different interpretations;

� does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you do not hold the notes as capital assets within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (that is, for investment purposes);

� does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you do not purchase the notes in the initial offering
for the original ‘‘issue price’’ within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (the first price at
which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for cash to the public, not including bond houses,
brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents,
or wholesalers);

� does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
circumstances or that may be relevant to you because you are subject to special rules, such as rules
applicable to banks, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment
trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, tax-exempt entities,
S corporations, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar,
insurance companies, broker-dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that have elected
the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons
holding the notes as part of a hedge, straddle, ‘‘constructive sale,’’ ‘‘conversion’’ or other integrated
transaction, or former U.S. citizens or long-term residents subject to taxation as expatriates;

� does not discuss the tax considerations to you if you use the accrual method of accounting that
requires you to include any item of gross income with respect to the notes no later than the time
such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements;

� does not discuss the effect of any state, local or foreign laws, any U.S. federal gift tax or estate tax
considerations, or the 3.8% Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income; and

� does not discuss tax considerations to an owner of notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes
a partnership or other pass-through entity.

We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) with respect to the statements
made herein, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements.

As used in this section, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ of a note means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, a citizen or individual of the United States, a corporation (or other entity
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, an estate the income of which is subject to
U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (1) the trust is subject to the primary
supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. As used in this section, a ‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ means
a beneficial owner of a note that is not a U.S. holder and is not for U.S. federal income tax purposes a
partnership or other pass-through entity.

If a partnership, or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the

158


-----

partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership that holds the notes, you
should consult your own tax advisors.

Under the terms of the notes, in certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of
principal, or to redeem the notes in advance of their stated maturity. See ‘‘Description of Notes — Change
of Control’’, ‘‘Description of Notes — Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes — Optional
Redemption’’. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, that the payment
of additional amounts and/or such redemptions are ‘‘remote’’ or ‘‘incidental’’ contingencies that should not
cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and that any additional amounts
received pursuant to such redemptions should be taxable as capital gain at the time they are received or
accrued, in accordance with your regular accounting method. Our determination will be binding on you
unless you disclose your contrary position in the manner required by the applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge
this position, the timing, character, and amount of income inclusions by you may be affected. You are urged
to consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of these rules to the notes and the
consequences thereof. This remainder of this discussion assumes that our position is correct.

**This discussion is intended for general information purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax**
**planning and advice. Please consult your own tax advisor regarding the application of U.S. federal income**
**tax laws to your particular situation and the consequences of other U.S. federal tax laws (including estate**
**and gift tax laws), state, local and foreign laws and tax treaties.**

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR U.S. HOLDERS**

This section applies to you if you are a U.S. holder.

**_Stated Interest_**
In general, stated interest paid on a note will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or
is received, in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If
you are a cash-method taxpayer, which is the case for most individuals, you must report interest on the
notes in your income when you receive it. If you are an accrual-method taxpayer, you must report interest on
the notes in your income as it accrues.

**_Original Issue Discount_**
The notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The notes will be considered to be issued with OID if the stated redemption price at maturity of
the notes exceeds its ‘‘issue price’’ (as defined above) by at least a statutorily-defined de minimis amount.
The OID de minimis amount equals [1]⁄4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity
multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity. The ‘‘stated redemption price
at maturity’’ of the notes is the total of all payments provided by the notes that are not payments of stated
interest.

The amount of OID on a note will generally be equal to the excess of the principal amount of such note over
its ‘‘issue price’’. A U.S. holder will generally be required to include such OID in gross income as ordinary
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the OID accrues, on a constant yield to maturity basis, in
advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable regardless of the U.S.
holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally must include in
income in each taxable year the sum of the daily portions of OID for each day on which it held such note
during the taxable year. To determine the daily portions of OID, the amount of OID allocable to an accrual
period is determined, and a ratable portion of such OID is allocated to each day in the accrual period. The
amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will equal the product of such note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at
the beginning of the accrual period and such note’s ‘‘yield to maturity’’ (adjusted to reflect the length of the
accrual period), less the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. A note’s ‘‘adjusted
issue price’’ at the beginning of any accrual period generally will be its issue price, increased by the amount

159


-----

of OID, if any, allocable to all prior accrual periods. A note’s yield to maturity is the discount rate that,
when used in computing the present value (as of the issue date) of all payments to be made on the note,
produces an amount equal to the note’s issue price. An accrual period may be of any length, and the length
of the accrual periods may vary over the life of the note, provided that no accrual period may be longer than
one year. Each scheduled payment of stated interest or principal on the Note must occur on either the first
day or last day of an accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the
amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the
beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual
period. Under these rules, a U.S. holder will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID
in successive accrual periods.

A U.S. holder may elect to treat all interest on a note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross
income under the constant yield method described above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in
which a U.S. holder acquired the note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders
should consult with their own tax advisors about this election.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**
On the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note (including a repurchase at the
option of a holder as described in ‘‘Description of Notes — Change of Control’’):

� You will have taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount received by you (which
does not include amounts representing accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable to you as
ordinary income as described above) and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your tax basis in a note
is generally the cost of the note to you decreased by any payments on the note received by you other
than payments of stated interest, but increased by the amount of OID (if any) previously accrued on
the note.

� Your gain or loss will generally be a capital gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or loss if
you have a holding period for the note that is more than one year on the date of disposition.
Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are
generally eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income tax. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitation.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**
Information reporting requirements generally will apply with respect to payments of principal, payments of
interest, accruals of OID, and the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of a note paid to you, unless you
are an exempt recipient. Backup withholding (imposed at the then-applicable rate) may apply to those
payments or payments of OID if (i) you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number (‘‘TIN’’) or
certification of exempt status in the required manner; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that you have furnished
to the payor an incorrect TIN; (iii) in the case of interest payments, you are notified by the IRS that it has
failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or payments of OID; or (iv) in the case of interest
payments, you fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct TIN and that the
IRS has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

U.S. holders should consult their personal tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from
backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a
refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS**

This section applies to you if you are a non-U.S. holder and the interest (including OID) with respect to a
note and gain you realize on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note are not effectively connected
with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business. If the interest (including OID) and gain you receive is

160


-----

effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment), you will be subject to rules similar to
those described above for U.S. holders and, therefore, such effectively connected income generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular graduated rates applicable to U.S. holders. In addition to
this treatment, if you are a corporation, you could be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or
such lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) of your ‘‘effectively connected earnings and
profits’’ for the relevant taxable year. You will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest (including
OID), as discussed below, although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or
other applicable form) in order to obtain an exemption from withholding. These rules are complex, and you
should consult your tax advisor.

**_Interest_**
Subject to the discussion below concerning FATCA and backup withholding, payments of interest (including
OID) on the notes by us or any paying agent to you will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax (collected
by means of withholding), provided that, pursuant to the ‘‘portfolio interest’’ exception:

� you do not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes
of our stock entitled to vote (within the meaning of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations),

� you are not a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of the Code) that is related, directly
or indirectly, actually or constructively, to us,

� you are not a bank receiving interest (including OID) on the notes on an extension of credit made
pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of your trade or business, and

� you satisfy certain certification requirements (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form)).

Payments of interest on the notes (including OID) that do not meet the above-described requirements will
be subject to a U.S. federal income tax of 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable income tax
treaty if you validly and timely establish that you qualify to receive the benefits of such treaty) collected by
means of withholding. To claim a reduction or exemption under a tax treaty, a non-U.S. holder generally
must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
other appropriate documentation) and claim the reduction or exemption on the form.

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. A non-U.S. holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlements to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**
Subject to the discussions below concerning FATCA and backup withholding, a non-U.S. holder will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other
disposition of the notes (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the note
(including OID), which is subject to the rules described above) unless you are an individual present in the
United States for at least 183 days during the year in which you dispose of the note, and other conditions
are satisfied. Gain recognized by non-resident individuals present in the United States for such time will be
subject to a U.S. federal income tax rate of 30%, (or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty)
which may be offset by U.S. capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, provided the non-U.S. holder timely
files U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**
Amounts of interest (including OID) paid to a non-U.S. holder on a note, and amounts withheld from such
amounts, if any, generally will be required to be reported to the IRS and to such non-U.S. holder. The IRS
may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax
authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder is resident.

161


-----

Backup withholding generally will not apply to payments of interest (including OID) on the notes if a holder
certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder as described above or otherwise establishes an exemption. Rules
relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of
proceeds from the disposition (including a sale, redemption or retirement) of a note include the following:

� The payment of the proceeds of the disposition of notes (including a sale, retirement or redemption)
to or through the U.S. office of a U.S. or foreign broker will be subject to backup withholding (at the
then-applicable rate) and related information reporting unless the non-U.S. holder provides the
certification described above or otherwise establishes an exemption.

� The payment of the proceeds of a disposition (including a sale, retirement or redemption) effected
outside the U.S. by a non-U.S. holder of the notes to or through a foreign office of a broker generally
will not be subject to backup withholding or related information reporting. However, if that broker is a
U.S. broker or has certain specified U.S. connections, then information reporting will apply.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a non-U.S. holder
under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability and may entitle such holder to a refund; provided that the required information is timely furnished
to the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of information
reporting and backup withholding in their particular situations, the availability of an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**FATCA**

Subject to certain exceptions, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as modified by U.S. Treasury
regulations, guidance from the IRS and intergovernmental agreements and subject to further guidance
(collectively, ‘‘FATCA’’), impose a withholding tax of 30% on interest income (including OID) paid on a debt
obligation of a United States company paid to (i) a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ (as the beneficial owner or
as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the
United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information
regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt
holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States
owners), and (ii) a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the
beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the
substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United States person who
directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. Withholding under FATCA generally will apply to
payments of interest (including OID) on a note regardless of when they are made. While withholding under
FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the notes
on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on
payments of gross proceeds entirely. Although these recent U.S. Treasury Regulations are not final, they can
be relied upon until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued. An intergovernmental agreement between
the United States and the applicable foreign country, or future U.S. Treasury regulations or other guidance,
may modify these requirements and result in the affected non-U.S. holders being subject to different rules.
Each holder is strongly encouraged to consult with its tax advisor regarding the implications of the potential
application of FATCA on the investment in a note.

**Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA and whether it**
**may be relevant to such holder’s acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes.**

162


-----

**CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase, holding and disposition
of the notes by (i) any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) any plan (as
defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including an
individual retirement arrangement under Section 408 of the Code), (iii) any entity the underlying assets of
which are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of any plans described above in the foregoing subsections
(i) or (ii) (as determined pursuant to U.S. Department of Labor regulations, as modified by Section 3(42) of
ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulation’’)) (collectively, the plans and entities described in subsections
(i) through (iii) above are referred to herein as ‘‘ERISA Plans’’), or (iv) any other plan, including a foreign
plan maintained outside the United States, governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) or
church plan (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) that is not subject to Title I of ERISA, but may be
subject to any federal, state, local or foreign law or regulation that is similar to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (a ‘‘Similar Law’’) (collectively, the plans, accounts or arrangements described in
subsections (i) through (iv) above are referred to herein as ‘‘Plans’’).

This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code (and the related regulations and
administrative guidance and judicial interpretations) as of the date hereof. This summary does not purport
to be complete, and no assurance can be given that future legislation, court decisions, administrative
regulations, rulings or administrative pronouncements will not significantly modify the requirements
summarized herein. Any such changes may be retroactive and may thereby apply to transactions entered
into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Accordingly, each prospective investor should consult
with its own counsel in order to understand the potential applicability of Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of
the Code and/or any other Similar Law to an investment in the notes that affect or may affect the investor
with respect to this investment.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan subject to Title I of ERISA,
and ERISA and the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its
fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation (whether direct or indirect) to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary with
respect to such ERISA Plan.

Section 404(a)(1) of ERISA sets forth a general standard of behavior and restrictions for fiduciaries of
ERISA Plans subject to Title I of ERISA. It requires that a fiduciary discharge its duties with respect to such
an ERISA Plan (i) solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such ERISA Plan, (ii) for the
exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable
expenses of administering the ERISA Plan, (iii) in accordance with a ‘‘prudent-man rule’’ (that is ‘‘with the
care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a
like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character
and with like aims’’), (iv) by diversifying the investments of the ERISA Plan so as to minimize the risk of
large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and (v) in accordance with
the documents governing the ERISA Plan insofar as they are consistent with ERISA.

In considering an investment in the notes with the assets of any such ERISA Plan, a fiduciary should give
appropriate consideration to, among other things, whether the acquisition and holding of the notes is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA or the Code including, without limitation, any prudence, diversification, delegation of control and

prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA
Plan’s portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the
ERISA Plan’s purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolio’s composition with regard
to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow
needs of the ERISA Plan, and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan’s funding
objectives. Similar duties and restrictions may apply to fiduciaries of Plans that are not subject to ERISA,
such as governmental plans, church plans and non-U.S. plans. Fiduciaries of Plans subject to Similar Laws
should consider their fiduciary duties under such Similar Laws in determining whether to invest in the notes
offered hereby.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and certain persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest,’’ within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless
a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction.

The acquisition or holding of notes by or on behalf of an ERISA Plan could give rise to a prohibited
transaction under ERISA or the Code if the Company or any of its affiliates is, or becomes, a party in
interest or a disqualified person with respect to such ERISA Plan. A party in interest or disqualified person
who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction (including, without limitation, the lending of money or
the extension of credit by the ERISA Plan) may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. For example, an ERISA Plan holding a note would be viewed by the Department
of Labor as a continuing extension of credit by the ERISA Plan to the Company. Accordingly, each original
or subsequent purchaser or transferee of a note that is or may become an ERISA Plan is responsible for
determining the extent, if any, to which the purchase and holding of a note will constitute a prohibited
transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that
engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and/or the Code, including an obligation to correct the transaction.

The Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may provide
exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase or holding of
a note. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined
by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95- 60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house
asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a
statutory exemption for certain transactions involving non-fiduciary service providers or their affiliates.
However, we cannot assure you that all of the conditions of any of these exemptions or of any other
exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Governmental plans, church plans and foreign plans are not generally subject to the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code; however, such Plans may nevertheless be subject to
Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of such a Plan should make its
own determination as to the requirements, if any, under any Similar Law applicable to the acquisition and
holding of the notes.

**Representation**

To address the above concerns, each purchaser or transferee of the notes will be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented to and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

At the time of your acquisition and throughout the period that you hold the notes or any interest therein,
either (a) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of (and for so long as you hold this note or any interest

therein will not be and will not be acting on behalf of) (i) any employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’)) that is
subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) any ‘‘plan’’ (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (‘‘Code’’)) that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including an individual
retirement arrangement under Section 408 of the Code), (iii) any entity of which the underlying assets are
considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of any plans described in the foregoing subsections (i) or (ii) (as
determined pursuant to U.S. Department of Labor regulations, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA), or
(iv) any other plan, including a foreign plan, governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) or
church plan (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) that is not subject to Title I of ERISA, but that may be
subject to any federal, state, local, foreign or other laws or regulations that are similar to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (a ‘‘Similar Law’’), or (b) the acquisition, holding and disposition of this note or
any interest therein will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a non-exempt violation of any provision of a Similar Law.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction, it is particularly important that Plan fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the
notes (and holding the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan consult with their counsel
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such
investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.

Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation that an investment in the notes would meet any or all
of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, or is appropriate for, a Plan. Purchasers of
the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes
complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction
rules of ERISA, the Code or any applicable Similar Laws.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters with regard to the validity of the notes and other legal matters will be passed upon for
us by Ropes & Gray LLP, San Francisco, California and for the initial purchasers by Latham & Watkins LLP,
Washington, D.C. Ropes & Gray LLP and some of its attorneys are limited partners of RGIP, LP, which is an
investor in certain investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital and often a co-investor with such funds.
