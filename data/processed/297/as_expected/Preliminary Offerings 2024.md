The information in the attached offering memorandum is not complete and may be changed. The materials
relating to the offering of the Notes do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or

offering of the Notes be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the

such jurisdiction.

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the
U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

**Professional investors and eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the debt securities described in the offering
memorandum is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (“U.K. MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the debt securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**

securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is

adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED MARCH 25, 2024**

**CONFIDENTIAL** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


**€** **% Senior Secured Notes due 2032**
**issued by**

# VMED O2 UK Financing I plc in accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (as defined herein)

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (the “Issuer”) is offering € million aggregate principal amount of its % Senior
Secured Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at the rate of % per annum. The Notes will mature on
April 15, 2032. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on
October 15, 2024.


In accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (as defined herein), the Joint Venture (as defined herein) intends to
use an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Finco Loan € to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible
Green Projects (as defined herein) and to pay fees and expenses in relation thereto. Accordingly, on August 5, 2022, Sustainalytics, a
provider of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) research and analysis, evaluated the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
and certified that it aligns with the 2021 Green Bond Principles (as defined herein) and provided views on the robustness and
credibility of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (which views are intended to inform investors in general, and not for a specific
investor). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all
_investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—Investors may have_
_limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance_
_new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

On the Issue Date (as defined herein), the proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to fund a eurodenominated loan in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Finco Loan €”) borrowed under
an additional facility (the “Finco Facility €”) by VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 Limited (the “Credit Facility Borrower”) under the
Credit Facility (as defined herein).

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Loan € will be guaranteed on a senior basis by
the Credit Facility Guarantors (as defined herein) and will be secured by the Credit Facility Collateral (as defined herein).


The Issuer is a special purpose financing company incorporated for the purpose of issuing the Notes and incurring certain other
indebtedness and will depend upon payments under the Finco Loan € and the applicable Related Agreements (as defined herein) to
make payments under the Notes. The Issuer will apply all payments it receives under the Finco Loan € and the applicable Related
Agreements, including in respect of principal, premiums, interest and additional amounts, if any, to make corresponding payments
under the Notes.

The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement (as defined herein) will provide for the payment of certain premiums in connection
with certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the Finco Loan € that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums payable in
respect of corresponding redemptions of the Notes, as described in “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase”. Some
or all of the Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to April 15, 2027, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of redemption and a “make-whole” premium, as described
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Some or all of the Notes may be redeemed, at any time on or after April 15, 2027, at the
redemption prices set forth elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, at any time prior to April 15, 2027, the Issuer may
redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity
offerings at the redemption prices set forth elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Prior to April 15, 2027, during each 12-month
period commencing on the Issue Date, up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of
redemption.

Following a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Facility), the Credit Facility Borrower will be required, at the election
of the Instructing Group under (and as defined in) the Credit Facility, to prepay the Finco Loan € at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of the Finco Loan €. Following any such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase— Redemption upon a Change of Control”. In the event of certain asset sales,
the Credit Facility Borrower may elect, at its option, to (i) offer to prepay a principal amount of the Finco Loan € in an aggregate
amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be made by the Issuer (not to exceed such


-----

Finco Loan €’s pro rata share of the amount of the available proceeds from the related asset sale) or (ii) subject to the payment of
certain premiums, prepay the Finco Loan € on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to the available proceeds from the related asset
sale, and, in each case, the Issuer will redeem a corresponding amount of the Notes as set forth in “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption and Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”. Further, upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law, the Issuer may redeem_
all but not less than all, of the Notes, at a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but
excluding) the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Redemption for Changes in
_Withholding Taxes”._

The Notes will be the senior and limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. On and from the Issue Date, the Notes will be
secured by all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in (i) the Finco Loan € (including all rights of the Issuer as a Credit Facility
Lender under the Credit Facility and the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement), (ii) the Deeds of Covenant, (iii) the Fee Letters,
(iv) the Expenses Agreement (excluding any transaction fees payable to the Issuer pursuant thereto and the Issuer’s rights to be
indemnified in respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts payable to parties that do not benefit from the security interests
in the Collateral), (v) the Issue Date Amounts Loans and (vi) sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the Issuer
(excluding any transaction fees payable pursuant to the Expenses Agreement) (in each case of the foregoing, as defined in
“Description of the Notes”) (collectively, the “Collateral”).

In addition, other than in certain limited circumstances specified herein, holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to the
Issuer other than in respect of amounts received by the Issuer under the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements. In each case
where amounts of principal, interest and other amounts (if any) are payable in respect of the Notes, such payments shall be made only
from and to the extent of principal, interest and other amounts (if any) actually received by or for the account of the Issuer pursuant to
the Finco Loan € and the Related Agreements between the Issuer, the Credit Facility Borrower, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 and/or
VMIH (as defined herein), as the case may be. None of VMED O2 UK Holdings (as defined herein) or any of its subsidiaries will
guarantee or provide any credit support to the Issuer with respect to its obligations under the Notes. Other than under the limited
circumstances described herein, holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of VMED O2 UK
Holdings or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), and none of VMED O2 UK Holdings or any of its subsidiaries (other than
the Issuer) will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the
Issuer for those payments, other than the obligations of the Credit Facility Borrower and/or the applicable Credit Facility Guarantors
to make payments to the Issuer pursuant to the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement and the Related Agreements. For a description
of the terms of the Notes, see “Description of the Notes”.

The Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more global notes, which will be delivered through,
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”)
(collectively, the “Clearing Systems” and each a “Clearing System”) on or about, 2024 (the “Issue Date”).

The Issuer, Virgin Media Inc. (“Virgin Media”), VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates make no assurances as to (i) whether the Notes offered hereby will meet investor criteria and
expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance for any investors, (ii) whether the

Eligible Green Projects, including their environmental and sustainability criteria or (iv) the suitability of the
Second-Party Opinion (as defined herein) or the Notes to fulfill such environmental and sustainability criteria.
The Initial Purchasers have not undertaken, nor are responsible for, any assessment of the VMED O2 Green
Bond Framework or the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, any verification of whether the VMED O2 Eligible
Green Projects meet the eligibility criteria of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework or any monitoring of the
use of proceeds. The Second-Party Opinion is not incorporated into and does not form part of this offering
memorandum. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not be a
_suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to_
_the Notes and the Structure—Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the_

_Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers are offering to sell the Notes only in places where offers and sales are
permitted. The Issuer is offering the Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering.
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the
SEC or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering
memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

This offering memorandum is a confidential document that is being provided for informational use solely in
connection with consideration of a purchase of the Notes (i) to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be
QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers and (ii) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions complying
with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S. The use of this offering memorandum for any other purpose is not
authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part nor may it be
distributed or any of its contents be disclosed to anyone other than QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers
described in (i) above or to persons considering a purchase of the Notes in offshore transactions described in
(ii) above.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Plan of Distribution” and
“Transfer Restrictions”. By purchasing any Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described in those sections of this offering memorandum. You may be
required to bear the financial risks of investing in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time, and we and the Initial Purchasers
reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to you less
than the full amount of Notes subscribed for by you. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their related entities

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes may be restricted by law
in some jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes come must
inform themselves about, and observe any restrictions on the transfer and exchange of the Notes. See “Plan of
_Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”._

which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess this offering memorandum. You must also obtain any consents
or approvals that you need in order to purchase any Notes. The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers or any of their

**STABILIZATION**

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS LIMITED (THE
“STABILIZING **MANAGER”)** (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING
MANAGER), MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO
SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH
MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING
MANAGER (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) WILL
UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER
THE DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF THE OFFER OF
THE NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO
LATER THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE AND 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE
OF THE ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES.

If issued, the Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. The Notes will be represented on
issue by one or more global notes, which will be delivered through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the
global notes will be exchangeable for definitive notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry
_Settlement and Clearance.”_

The Issuer expects that the Notes offered and sold in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified
Purchasers in reliance upon Rule 144A will be represented by beneficial interests in one or more permanent
global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons. The Issuer expects that the Notes offered and sold
outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S will be initially represented by beneficial
interests in one or more permanent global notes in registered global form.

**NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS**

Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this offering memorandum under “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes
have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the
United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and resale. Prospective purchasers are hereby
notified that the seller of any new Note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer
of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By
accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or
indirectly, any new Note to the public, where such sale is prohibited.

**NOTICE TO EU INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis of an exemption provided by Preamble 14 (and
Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “EU Prospectus Regulation”), stating that the
mere admission of securities to trading on the multilateral trading facility (as defined in point (22) of article 4(1)
of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”)), is not to be regarded in itself as an offer of securities to the
public and is therefore not subject to the obligation to draw up, approve and distribute the prospectus as required
by the EU Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do any of them

v


-----

authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The notes are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs regulation.

Each person located in a member state of the EEA to whom any offer of the Notes is made, or who receives
any communication in respect of an offer of the Notes, or who initially acquires any Notes, or to whom the Notes
are otherwise made available will be deemed to have represented, warranted, acknowledged and agreed to and
with each Initial Purchaser and the Issuer that it is not a retail investor.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_Austria. This offering memorandum has not been and will not be approved and/or published pursuant to the_**
Austrian Capital Markets Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz) as amended. Neither this offering memorandum nor any other
document connected therewith constitutes a prospectus according to the Austrian Capital Markets Act and neither
this offering memorandum nor any other document connected therewith may be distributed, passed on or
disclosed to any other person in Austria. No steps may be taken that would constitute a public offering of the
Notes in Austria and the offering of the Notes may not be advertised in Austria. Any offer of the Notes in Austria
will only be made in compliance with the provisions of the Austrian Capital Markets Act and all other laws and
regulations in Austria applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes in Austria.

**_Germany. The Notes may be offered and sold in Germany only in compliance with the German Securities_**

clearance to the AMF. Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in
France, and offers and sales of the Notes will only be made in France to providers of investment services relating
to portfolio management for the account of third parties (personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de

memorandum nor any other offering material may be distributed to the public in France.

**_Italy. The offering of the Notes has not been cleared by Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa,_**
the Italian Securities Exchange Commission (“CONSOB”) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and,
accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, nor may copies of this offering
memorandum or any other offering memorandum, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering

Republic of Italy in accordance with the Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended
(the “Financial Services Act”), CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of 15 February 2018, as amended
(“Regulation No. 20307”) and Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended (the

(b) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirement imposed by CONSOB,
the Bank of Italy (including the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of

and/or any other Italian authority.

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes by
such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**_Ireland. No action may be taken with respect to the Notes in Ireland otherwise than in conformity with the_**
provisions of (i) the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 (as amended, the
“MiFID Regulations”), including, without limitation, Regulation 5 (Requirement for Authorization) thereof or
any codes of conduct made under the MiFID Regulations and the provisions of the Investor Compensation Act
1998 (as amended), (ii) the Companies Act 2014 (as amended, the “Companies Act”), the Central Bank Acts
1942 to 2015 (as amended) and any codes of conduct rules made under Section 117(1) of the Central Bank Act
1989, (iii) the European Union (Prospectus) Regulations 2019 (as amended) (the “Irish Prospectus
**Regulations”) and any rules issued under Section 1363 of the Companies Act by the Central Bank of Ireland and**
(iv) the Market Abuse Regulations (EU 596/2014) (as amended) and any rules or guidance issued by the Central
Bank of Ireland under Section 1370 of the Companies Act. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that, to the extent any offer is made in Ireland, any offer of the Notes will be made pursuant to one or more
of the exemptions in Regulation 9(1) of the Irish Prospectus Regulations from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in Ireland of
the Notes which are subject of the offering contemplated in this offering memorandum may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Regulation 12 of the Irish Prospectus Regulations or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Regulation
51 of the Irish Prospectus Regulations, in each case, in relation to such offer. None of the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers have authorized, or authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes in circumstances in which an
obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.

**_Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. This offering memorandum has not been approved by and will not be_**
submitted for approval to the Luxembourg Supervision Commission of the Financial Sector (Commission de
_Surveillance du Secteur Financier) for purposes of a public offering or sale in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg_
(“Luxembourg”). Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in Luxembourg, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular, prospectus, form of application,
advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made available in or from, or published in,
Luxembourg except in circumstances which do not constitute a public offer of securities to the public, subject to
prospectus requirements, in accordance with the Luxembourg Act of July 10, 2005 on prospectuses for securities,
as amended (the “Prospectus Act”) and implementing the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, this offering
memorandum and any other offering memorandum, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other
material may only be distributed to (i) Luxembourg qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Act and
(ii) no more than 149 prospective investors, which are not qualified investors.

**_The Netherlands. The Notes (including rights representing an interest in each global note that represents the_**
Notes) may not be offered or sold to individuals or legal entities in The Netherlands other than to qualified
investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers) as defined in The Netherlands Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het
_financieel toezicht)._

**_Spain. The Notes will not be offered, sold or distributed, nor will any subsequent resale of Notes be carried_**
out in Spain, except in circumstances that do not require the registration of a prospectus in Spain or without
complying with all legal and regulatory requirements under Spanish securities laws. Neither the Notes nor the
offering memorandum have been or will be registered with Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valoreshe (the
“CNMV”) and therefore the offering memorandum is not intended for any public offer of the Notes in Spain that

vii


-----

would require the registration of a prospectus with the CNMV. No publicity or marketing of any kind shall be
made in Spain in relation to the Notes.

**_Switzerland. The Notes offered hereby are being offered in Switzerland on the basis of a private placement_**
only. This offering memorandum does not constitute a prospectus within the meaning of Art. 652A of the Swiss
Federal Code of Obligations. No key information document according to the Swiss Financial Services Act
(“FinSA”) or any equivalent document under the FinSA has been prepared in relation to the Notes, and,
therefore, the Notes may not be offered or recommended to private clients within the meaning of the FinSA in
Switzerland.

**NOTICE TO U.K. INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis of an exemption provided by Preamble 14 (and
Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA (the “U.K.
**Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering**
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the U.K. of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do any of them
authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum is being distributed only to and is directed only at (i) persons who are outside
the U.K., (ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments and fall within Article
19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, (as amended, the
“Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies,
unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iv) those persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with
the issue of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated, or (v) those
persons to whom it may otherwise lawfully be distributed (all such persons referred to in (i) through (v) together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must
not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to
which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons.

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the
U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. MIFID PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY**
**TARGET MARKET: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market**
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA

Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO CANADIAN INVESTORS**

principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom (“U.K. GAAP”), as in effect from time to time, including
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The
historical results of the Issuer are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future
period.

The Issuer’s financial results are reported in pound sterling. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience
translations into pound sterling have been calculated at the December 31, 2023 market rate.

**VMED O2 UK Holdings’ Financial Information**

This offering memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein includes the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Unless otherwise indicated, the historical consolidated financial information presented
herein of VMED O2 UK Holdings has been prepared in compliance with IFRS. The historical consolidated

**Other Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum we present “Annualized EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Free
Cash Flow”, “As adjusted total covenant senior net debt”, “As adjusted total covenant net debt”, “Ratio of as
adjusted total covenant senior net debt to Annualized EBITDA” and “Ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt
to Annualized EBITDA” of VMED O2 UK Holdings, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with
IFRS. VMED O2 UK Holdings believes such measures are useful to investors as they provide one basis for
comparing VMED O2 UK Holdings’ performance with the performance of other companies in the same or
similar industries, although such measures as defined by VMED O2 UK Holdings may not be directly
comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies. Such measures should be viewed as
measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating profit, net cash
inflow from operating activities and other IFRS measures of income or cash flows. See “Summary Financial and
_Operating Data of VMED O2 UK Holdings”._

**Non-Financial Key Operating Performance Data**

Each VMED O2 UK Holdings customer receiving at least one of our broadband, video or telephony
services, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe, are counted as a Fixed-Line Customer
Relationship. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly,
if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g. a primary home and a second home), that individual
generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. Mobile-only customers are excluded from
Fixed-Line Customer Relationships.

Each connection to any of VMED O2 UK Holdings’ telecommunications services is referred to as either;
(i) retail connection, (ii) internet of things (“IoT”) connection or (iii) wholesale connection.

Retail connections are counted based on the number of SIM cards in service. IoT connections are the total
number of machine-to-machine contract mobile connections, including Smart Metering (“SMIP”) contract
connections. Wholesale connections are the total number of wholesale Mobile Virtual Network Operator
(“MVNO”) contract connections.

Mobile contract churn is defined as the rate at which contract subscribers relinquish their subscriptions. This
is calculated by dividing the proportion of postpaid contract mobile connections who have terminated their
contract (Consumer, Small-Medium Business, Enterprise and Mobile Broadband) for the period by the average
base.

venture that was formed on June 1, 2021 between Liberty Global Holdings and Telefónica (the “Joint Venture
**Transactions”). Prior to the completion of the Joint Venture Transactions, (i) Virgin Media was a wholly-owned**
subsidiary of Liberty Global Holdings that provided fixed and mobile communications services in the U.K. and
(ii) O2 Holdings was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telefónica that provided mobile communications services in
the U.K.

Virgin Media O2 combines the U.K.’s largest mobile network, with 44.9 million mobile connections and,

business even better for people and the planet. The Better Connections plan centers on the areas where we
believe we can make the greatest positive impact through our products, services, and digital know-how,
underscoring our ambition to help create an inclusive, connected and decarbonized society:

    - A zero carbon future sets out our net zero pathway and how technology can support the shift to a zero
carbon U.K.

    - A circular economy aims to raise awareness of electronic waste (e-waste) and find ways to boost
circularity in our operations.

    - Connected communities addresses our responsibility to tackle data poverty and equip disconnected
people with essential digital skills.

principles are also adopted in our supply chain.

**The Transactions**

The “Transactions” refers to the various transactions as described below, including the issuance of the
Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom.

**_Overview of the Structure of the Offering_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an accession agreement to the Credit Facility, in substantially
the form attached as Annex D to this offering memorandum, with the Credit Facility Borrower and the Credit
Facility Agent (the “Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”), pursuant to which the Issuer will make available
to the Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued in the offering.

The Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other Credit Facility Lenders and will
have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other
Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the Finco Loan
€ granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes to secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights
and protections granted to the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants
contained in the Credit Facility, the guarantees granted by the Credit Facility Guarantors and the Credit Facility
Collateral. See “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing
obligations of the Bank Group (as defined in the Credit Facility) under the Credit Facility, the Issuer will be
treated in the same way as the other Credit Facility Lenders, with the right to vote as part of the lending group on
the basis described in this “Description of the Notes” and to receive principal and interest on the Finco Loan €,
which it will in turn use to make payments on the Notes. For a description of procedures under the Indenture and
the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement relating to the voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to
decisions under the Credit Facility, see “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the
_Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”._

Under the Credit Facility, to the extent the Bank Group is in compliance with certain financial covenants,
the borrowers under the Credit Facility, at their discretion and without the consent of the Credit Facility Lenders,
are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to additional Credit Facility Loans (as defined
in “Description of the Notes”) under the Credit Facility, which benefit from the protections provided to all Credit
Facility Lenders, including the representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security provided
thereunder. For a further description of the Credit Facility, see “Description of the Credit Facility and the
_Related Agreements”. The Credit Facility is attached as Annex A to this offering memorandum._

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer
(if any) from the Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund
a loan (the “Finco Loan €”) borrowed under an additional facility (the “Finco Facility €”) established pursuant
to the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement under the Credit Facility, and the Issuer will become a Credit
Facility Lender.

The principal amount of the Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan €.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Collateral Sharing Agreement that governs the relative
rights of creditors under the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and any Additional Debt of the Issuer that
benefits from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, all
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be shared on a pari passu basis by the holders of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) and the creditors of all Additional Debt of the Issuer that benefits from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis, including the Existing Notes. The Collateral Sharing Agreement sets out,
among other things, (i) the relevant ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, (ii) the consent level of the senior
creditors required to cast votes and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions and remedies under
the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the other debt instruments or agreements sharing in

the Collateral (including the Existing Notes), when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the Collateral
by the Security Trustee and (iii) turnover provisions. The holders and/or lenders, as applicable, of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and all Additional Debt then
outstanding will control any enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral.

**Recent Developments**

**_March 2024 Credit Facility Transactions_**

On March 18, 2024, certain lenders under Facility X1 under the Credit Facility with a maturity date of
September 30, 2027 agreed to extend the maturity of their Facility X1 commitments to September 30, 2029. This
was effected by way of such lenders under Facility X1 converting their respective Facility X1 commitments into
commitments under the new Facility X1A which was established under the additional facility X1A accession
deed dated March 18, 2024, and with a maturity date of September 30, 2029. The residual principal amount of
commitments remaining in Facility X1 is £236.9 million (noting that in addition to the conversion of Facility X1
commitments into commitments under the new Facility X1A described above, certain other Facility X1
commitments totaling £46.8 million have been subject to a debt buyback by the Credit Facility Borrower
completed on March 25, 2024). Facility X1A was established with a principal amount of commitments of
£750.0 million but only £33.7 million was funded in cash.

**_NetCo_**

On February 16, 2024, VMED O2 UK Holdings announced that together with its shareholders, Liberty
Global and Telefónica, it has initiated plans to create a distinct national fixed network company (“NetCo”) that is
intended to underpin full fibre take up and roll out, provide financing optionality and a platform for potential
altnet consolidation opportunities. NetCo will be a fully consolidated subsidiary of VMED O2 UK Holdings and
is expected to have a neutral impact on the VMED O2 UK Holdings’ leverage and credit structure. The
development of NetCo is underway and are subject to necessary regulatory approval. However there can be no
assurance that the development of NetCo will occur in a timely manner or at all.

**Other Transactions**

The Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new credit
facilities, access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management
transactions, including vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured
credit facilities, from time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after, the Issue Date (the
“Potential Financing Transactions”). The cash proceeds, if any, of any Potential Financing Transactions may
be used for the redemption, refinancing, repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness of any member of the
Group, the payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith or the other transactions related thereto,
and/or distributions or other payments to direct or indirect parent companies. The indebtedness under any such
Potential Financing Transactions by the Group would be incurred in compliance with the applicable covenants
under the Credit Facility, the indentures governing the Existing VMED O2 Notes, the Existing Notes and the
Existing VMED O2 Financing Facilities. After giving effect to any such incurrence in compliance with the
applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or
other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant
senior net debt to Annualized EBITDA, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to Annualized EBITDA
could increase above the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to Annualized EBITDA, the ratio of as
adjusted total covenant net debt to Annualized EBITDA presented under “Certain As Adjusted Covenant
_Information”, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and such increases could be material. Any Potential_
Financing Transaction will be made at VMED O2 UK Holdings’ election or the election of its relevant
subsidiaries, and, if any indebtedness incurred thereunder is in the form of securities, such securities may be
offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering memorandum or liability
management documentation. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial
_Matters—We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date,_
_which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the_
_terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness”._

(5) SHA total net debt is calculated in accordance with “Total Net Debt” (as defined in the Joint Venture
Shareholders Agreement) and is adjusted to reflect the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the
application of the proceeds thereof. Total net debt presented here differs from the calculation of “Total Net
Debt” under the Credit Facility and “Indebtedness” under the “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” under
certain of the indentures governing the Existing VMED O2 Notes and the Existing VMED O2 Financing
Facilities. After giving effect to any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a Potential Financing
Transaction in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Finco Loan €

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Deeds of

afforded to other Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in

to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the
Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and

_the Structure—The security interest in the Credit Facility Collateral_
_securing the Finco Loan € will not be granted directly to the holders_
_of the Notes” for more information._

The Collateral Sharing Agreement provides that the security interests
in the Collateral may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the
amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default under
(and as defined in) the Indenture, subject to and in accordance with
the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement. Neither the Trustee
nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take
any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Notes
Security Documents. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may
only take action to enforce the Notes Security Documents through the
Security Trustee and the Collateral Sharing Agreement. In addition,
pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the ability of the
Security Trustee to enforce the security interests in the Collateral will
be restricted and will be at the discretion of the relevant creditors. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Collateral_ _Sharing_ _Agreement”_ for more
information.

**Credit Facility Guarantors . . . . . . . . . .** On the date of this offering memorandum, the Credit Facility
Guarantors are the only guarantors of the obligations of the Obligors
(as defined in the Credit Facility) under the Credit Facility (subject to
certain specified guarantee limitations, including, but not limited to,
the exclusion of liability to the extent that such guarantee would
constitute unlawful financial assistance under applicable law).

In addition, the Credit Facility requires that additional members of the
Bank Group become guarantors under the Credit Facility where
necessary in order to ensure that the aggregate earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Obligors (as defined
in the Credit Facility) (on an unconsolidated basis and excluding
intra-group items) equal or exceed, respectively, 80% of the
consolidated EBITDA (excluding for the purposes of this calculation
any EBITDA attributable to any Joint Venture (as defined in the
Credit Facility)) of the Bank Group (the “Credit Facility 80%
**Security Test”). As of December 31, 2023, after giving effect to the**
Transactions, the Credit Facility Guarantors represented over 80% of
the consolidated total assets of the Group as of December 31, 2023,
and over 80% of the consolidated revenue of the Group for the three
months ended December 31, 2023. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes and the Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations_
_on the Credit Facility Guarantees may adversely affect their validity_
_and enforceability”._

**Credit Facility Collateral . . . . . . . . . . .** The Finco Loan € will be secured by the security interests on all of
the assets of the Obligors (as defined in the Credit Facility) that are
granted to the Credit Facility Security Trustee to secure the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility is, or will be, primarily secured by all or
substantially all assets of the Obligors; provided that, on or after the
Asset Security Release Date (as defined in the Credit Facility), the
security granted to secure the Credit Facility will be limited to
(i) share pledges over all of the capital stock of the Borrowers and the
other Obligors under (and each as defined in) the Credit Facility and
(ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors in relation to certain
intercompany loans. For a description of the Credit Facility
Collateral, see “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related
_Agreements—Credit Facility—Guarantees and Security”._

prepay all outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility. If so
required, the Credit Facility Borrower will prepay the Finco Loan € at
a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Finco Loan €.
Following any such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes
at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of
redemption. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Redemption_ _and_

**Redemption Event”), subject to and in accordance with the terms of**
the Credit Facility and the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the
Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will provide for the payment
of certain additional payments to be made to the Issuer that
correspond to the premiums payable to holders of the Notes upon
early redemption, as described below.

At any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the occurrence of an Early
Redemption Event in respect of the Finco Loan €, the Issuer will
redeem an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the principal
amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid in such Early Redemption Event
(not to exceed an amount equal to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any)),
during each twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date, at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date
of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Optional Redemption”._

At any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the occurrence of an Early

proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (as defined in “Description
_of the Notes”) (the “Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds”),_
the Issuer will redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) equal to the
principal amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid with any Equity
Offering Early Redemption Proceeds, in such Early Redemption
Event, at the redemption price set forth under “Description of the
_Notes— Redemption and Repurchase—Optional Redemption”._

Subject to the foregoing, at any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the
occurrence of an Early Redemption Event in respect of the Finco
Loan €, the Issuer will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the
Notes equal to the principal amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid in
such Early Redemption Event, by paying a “make whole” premium as

_Repurchase—Optional Redemption”._

On or after April 15, 2027, upon the occurrence of an Early

**Optional Redemption with Disposal**
**Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain asset sales, the Credit Facility Borrower may
elect, at its option, to (i) offer to prepay a principal amount of the Finco
Loan € in an aggregate amount equal to the principal amount of the
Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be made by the Issuer
(not to exceed such Finco Loan €’s pro rata share of the amount of the
applicable available proceeds from the related asset sale) or (ii) subject
to the payment of certain premiums, prepay the Finco Loan € on a pro
rata basis in an amount equal to the available proceeds from the related
asset sale, and, in each case, the Issuer will redeem a corresponding

**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments in respect of the Notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental
charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer
will pay Additional Amounts (as defined in the “Description of the
_Notes”) so that the net amount you receive is no less than that which_
you would have received in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, at a price
equal to the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption,
in the event of an optional prepayment of a Finco Loan € pursuant to
clause 10.4 (Right of Repayment and Cancellation in Relation to a

impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the Notes,
and, as a result, the Issuer is required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such withholding taxes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption_ _and_ _Repurchases—Redemption_ _for_ _Changes_ _in_
_Withholding Taxes”._

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture. The Indenture

listing, minimum period for consents under loan documents,
payments for consent, amendments to loan documents to be applied
equally to all lenders, information and impairment of liens. See
“Description of the Notes”.

**Voting in respect of the Finco Loan €**
**and the Credit Facility . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will vote as a Credit Facility Lender pursuant to the Finco
Facility € Accession Agreement. The voting method to be used to

The above description is intended to summarize certain material
amendments included in the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement
but is not complete and does not restate the Credit Facility
Amendments in their entirety. Given the significant nature of these
amendments, you should read the Credit Facility Amendments set
forth in Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 to the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement (in the form attached as Annex D to this offering
memorandum) in their entirety before investing in the Notes.

The Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective
upon the approval by lenders constituting the “Instructing Group” (as
currently defined in the Credit Facility, without giving effect to the
Credit Facility Amendments). However, certain of the Credit Facility
Amendments, including those related to extending the date of any
payment and releasing guarantors and collateral, will become
effective only upon the approval of all Credit Facility Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from Credit Facility Lenders
under the Credit Facility and the other creditors under certain
financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group
Intercreditor Deed and the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed
will cease to govern the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2
Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor
Agreement will establish the relative rights of the Credit Facility
Lenders, the holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes
and certain creditors under other financing arrangements of the
Group.

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other Credit
Facility Lenders. In the event that the Issuer, as a Credit Facility
Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)
(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to
any matter arising from time to time under the Credit Facility or
under the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, as applicable, in
which all Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required
to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other
consents) from holders of Notes and any other applicable series of
Additional Debt (including the Existing Notes) with respect to such
Credit Facility Decision (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. However, the Issuer
will, under (and effective as of the date of) the Finco Facility €
Accession Agreement, on behalf of holders of the Notes, provide its
consent as a Credit Facility Lender to any and all of the Credit
Facility Amendments. The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder
Consent equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding in respect of any of the Credit Facility Amendments for
the purposes of the provisions of the Indenture described under
“Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To
_the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”. As_
a result, the Issuer will not solicit votes (or other consents) from the
holders of the Notes with respect to the Credit Facility Amendments.

In addition, the Issuer will not be entitled to receive, and will
expressly waive under the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, any

right it may have to any consent, waiver, amendment or other similar
fee that may be paid to other Credit Facility Lenders in connection
with their approval of the Credit Facility Amendments (although the
Issuer will generally be required to be paid the same consent fees paid
to other Credit Facility Lenders with respect to other amendments).
See “Description of the Notes—Finco Facility € Accession Agreement
_and the Credit Facility” and “Description of the Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Payments_ _for_ _Consent”_ and “Risk _Factors—Risks_

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State
of New York.

The Credit Facility, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the
Related Agreements, the Intercreditor Deeds, the Collateral Sharing
Agreement and the Notes Security Documents are or will be governed
by the laws of England and Wales.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** U.S. Bank Trustees Limited.

**Paying Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch.

**Listing Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Ogier Corporate Finance Limited.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may only be
offered or sold by you pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of, or in transactions not subject to, the U.S. Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
market. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so, and may discontinue market-making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to the Authority for admission of the Notes

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes,
together with certain amounts received under the Finco Facility € Fee
Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund the Finco Loan € to the
Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the Credit Facility. We intend to
use the gross proceeds of the Finco Loan € (i) to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes, and (ii) in one
or more transactions, towards the refinancing of certain existing


21

senior secured indebtedness of the Group, which may occur, by way
of open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender
offers, repayments, prepayments, redemptions, or otherwise, and to
pay any related fees, premiums and expenses in connection therewith
(the “Refinancing Transactions”). We expect that the Refinancing
Transactions will be undertaken over a period of time and any such
Refinancing Transactions will be on such terms and at such times as
the Group may determine in its sole discretion.

In accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework, the Joint
Venture intends to use an amount equal to the net proceeds of the
Finco Loan € to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED
O2 Eligible Green Projects and to pay fees and expenses in relation
thereto. Accordingly, on August 5, 2022, Sustainalytics, a provider of
ESG research and analysis, evaluated the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework and certified that it aligns with the 2021 Green Bond
Principles and provided views on the robustness and credibility of the
VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (which views are intended to
inform investors in general, and not for a specific investor). See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes_
_may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to_
_“green” assets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and_
_the Structure—Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to_
_allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the_
_Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2_
_Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements_
_and other undertakings”._

**Certain Tax Considerations . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue
discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation
generally is treated as having been issued with original issue discount
if its stated redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by at
least a de minimis amount. If a Note is treated as issued with original
issue discount, U.S. investors will be subject to tax on that original
issue discount as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
payments attributable to that income (and in addition to stated
interest). You are urged to consult your own tax advisors with respect
to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax considerations related
to purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes. For a discussion of
certain material U.S. federal income tax and certain U.K. tax
considerations, see “Certain _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_
_Considerations”_ _and_ _“Certain_ _Material_ _United_ _Kingdom_ _Tax_
_Considerations”._

**Certain ERISA Considerations . . . . . .** The Notes and/or any interest therein may, subject to certain
restrictions, be sold and transferred to ERISA Plans (as defined
herein). See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. Please see “Risk
_Factors” in this offering memorandum and “Quantitative and_
_Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in the 2023 Annual Bond_
Report incorporated by reference herein for a description of certain
risks that you should carefully consider before investing in the Notes.


22


-----

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the_
_specific risk factors set forth below or incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum, as well as the_
_other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. If any of the risks_
_described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse impact on our_
_business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and could therefore have a negative_
_effect on the trading price of the Notes, the Credit Facility Obligors’ ability to pay all or part of the interest,_
_principal or other amounts on the Finco Loan € and, in turn, the Issuer’s ability to pay all or part of the interest,_
_principal or other amounts on the Notes._

_We also incorporate by reference the risk factors listed under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures_
_about Market Risk” in the 2023 Annual Bond Report. Although the risk factors incorporated by reference or_
_described below and elsewhere in this document are the risks considered to be the most material, there may be_
_other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have_
_material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In_
_addition, the past financial performance of VMED O2 UK Holdings may not be a reliable indicator of our future_
_performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Additional_
_risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below described below and elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum, or in the risk factors incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the_
_extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional_
_advisors to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of_
_investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their_
_own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting._

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial Matters**

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which_**
**_indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of_**
**_the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of
our existing debt, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our
financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and may decide to enter into new
credit facilities, access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management
transactions, including vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured
credit facilities, from time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after the Issue Date. Any such
offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election or the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and if such
debt is in the form of securities, may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate
offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the
pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes
and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would
have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of
any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later
than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be
as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise
any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as
to the timing of such offering or incurrence, or the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new
debt in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as
described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
_Market Risk” in the 2023 Annual Bond Report incorporated by reference herein, could intensify._

23

**_Base Erosion and Profit Shifting._**

Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project undertaken by the Organizational Economic Cooperation and
Development (“OECD”). The OECD represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. In October 2021, the OECD announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework
of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to reform international taxation. Pillar
One provides a mechanism to align taxing rights more closely with local market engagement; generally, where
people or consumers are located. Pillar Two establishes a global minimum tax regime through a series of
interlocking rules that would apply when a country’s income tax rate is below 15%. The Pillar Two rules came
into effect into the U.K. at the end of 2023 with the income inclusion rule applying to accounting periods
beginning on or after December 31, 2023 and the undertaxed profits rule taking effect for years beginning from
December 31, 2024. We are reviewing the impact on our business but this could result in increased tax liabilities
and administrative cost. The U.K. could react to the BEPS initiatives or their own concerns by enacting tax
legislation that could adversely affect our financial position through increasing our tax liabilities. Further, the
BEPS project as well as legislative changes in many countries, has resulted in various initiatives that require the
sharing of company financial and operation information with taxing authorities on a local or global basis. This
may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries as well as disagreements between
jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between jurisdictions.

**_We are not obligated to complete the Refinancing Transactions within a defined timeframe and such_**
**_Refinancing Transactions are still to be determined and there can be no assurance that our efforts with_**
**_respect to such Refinancing Transactions will be successful on the terms or pricing reasonably satisfactory to_**
**_us._**

We intend to consummate the Refinancing Transactions in the future but we are not obligated to complete
such Refinancing Transactions within a defined timeframe. There is no assurance given as to the timing, the
specific transactions, the terms or which existing senior secured indebtedness would be refinanced pursuant to
such Refinancing Transactions. We cannot guarantee our efforts with respect to the Refinancing Transactions
will be successful on the terms or pricing reasonably satisfactory to us.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure**

**_The Issuer is a financing company which will depend on payments under the Finco Loan € to provide it with_**
**_funds to meet its obligations under the Notes._**

The Issuer has been formed as a financing company for the primary purpose of issuing the Notes and the
Existing Notes, entering into the Finco Loan € and issuing or incurring certain other indebtedness. The Issuer is a
financing company that has no material business operations, no direct subsidiaries and no employees, and,
following the Issue Date, its only material assets will be its rights under the Finco Loan €, the Related
Agreements, the Existing Finco Loans and certain other related agreements. Furthermore, the Indenture will
prohibit the Issuer from engaging in any activities other than certain limited activities permitted under the
heading “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the
_Issuer”. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments from the Credit Facility Borrower, which_
payments are guaranteed by the Credit Facility Guarantors, under the Finco Loan €, other than certain amounts
due on the Notes (such as prepayment premiums and additional amounts following certain tax events), which will
be financed by the Credit Facility Borrower and/or VMIH pursuant to the relevant Related Agreement, in order
to service its obligations under the Notes.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s future obligations that are secured by assets_**
**_or property that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer that are
secured by assets or property that does not secure the Notes, such that in the event of insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary, all of the Issuer’s creditors secured by
assets or property that do not secure the Notes would be entitled to payment in full before the Issuer would be
entitled to any payment.

24


-----

**_Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to the Issuer, as payments under the Notes are limited to the_**
**_amount of certain payments received by the Issuer under the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement will be limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the Issuer
under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be made only from and to the extent of
such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer under the Credit Facility, the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement and the Related Agreements, and other than under the limited circumstances described
below under “Description of the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”, none of the Trustee, the Security
Trustee or the holders of Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event that the
amount due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement exceeds the amounts so received under the Credit Facility, the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement and the Related Agreements.

The Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not be permitted to take any action, commence any proceeding
or petition a court for the liquidation of the Issuer, nor will they be permitted to enter into any arrangement,
reorganization or insolvency proceeding in relation to the Issuer, whether under the laws of England and Wales
or other applicable bankruptcy laws. The obligations of the Issuer are solely obligations of the Issuer, and the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not have any recourse against any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Issuer for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, indemnities or other obligations whatsoever
in connection with any transactions contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement and the related documents. Having realized the Collateral securing the Notes and distributed
the net proceeds thereof, in each case in accordance with the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement,
none of the Trustee, the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes may take any further steps to recover any
sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, any of the Notes Security Documents or the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or otherwise and all claims against the Issuer in respect of any such sum due but still unpaid
shall be extinguished.

**_The Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantors conduct no business operations of_**
**_their own. The Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantors will depend on_**
**_payments from the other members of the Group to make payments on the Finco Loan €._**

The Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantors conduct no business operations of
their own. The ability of any members of the Bank Group to pay dividends or to make other payments or
advances to the Credit Facility Borrower and such Credit Facility Guarantors depends on their individual
operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become
subject and in some cases the Credit Facility Borrower’s and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantors’ receipt of
such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Most of the Bank Group’s operating
subsidiaries are, or will be, subject to the limitations and restrictions in the Credit Facility and/or other debt
facilities that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions,
loans or advances to stockholders and partners, including the Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the Credit
Facility Guarantors. In addition, because these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, they have no
obligation to provide the Credit Facility Borrower and the Credit Facility Guarantors funds for payment
obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments, except for those subsidiaries which are
Credit Facility Guarantors. If the members of the Bank Group are unable to make distributions or other payments
to the Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantors, the Credit Facility Borrower and
such Credit Facility Guarantors expect to have no other sources of funds that would allow them to make
payments under the Finco Loan € or the Related Agreements and, in turn, allow the Issuer to make payments
under the Notes.

There can be no assurance that arrangements with the Bank Group entities and the funding permitted by the
agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Bank Group will provide the Credit Facility
Borrower and the Credit Facility Guarantors with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments
under the relevant Finco Loan € or the Related Agreements, and in turn, fund payments by the Issuer under the
Notes, when due.

**_Holders of the Notes have limited direct recourse to the Credit Facility Obligors._**

Except for the specific interests of the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender under the Credit Facility or as
otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, no proprietary or other direct interest in the Issuer’s rights under
or in respect of the Credit Facility exists for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Further, subject to the terms

25


-----

of the Indenture, no holder of Notes can enforce any provision of the Credit Facility or have direct recourse to the
Credit Facility Obligors, or any other member of the Bank Group, except through an action by the Issuer, itself
acting as directed by the Trustee pursuant to the rights granted to the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee under
and in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

Under the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be required to take proceedings to enforce payment under the
Credit Facility unless it has been indemnified and/or secured by the holders of the Notes to its satisfaction and
subject further to such enforcement being instructed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing
Agreement, which will provide that the holders and/or the lenders, as applicable, of the majority in the aggregate
principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and Additional Debt outstanding which share the
benefit of the Collateral, will control any enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral. In addition, none of the
Issuer, the Trustee or the Security Trustee is required to monitor any member of the Bank Group’s financial or
contractual performance.

**_By investing in the Notes you will have provided advance consent to the Credit Facility Amendments which_**
**_will automatically become effective without any further consent from holders of the Notes upon VMIH_**
**_obtaining the consent of either the Instructing Group (as defined in the Credit Facility) or, with respect to_**
**_certain amendments, all Credit Facility Lenders._**

The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement contains the consent of the Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, to
the Credit Facility Amendments. Accordingly, while the Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other
Credit Facility Lenders in all matters under the Credit Facility, the Issuer will have already provided its consent
to any and all of the Credit Facility Amendments at the time it enters into the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement, as applicable and, therefore, it will not be entitled to vote on any request for consent to the Credit
Facility Amendments. As a result, the holders of Notes will not, directly or indirectly, be entitled to direct the
vote of the Issuer on such matters in the event VMIH solicits the consents for any or all of these amendments to
the Credit Facility or receive any consent fee or similar fee that may be paid to other Credit Facility Lenders
under the Credit Facility in connection with their approval of these amendments.

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility. In
the event that the Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)
(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter arising from time to time under
the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, as applicable, in which the Issuer or all Credit
Facility Lenders are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other
consents) from the holders of the Notes and any other applicable series of Additional Debt with respect to such
Credit Facility Decision (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture.

The Issuer will, under (and effective as of the date of) the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, on behalf
of holders of the Notes, provide its consent as a Credit Facility Lender, to any and all of the Credit Facility
Amendments (notwithstanding that the Issuer may otherwise be eligible to vote as a Credit Facility Lender if
VMIH sought the consent of the Credit Facility Lenders with respect to such matters). The Issuer will therefore
apply Noteholder Consent (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”) equal to the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes outstanding in respect of any and all of the Credit Facility Amendments for the purposes of the
provisions of the Indenture described below under “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver—To the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”. As a result, the Issuer will not_
solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the Notes with respect to the Credit Facility Amendments. In
addition, the Issuer will not be entitled to receive, and will expressly waive under the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement, any right it may have to, any consent, waiver, amendment or other similar fee that may be paid to
other Credit Facility Lenders in connection with their approval of the Credit Facility Amendments (including the
Issuer in respect of any additional Finco Facility Accession Agreement, or similar instrument or agreement,
pursuant to which the Issuer advances the proceeds of Additional Debt (including any Additional Notes) into the
Bank Group).

The Credit Facility Amendments include material modifications to certain affirmative and negative
covenants, financial maintenance covenants and related definitions, representations and warranties, events of
default, administrative provisions and provisions relating to the security package securing the Credit Facility and
the approval of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (in substantially the form attached as Annex C to this
offering memorandum). The Credit Facility Amendments are generally less restrictive and provide greater
flexibility to the Bank Group than the provisions currently included in the Credit Facility. For a summary of the
key amendments included in the Credit Facility Amendments, please see “Description of the Credit Facility and

26


-----

_the Related Agreements—Credit Facility—Proposed Amendments to the Credit Facility”. Given the significant_
nature of these amendments, you should read the full list of amendments set out in Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 to
the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement in their entirety before investing in the Notes.

The Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective upon the approval by lenders constituting
the Instructing Group (as currently defined in the Credit Facility, without giving effect to the Credit Facility
Amendments). However, certain of the Credit Facility Amendments, including those related to extending the date
of any payment and releasing guarantors and collateral, will become effective only upon the approval of all
Credit Facility Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility and the other
creditors under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the
terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2
Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (which takes effect by way of
amendment and restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will establish the relative rights of the Credit
Facility Lenders, the holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors under other
financing arrangements of the Group.

**_The security interest in the Credit Facility Collateral securing the Finco Loan € will not be granted directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Credit Facility Collateral securing the Finco Loan € will not be granted directly
to holders of the Notes. Instead, they will be granted in favor of the Credit Facility Security Trustee for the
benefit of the Credit Facility Lenders, including the Issuer under the Finco Loan €, and the Issuer’s interest in the
Finco Loan € will in turn serve as Collateral for the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes.

As a result, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes, the Trustee on behalf of the holders
of the Notes will not have the right to enforce the collateral for the Finco Loan € directly but, instead, would only
have the right, through the Security Trustee (and subject to the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement), to
enforce the security interest in the Issuer’s interest in the Finco Loan € (subject always to the Trustee and/ or the
Security Trustee, as applicable, being directed by the holders of the Notes and indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction against any liabilities it may incur, and subject further to such enforcement being instructed in
accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement, which will provide that the holders and/or the
lenders, as applicable, of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional
Notes) and Additional Debt outstanding which share the benefit of the Collateral, will control any enforcement
actions in respect of the Collateral, including the Finco Loan €). This indirect claim over the Credit Facility
Collateral could delay or make more costly any realization of such Credit Facility Collateral.

**_The Issuer will share all security equally and ratably with the other Credit Facility Lenders, holders of our_**
**_Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and certain additional secured indebtedness we will be permitted by_**
**_the Credit Facility to incur in the future. If there is a default, the value of the Credit Facility Collateral may_**
**_not be sufficient to repay the Issuer under the Finco Loan € and the lenders under such other indebtedness._**

The Finco Loan € and the Credit Facility Guarantees are secured equally and ratably with the other
borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and additional secured
indebtedness permitted by the Credit Facility to be incurred in the future, subject to compliance with covenants in
our outstanding debt agreements. The Credit Facility will permit the incurrence of additional secured
indebtedness which would share the Credit Facility Collateral equally and ratably with the Finco Loan €. As a
result, if there is a default, the remaining security may not be sufficient to repay the Issuer as a Credit Facility
Lender and the other lenders under any such additional secured indebtedness.

**_The value of the Credit Facility Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Credit Facility_**
**_Obligors under the Finco Loan €._**

No appraisal of the value of the Credit Facility Collateral securing the Finco Loan € has been made in
connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Credit Facility Collateral is subject to fluctuations
based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be
received upon a sale of the Credit Facility Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not
limited to, the actual fair market value of the Credit Facility Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of
the sale and the availability of buyers. By their nature, portions of the Credit Facility Collateral may be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or

27


-----

similar proceeding, the Credit Facility Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner. The proceeds
from any sale or liquidation of the security will generally be used to repay all senior secured indebtedness,
including the outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes on
a pro rata basis, and may not be sufficient to pay the Credit Facility Borrower’s obligations under the Finco Loan
€ or the Credit Facility Guarantors’ guarantees thereof.

**_The Credit Facility Collateral securing the Finco Loan € is subject to casualty risks._**

Some of the Credit Facility Collateral securing the Credit Facility is either uninsurable or not economically
insurable, in whole or in part. Consequently, we may not be fully compensated by insurance proceeds for any
losses we may suffer. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Credit Facility Collateral, the insurance
proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy the Group’s senior secured obligations, including the Credit Facility and
the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes.

**_The Finco Loan € will be secured over substantially the same assets that secure the Credit Facility and the_**
**_Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer may not control actions relating to enforcement of_**
**_the Credit Facility Collateral._**

The rights of the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender with respect to the Credit Facility Collateral will be
subject to our Group Intercreditor Deed. Under the Group Intercreditor Deed, any enforcement actions that may
be taken with respect to the Credit Facility Collateral will be controlled by the Credit Facility Security Trustee.
The Credit Facility Security Trustee is required to take enforcement action upon receiving instructions from an
instructing group of holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all our liabilities that
qualify as “Senior Liabilities” under (and as defined in) our Group Intercreditor Deed which includes any
Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding, the Finco Loan € and other borrowings under
the Credit Facility. As a result, in the event of a default, we anticipate that actions relating to enforcement of the
Credit Facility Collateral may not be controlled by the Issuer. See “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds—
_Group Intercreditor Deed”. Upon receipt of the required consents from Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit_
Facility and the other creditors under certain of our other financing arrangements, the terms of the Group
Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern rights of the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender with respect to the Credit
Facility Collateral and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (which takes effect by way of
amendment and restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will instead establish the relative rights of the
Credit Facility Lenders and certain creditors under other financing arrangements of the Group. See “Description
_of the Intercreditor Deeds—New Group Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_Holders of the Notes are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale_**
**_on a pari passu basis with any Additional Debt of the Issuer, and the value of the Collateral may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes._**

Holders of the Notes will benefit directly from security interests granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of
itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has
been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations
based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be
received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the
actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability
of buyers. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not
be sold in a timely or orderly manner. The proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the security will generally be
used to repay the Notes and any other existing or future senior secured Additional Debt of the Issuer that is not
subordinated to the Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_**
**_released without your consent._**

The security for the benefit of the Notes in the Collateral may be released under various circumstances,
including following an Event of Default (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture or a
default under other Additional Debt of the Issuer secured by the Collateral, pursuant to an enforcement action
and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement at the direction of the relevant instructing
group thereunder. The Indenture also permits amendments to any Notes Security Documents or the provisions of
the Indenture dealing with Notes Security Documents, which are, taken as a whole, materially adverse to the

28


-----

holders of the Notes or otherwise release the Collateral with the consent of at least 75% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes. In addition, in connection with any Additional Debt that can be incurred and
secured by the same Collateral, the security over the Collateral may be released and retaken which may lead to
renewed hardening periods and may limit your recovery in an enforcement proceeding.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Finco Loan € under which the Credit_**
**_Facility Collateral will be released without the consent of either the Issuer or holders of the Notes._**

The Credit Facility Collateral for the benefit of the Credit Facility Lenders may be released under various
circumstances, including (i) upon a sale or other disposal permitted by the terms of the Credit Facility, (ii) upon
any release in connection with an enforcement action by the Credit Facility Security Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed acting at the direction of the Instructing Group or (iii) in the case of Credit
Facility Collateral owned by a Credit Facility Guarantor, when such Credit Facility Guarantor is released from its
Credit Facility Guarantee. The Credit Facility Collateral includes liens on substantially all of the assets of VMIH
and each other Credit Facility Guarantor (collectively, the “Credit Facility Asset Collateral”). The Credit
Facility Asset Collateral will, however, be automatically released without the need for any consent from the
Issuer or holders of the Notes on the Asset Security Release Date and replaced with share charges over all of the
capital stock of the Credit Facility Obligors. The Credit Facility also permits amendments to any Security
Documents (as defined therein) or the provisions of the Credit Facility dealing with Security Documents, which
may be, when taken as a whole, materially adverse to Credit Facility Lenders or the release of all or substantially
all of the Credit Facility Collateral with the consent of the Instructing Group (which may not include the Issuer).
In addition, in connection with any additional secured indebtedness that can be incurred, the Credit Facility
Collateral may be released and retaken which may lead to renewed hardening periods in various jurisdictions and
may limit recovery in enforcement proceedings.

**_Your rights in the Collateral and the Issuer’s rights in the Credit Facility Collateral may be adversely affected_**
**_by the failure to perfect certain security interests in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest
can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Trustee, the Security
Trustee and the Credit Facility Security Trustee will not monitor, or we may not inform the Trustee, the Security
Trustee or the Credit Facility Security Trustee of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute
Collateral or Credit Facility Collateral, as applicable, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect
such after-acquired security interest. The Trustee, the Security Trustee and the Credit Facility Security Trustee
have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or Credit
Facility Collateral, as applicable, or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes or the Finco Loan
€, as applicable, against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the
priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes or the Finco Loan €, as applicable, against third parties.

**_Certain assets are excluded from the Credit Facility Collateral._**

Certain assets are excluded from the security for the benefit of the Finco Loan € under the Credit Facility
Collateral, including:

    - any security for purchase money indebtedness or capitalized lease obligations;

    - any assets secured pursuant to certain liens permitted under the Credit Facility;

    - interests in certain excluded subsidiaries, non-recourse special purpose vehicles and joint ventures; and

    - any assets that are expressly excluded from the Credit Facility Collateral securing the Credit Facility or
any other indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Finco Loan € and our Credit Facility which is
outstanding from time to time.

If an event of default occurs and the Finco Loan € are accelerated, the Finco Loan € will rank equally with
all of our other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities with respect to such excluded
assets. As a result, if the value of the Credit Facility Collateral granted in respect of the Finco Loan € and the
Credit Facility Guarantees is less than the value of the claims of the Issuer, no assurance can be provided that the
Issuer would receive any substantial recovery from the excluded assets.

29


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Finco Loan € under which the Credit_**
**_Facility Guarantees will be released automatically, without the Issuer’s consent._**

Each Credit Facility Guarantee by a Credit Facility Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged, and each Credit Facility Guarantor and its obligations under such Credit Facility
Guarantee, the Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Deeds will be released and discharged in certain
circumstances including, without limitation, certain sales, exchanges, transfers or dispositions of such Credit
Facility Guarantor (resulting in such Credit Facility Guarantor no longer being within the Bank Group) or all or
substantially all of the assets of such Credit Facility Guarantor. In addition, Credit Facility Guarantees may be
released in certain other circumstances, including, without limitation, in connection with a Post-Closing
Reorganization and/or a Permitted Tax Reorganization (each as defined in the Credit Facility). Furthermore, any
Credit Facility Guarantee may be released with the consent of the Instructing Group (which may not require the
consent of the Issuer). As a result of these and other provisions in the Credit Facility, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts from the Credit Facility Guarantors under the Credit Facility Guarantees in the event of a
default on the Finco Loan € and certain of the Credit Facility Guarantees may be released without any alternative
recovery being available.

**_The Finco Loan € will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of the Credit Facility Obligors’_**
**_respective subsidiaries that are not Credit Facility Obligors and will be effectively subordinated to any of the_**
**_Credit Facility Obligors’ existing and future obligations that are secured by liens senior to the liens securing_**
**_the Finco Loan € or the Credit Facility Guarantees or assets or property that do not secure the Finco Loan_**
**_€ or the Credit Facility Guarantees._**

Since none of the Credit Facility Obligors’ subsidiaries (which are not themselves Credit Facility
Guarantors) will guarantee the Finco Loan € on the Issue Date, the Finco Loan € and the Credit Facility
Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of such subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit
Facility will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which
may also be secured, and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables,
that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Consequently, creditors of such additional indebtedness are entitled to
payments of their claims from the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to any Credit Facility Guarantor. Moreover, in the event that any non-guarantor
subsidiary become insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, the creditors of the Credit Facility Guarantors
(including the Issuer and other Credit Facility Lenders) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s
assets and the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary will generally be entitled to payment in full from the
sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Credit Facility Guarantor will be entitled to
receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Finco Loan € and the Credit Facility Guarantees will
each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any)
of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

In addition, the Finco Loan € and/or the Credit Facility Guarantees, as applicable, will be effectively
subordinated to any secured indebtedness of the relevant Credit Facility Obligor that is secured by liens senior to
the liens securing the Finco Loan € or the Credit Facility Guarantees, or secured by property or assets that do not
secure the Finco Loan € or the Credit Facility Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness. Although the Credit Facility contains restrictions on the ability of the respective
subsidiaries of the Credit Facility Obligors to incur additional debt as well as on the ability of the Credit Facility
Obligors to incur additional secured debt, any additional debt or additional secured debt incurred may be
substantial.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Credit Facility Guarantees may adversely affect their validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

Certain of the Credit Facility Obligors (including the Credit Facility Borrower) and certain of the other
members of the Bank Group are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, insolvency
proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English
insolvency law. In addition, English insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In addition, certain Credit Facility Obligors
are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, applicable insolvency laws in such jurisdictions and
limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts would limit the enforceability of

30


-----

judgments against the Credit Facility Obligors. The following discussion of insolvency law, although an
overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdictions’
insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Credit Facility Guarantors or an appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Credit Facility Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally,
as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes
certain findings, to:

    - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Credit Facility Guarantor’s obligations under its Credit Facility
Guarantee;

    - direct that the Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) return any amounts paid under a Credit
Facility Guarantee to the relevant Credit Facility Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the relevant
Credit Facility Guarantor’s creditors; and

    - take other action that is detrimental to Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) and, indirectly,
holders of the Notes.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Credit Facility
Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Credit Facility Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the
method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or
that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on the
date its Credit Facility Guarantee was issued, that payments to the Issuer under the Finco Loan € to, in turn, make
payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

In the event that the validity or enforceability of the Credit Facility Guarantees is adversely affected, we
cannot assure you that the Issuer will ever be able to repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

Furthermore, under English insolvency law, some of our and our subsidiaries’ debts may be entitled to
priority, including amounts owed in respect of various U.K. social security contributions, amounts owed in
respect of occupational pension schemes, certain amounts owed to employees and liquidation expenses. The
Insolvency Act 1986, as amended by the Finance Act 2020, provides that, with respect to all insolvencies
commencing on or after December 1, 2020, claims by HMRC dating from before the onset of the relevant
company’s insolvency in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan
repayments), employee national insurance contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but
excluding corporation tax and employer national insurance contributions) which are held by the company on
behalf of employees and customers will also be entitled to priority.

**_Laws relating to preferences and transactions at an undervalue may adversely affect the validity and_**
**_enforceability of payments under the Credit Facility Guarantees by the Credit Facility Guarantors._**

A significant number of the Credit Facility Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to
the court to challenge transactions entered into by that company if the company was unable to pay its debts (as
defined in the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of the transaction or if the company became unable to pay its
debts as a result of the transaction. Generally, only an administrator or liquidator of a company may bring a claim
challenging a reviewable transaction. For example, transactions that can be challenged include preferences and
transactions at an undervalue.

A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company
making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the
company received significantly less value (in money or money’s worth) than it gave in return. The court can set
aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending with the
onset of insolvency. A court generally will not intervene in circumstances where a company entered into the
transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of
the Notes that in the event of insolvency the Credit Facility Guarantees would not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that the guarantees have been entered into in good
faith for the purposes described above.

31


-----

A transaction might be challenged as a preference where, in the event of the relevant company going into
insolvent liquidation, the relevant company has done something or suffered something to be done which has the
effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position than the creditor, surety or guarantor would
have otherwise been in. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to prefer that party. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety
or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what
it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments under
the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific
circumstances for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted
in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and
that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which case it is presumed that the
company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there
was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the preference is given to a person
connected to the company (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), the court looks
back and sets aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of
the company’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only go back and set
aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency.

If a court voided any Credit Facility Guarantee, or any payment thereunder, as a result of a transaction at an
undervalue or a preference, or held it unenforceable or set it aside for any other reason (including by reason of
fraudulent transfer or conveyance), the Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) would cease to have any
claim against the applicable Credit Facility Guarantor under its Credit Facility Guarantee. In such circumstances,
if the Credit Facility Borrower cannot satisfy its obligations under the Finco Loan €, we cannot assure you that
the Issuer will be able to ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_An active trading market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, and the price of the Notes may_**
**_fluctuate._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer intends to make an application for listing on the Official List
of The International Stock Exchange and admission to trading on The International Stock Exchange, but the
Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer can no longer maintain the
listing on Official List of The International Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or
maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, preparation of financial statements in accordance with any
accounting standard other than the standard pursuant to which the Issuer then prepares its financial statements
shall be deemed unduly burdensome), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on Official List of
The International Stock Exchange, provided that the Issuer will use all reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the
European Union or the U.K.), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing (whether on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield
issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest
payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

The Notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. If a trading market
does not develop, or if a trading market develops but is not maintained, holders of the Notes may experience
difficulty in reselling the Notes or may be unable to sell them at all. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of the
Notes that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if a market develops, will be maintained or as
to the liquidity of the market for the Notes.

The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, the interest of
securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the
development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If there is no active trading market for the Notes, the
market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount to their initial issue price depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
general economic conditions, our performance and business prospects and certain other factors.

32


-----

Factors including the following may have a significant effect on the market price of the Notes:

    - actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including our ability to generate cash flow
from operations;

    - our perceived business prospects;

    - our ability or perceived ability to access capital markets and other sources of financing in the future;

    - general economic conditions, including prevailing interest rates; and

    - the market for similar securities.

**_The VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer and certain other holding companies will not be subject to the covenants_**
**_in the Credit Facility._**

The VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer will guarantee the Credit Facility, but will not be directly subject to the
covenants in the Credit Facility. As a result, the Credit Facility will not restrict the ability of the VMED O2
Senior Notes Issuer to incur additional debt (secured or unsecured), sell, encumber or dispose of assets, pay
dividends, make other distributions or enter into transactions with its affiliates. In addition, certain intermediate
holding companies will not be parties to the Credit Facility and so are not subject to these restrictions. Any such
transactions by any of these entities could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the VMED O2 Senior
Notes Issuer to make payments in respect of its Credit Facility Guarantee.

**_The Issuer’s ability to enforce its rights under the Credit Facility, including the right to accelerate payments_**
**_under the Finco Loan € following the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility is limited._**

The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility will not automatically result in the Finco
Loan € becoming due and payable. Only the Credit Facility Agent may take enforcement steps upon the
occurrence of such an event of default. The Credit Facility Agent may, and must if so instructed by the
Instructing Group under (and as defined in) the Credit Facility, accelerate amounts due under the Credit Facility
(including under the Finco Loan €) following the occurrence of such an event of default. The Issuer’s share in
outstanding loans and undrawn commitments under the Credit Facility is likely to contribute significantly less
than the threshold required for such Instructing Group definition, which is generally more than 50% of the
aggregate of all outstanding loans and undrawn commitments under the Credit Facility. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the Issuer will be able to require an acceleration of its rights under the Finco Loan € following
the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility.

**_The Credit Facility Borrower may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance required_**
**_prepayments of the Credit Facility (including prepayment of the Finco Loan €), and the Issuer therefore may_**
**_not be able to obtain funds to repurchase the Notes, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined_**
**_in the Credit Facility)._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and if the Instructing Group thereunder so requires, the Credit
Facility Borrower will be required to prepay the Credit Facility (including the Finco Loan €), and the Credit
Facility Borrower will be required to make an additional payment to the Issuer equal to 1% of the principal
amount of the relevant Finco Loan €. Following any such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption. Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to a
redemption in connection with a Change of Control unless the Instructing Group under the Credit Facility
requires that the Credit Facility Borrower prepay the Credit Facility and as a result the Issuer may not control
actions relating to prepayment of the Credit Facility in the event of a Change of Control.

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at
such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the
relevant Finco Loan €, or that the restrictions in the Existing VMED O2 Financing Facilities, the indentures
governing the Existing VMED O2 Notes, the indentures governing the Existing Notes or our other existing
contractual obligations would allow us, to make such required prepayment. A Change of Control may result in an
event of default under, or acceleration of, the Existing VMED O2 Financing Facilities, the Existing VMED O2
Notes, the Existing Notes and other indebtedness of the Group. The acceleration or prepayment of the Finco
Loan € could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not.

33


-----

The ability of the Credit Facility Borrower to receive cash from its subsidiaries or other members of the
Group to allow the Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the Finco Loan € (and in turn for the Issuer to redeem the
Notes), following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources.
Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required prepayment. If an event constituting
a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Credit Facility
Borrower for the purpose of prepaying the Finco Loan €, we may seek the consent of the creditors under such
indebtedness to prepay the Finco Loan € (and in turn for the Issuer to repurchase the Notes) or may attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained
or such refinancing cannot be consummated, the Credit Facility Borrower will remain prohibited from prepaying
the Finco Loan €. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make a prepayment of the
Finco Loan € upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. Any
failure by the Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the Finco Loan € would constitute a default under the Credit
Facility which would, in turn, constitute a default under the indentures governing the Existing VMED O2 Notes,
the Existing Notes and the Indenture. See “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—
_Credit Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—Mandatory Prepayment”._

The Change of Control provision contained in the Credit Facility may not necessarily afford the Credit
Facility Lenders, and in turn holders of the Notes, protection in the event of certain important corporate events,
including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, a spin-off of the reference entity for purposes of the definition
of “Change of Control” to the shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings in such reference entity or other
similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect the Credit Facility Lenders, and in turn holders of the
Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if
they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Credit Facility.

Except as described under “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—Credit
_Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—Mandatory Prepayment”, the Credit Facility will not contain_
provisions that would require the Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the Finco Loan €, and in turn the Issuer to
redeem the Notes, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization, spin-off or similar
transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Credit Facility includes a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of VMIH, any Permitted Affiliate Parent (including the Credit Facility Borrower) and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person (other than a Permitted Holder) (each as defined in the Credit
Facility). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no
precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of VMIH, the Credit Facility Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Credit Facility) taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
has occurred and whether the Credit Facility Borrower is required to prepay the Finco Loan €, and in turn
whether the Issuer is required to redeem the Notes.

**_The Credit Facility permits us to dispose of our assets and business relating to our business division._**

The Credit Facility permits us to sell the assets relating to our business division or to contribute them to a
joint venture. In each such case, business division assets would no longer be held by an entity that is subject to
the covenants contained in the Credit Facility. As a result, we may undertake transactions related to these assets
(such as selling them or securing debt on them) which will not be subject to the limitations of the covenants, and
we would potentially lose access to all or a portion of the cash flows generated by these assets as well as the
value of these assets.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that
a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or

34


-----

withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets._**

Pursuant to the recommendation of the 2021 Green Bond Principles that issuers use external assurance to
confirm their alignment with the key features of the 2021 Green Bond Principles, Sustainalytics, a provider of
ESG research and analysis, has been engaged to provide an independent second-party opinion (the “Second**Party Opinion”) in relation to the alignment of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework with the 2021 Green**
Bond Principles and to provide views on the robustness and credibility of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
(which views are intended to inform investors in general, and not for a specific investor). Accordingly, on
August 5, 2022, Sustainalytics certified that the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework aligns with the 2021 Green
Bond Principles. The Second-Party Opinion is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this offering
memorandum.

There is currently no clearly defined definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus on,
what precise attributes are required for a particular company to be defined as “green”, “sustainable” or such other
equivalent label, and nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over
time. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects will meet all investor
expectations or requirements regarding “green”, “sustainable”, “social” or similar labels (including Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment). Further, no assurances
can be provided that allocations to projects with these specific characteristics will be made by us with respect to
an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Notes. There is no guarantee as to the environmental and/or social
impacts of the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects.

Neither the Issuer, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers nor their affiliates make
any representation as to: (i) the suitability of any opinion (including the Second-Party Opinion) or certification of
any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuer, Virgin Media or VMED O2 UK Holdco 4) or the Notes to
fulfill any environmental and sustainability criteria; (ii) whether the Notes will meet investor criteria and
expectations with regard to environmental impact and sustainability performance; (iii) whether an amount equal
to the net proceeds of the Finco Loan € will be used to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2
Eligible Green Projects; or (iv) the characteristics of the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, including their
environmental and sustainability criteria. The Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion is not a recommendation by the Issuer, Virgin Media, VMED O2
UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as at the
date of the Second Party Opinion. Moreover, the Second Party Opinion provider and providers of similar
opinions and certifications are not currently subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any
such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, Virgin Media,
VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, any second party opinion providers, or any
other person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Holders of the Notes have no recourse against the Issuer, Virgin
Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, or the provider of any such opinion or
certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification, including as to suitability or reliability for any
purpose, which is only current as at the date it was initially issued.

In the event that the Notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated “green”, “environmental”,
“sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange or securities market (whether or not
regulated), no representation or assurance is given by the Issuer, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the
Initial Purchasers or any other person that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any
present or future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which
such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or
regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with
regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects or uses, the subject of
or related to, any VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects. Furthermore, it should be noted that the criteria for any such
listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or securities market to another. No
representation or assurance can be given or made by the Issuer, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial
Purchasers or any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of any such
Notes or, if obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of the Notes.

Each potential investor in the Notes must make its own determination with respect to the relevance of the
information contained in this offering memorandum regarding the use of proceeds, and its purchase of Notes
should be based upon such investigation as it deems necessary. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion or any
failure by VMED O2 UK Holdings to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes
to VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects or to meet or continue to meet the investment requirements of certain
environmentally focused investors with respect to the Notes may affect the value of the Notes and/or may have
consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in “green” assets.

The Issuer, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates make no
assurances as to (i) whether the Notes offered hereby will meet investor criteria and expectations regarding
environmental impact and sustainability performance for any investors, (ii) whether the net proceeds will be used
for the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, (iii) the characteristics of the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects,
including their environmental and sustainability criteria or (iv) the suitability of the Second-Party Opinion or the
Notes to fulfill such environmental and sustainability criteria.

The Initial Purchasers have not undertaken, nor are responsible for, any assessment of the VMED O2
Eligible Green Projects, any verification of whether the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects meet the eligibility
criteria of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework or any monitoring of the use of proceeds.

**_Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the_**
**_offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects or to_**
**_satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings._**

Although we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance
and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, the Indenture will not include covenants
or agreements requiring the Issuer or VMED O2 UK Holdings to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds
from this offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible Green
Projects or to satisfy the reporting and other undertakings therewith. As a result, it will not be an event of default
under the Indenture if VMED O2 UK Holdings fails to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the
offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects or to
satisfy such reporting and other undertakings, and holders of the Notes will have no remedies under the Indenture
for any such failure. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects will be
capable of being implemented in or substantially in such manner and/or in accordance with any timing schedule
and that accordingly such proceeds will be totally or partially disbursed for such VMED O2 Eligible Green
Projects. Nor can there be any assurance that such VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects will be completed within
any specified period or at all or with the results or outcome as originally expected or anticipated by us.

We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you that the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects to which we
allocate amounts relating to the offering of the Notes will satisfy, or continue to satisfy, investor criteria and
expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance, nor can we or the Initial Purchasers
assure you that the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects criteria and other aspects of the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework will satisfy, or continue to satisfy, investor criteria or expectations for sustainable finance products.
In particular, no assurance is given that the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects will satisfy, whether in whole or
in part, any present or future investor expectations or requirements, voluntary taxonomies or standards regarding
any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether
by any present or future applicable laws or regulations, by its own bylaws or other governing rules or investment
portfolio mandates, ratings criteria, voluntary taxonomies or standards or other independent expectations (in
particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any VMED O2
Eligible Green Projects or uses, the subject of or related to, the relevant VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects).
Additionally, we may revise the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework from time to time, and the criteria used by
us to identify VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects may differ in the future. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to identify sufficient business activities qualifying as VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects to which
we could re-allocate amounts equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes if VMED O2 UK Holdings
no longer owns a previously-allocated VMED O2 Eligible Green Project or if a previously allocated VMED O2
Eligible Green Project no longer meets the applicable criteria.

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer within the United States or to U.S. persons and may be subject_**
**_to transfer restrictions under the laws of other jurisdictions._**

The Notes offered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale. The Notes are being offered in reliance upon an exemption from

36


-----

registration under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the Notes may be
transferred or resold only in a transaction registered under or exempt from, or not subject to, the U.S. Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. Please see “Transfer Restrictions”. It is the obligation of holders of the
Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to
a currency other than that of the Notes you purchase, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange-related
risks, including possible significant changes in the value of euro, relative to the currency by reference to which
you measure your investment returns because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro, against the currency by reference to which you measure your investment
returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result
in a loss to you when the return on such Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure
your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains
resulting from any investment in the Notes and you should consult with your own tax advisors regarding any
such tax consequences. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant Clearing Systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in exchange for a book-entry interest in the Notes, an
owner of a book-entry interest will not be considered an owner or holder of Notes. Instead, a nominee of the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, will be the sole holder of the Notes.

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (as defined herein) (including principal,
premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by us to the paying agent. The paying
agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee,
and Euroclear and Clearstream, will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures.

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from the Clearing Systems or, if applicable, from a participant therein. The Issuer cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested
actions on a timely basis.

The lack of physical certificates could also:

    - result in payment delays on your certificates because the Trustee will be sending distributions on the
certificates to the Clearing Systems instead of directly to you;

    - make it difficult for you to pledge your certificates if physical certificates are required by the party
demanding the pledge; and

    - hinder your ability to resell your certificates because some investors may be unwilling to buy
certificates that are not in physical form.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with its registered
office and principal place of business in England. It is anticipated that some or all of the directors and officers of
the Issuer will be non-residents of the United States and that all or a majority of the Issuer’s assets will be located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to enforce in the United States judgments of
U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

It is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if
proceedings were commenced in England predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See
“Enforceability of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original issue discount if its stated
redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by at least a de minimis amount. If a Note is treated as issued
with original issue discount, U.S. investors will be subject to tax on that original issue discount as it accrues, in
advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to that income (and in addition to stated interest). See
“Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_The Notes could be treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes, and in such case U.S. Holders may be subject to_**
**_adverse tax consequences._**

The Issuer expects the Notes to be treated as debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
however no assurances can be given that the Issuer’s position will not be successfully challenged by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. If successfully challenged by the IRS that the Notes are treated as equity, U.S. Holders
(as defined in “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be treated as holding equity in the
Issuer. If the Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders would
likely be subject to adverse tax consequences, including those under the passive foreign investment company
rules pursuant to which (i) all or a portion of any gain on a disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary
income rather than capital gain, (ii) a deferred interest charge would apply to such gain and on certain
distributions on the Notes and (iii) a U.S. Holder would be required to comply with certain reporting
requirements.

**_Employee benefit plan considerations may affect your ability to invest in the Notes._**

Each acquirer and each transferee of a Note or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and agreed at the time of its acquisition and throughout the period that it holds such Note or any
interest therein that (i) either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as such acquirer or
transferee holds such Note or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan
Investor (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”) or a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Laws (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan
_Considerations”), and no part of the assets used by it to acquire or hold any Note or any interest therein_
constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or any such governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, or (b) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note, or any interest therein, does not and will not constitute or
otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA (as defined under “Certain
_Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”) and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental,_
church or non U.S. plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws); and (ii) none of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates is or is undertaking to act as a fiduciary (within the
meaning of section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or, with respect to a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan, any definition of “fiduciary” under “Similar Laws”)) with respect to the acquirer or transferee in
connection with any purchase or holding of the Notes, or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates of any rights in connection with the Notes, and no
advice provided by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates constitutes
“investment advice” (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in connection
with the Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to the Notes. See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan
_Considerations” herein for a more detailed discussion of certain ERISA and related considerations with respect_
to an investment in the Notes.

**_The Volcker Rule may affect your ability to invest in the Notes._**

Section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, together with the rules, regulations
and published guidance promulgated thereunder (known as the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibits “banking
entities” from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in, sponsoring, or having
certain relationships with, a “covered fund”, subject to certain exclusions from the definition of “covered fund”
or exemptions from the Volcker Rule’s covered fund-related prohibitions. For purposes of the Volcker Rule, a
“banking entity” is defined to include: (i) any U.S. insured depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1813), subject to certain exclusions); (ii) any company that controls a
U.S. insured depository institution; (iii) any non-U.S. company that is treated as a bank holding company for
purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (i.e., a foreign bank that maintains a branch,
agency or commercial lending office in the U.S.); and (iv) any affiliate or subsidiary of any entity described in
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (and the rules,

38


-----

regulations and published guidance thereunder), other than a “covered fund” that is not itself a banking entity
under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii).

The definition of “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule includes, in part, any issuer that would be an
investment company under the 1940 Act but for the exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7)
thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on the exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be
considered a covered fund for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the
definition of “covered fund”. In the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” that are
subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership
interest” in the Issuer, unless such banking entity is able to rely on an applicable exemption under the Volcker
Rule.

“Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule as “any equity, partnership, or other
similar interest”. The Notes are not equity or partnership interests. The phrase “other similar interest” is further
defined under the Volcker Rule as an interest that:

(A) has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member
of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading
advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence
of an event of default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an
investment manager for “cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an
investment manager’s resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR
§248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2));

(B) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the
covered fund;

(C) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been
redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the
occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event);

(D) has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the
aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate
interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests);

(E) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to
the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund,
such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or
reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest;

(F) receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is
determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or

(G) any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above.

On the Issue Date, pursuant to and in accordance with the Indenture, the Trustee will be appointed to act as
trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the Security Trustee will be appointed to act as security trustee
for the creditors (including the holders of the Notes) that will benefit from the Collateral (the “CSA Secured
**Parties”). Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement,**
prior to the occurrence of a CSA Enforcement Event (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) (following the
occurrence of an Event of Default under (and as defined in the Indenture) which is continuing and the
acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture), the Issuer may continue to exercise its rights
under the Transactions Documents (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), including with respect to its
assets comprising the Collateral, and the provisions of the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents will
not otherwise afford any holder of the Notes with the right to: (i) take any corporate action or other steps or legal
proceedings for the winding-up, dissolution or reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator,
administrative receiver, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, examiner or similar officer of the Issuer or of its
revenues and assets; or (ii) take any steps for the purpose of obtaining payments of amounts payable to it under
the Notes, the Indenture or any Notes Security Document, or to take any steps to recover any debts whatsoever
owing to it by the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes”. These rights of the holders of the Notes to enforce the
rights and remedies granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and Notes Security
Documents are the types of rights that are excluded from the rights that are included in the definition of “other
similar interests”.

39


-----

The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to participate in the selection or
removal of any of the types of partners, members or managers of the Issuer described in Clause (A) above. The
Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of VMED O2 UK Holdings. The holders of the Notes have no rights to
participate in the selection or removal of the Issuer’s board of directors or management.

The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to receive a share of the income,
gains or profits of the Issuer as described in Clause (B) above, and have no rights to receive the underlying assets
of the Issuer after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to
exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event) as described in Clause
(C) above. The Issuer is a financing company which, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, will be subject
to the restrictions set out in the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents. The Notes will be subject to the
Limited Recourse Restrictions (as further described in the “Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum). The only assets of the Issuer available to meet claims of the holders of the Notes and the
other CSA Secured Parties are the assets comprising the Collateral, which (as described above) cannot be
enforced prior to a CSA Enforcement Event in accordance with the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

The holders of the Notes have no rights to receive any excess spread (the positive difference, if any,
between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of Issuer and the aggregate interest
paid to the holders of the Notes) as described in Clause (D) above.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue the Notes, each series of which will bear interest at a fixed rate per
annum as further described elsewhere in this offering memorandum. While the Issuer, as a financing company, is
wholly dependent on the payments it will receive in respect of the Finco Loan €, the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement and the applicable Related Agreements, and a failure by the Credit Facility Obligors (with respect to
the Finco Loan € and Finco Facility € Accession Agreement) or the Credit Facility Borrower, VMED O2 UK
Holdco 5 and/or VMIH (with respect to the Related Agreements) to provide such funding may, in practice,
negatively impact the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Indenture and Notes. However, subject to
the Limited Recourse Restrictions, there are no contractual terms of the Notes under the Indenture or the other
Note Security Documents which provide that the amounts payable by the Issuer (whether as principal or interest)
with respect to the Notes will be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the Issuer as
described in Clause (E) above. Furthermore, as each series of the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, the rate of
interest on the Notes is not determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the Issuer as
described in Clause (F) above. In addition, the Issuer expects that the holders of the Notes will not receive
income on a pass-through basis from the Issuer as described in Clause (F) above, as the Issuer expects that the
holders of the Notes will hold the Notes as debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Issuer is a financing company which will depend on_
_payments under the Finco Loan € to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes” and_
“Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Issuer will not be entitled to
make any modifications to the terms of the Notes which would have the effect of reducing the principal amount
of the Notes or reducing the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on the Notes, without
the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes”.

The Indenture, the Transaction Documents and the Notes Security Document Documents do not confer upon
the holders of the Notes any synthetic rights to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses
(A) through (F) above.

Before making an investment in the Notes, each potential investor in the Notes should consult with its own
counsel and make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether the Notes
constitute “ownership interests”, whether any exclusion or exemption under the Volcker Rule might be
applicable to an investment in the Notes by such investor, whether its investment in the Notes would be restricted
or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its investment, any
liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. See “Transfer Restrictions”. None of Virgin
Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, VMED O2 UK Holdings, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Trustee, nor
any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes
regarding the treatment of the Issuer or the Notes under the Volcker Rule or to the impact of the Volcker Rule on
such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may impact the price
and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market or restrict prospective investors’ ability to hold the Notes. Each
purchaser is responsible for analyzing its own regulatory position under the Volcker Rule and any similar measures.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes are expected to be £ million (equivalent) (after
deducting an estimated £ million (equivalent) of fees and expenses associated with the offering of the
Notes).

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with certain amounts received
under the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund the Finco Loan € to the Credit Facility
Borrower pursuant to the Credit Facility. We intend to use the gross proceeds of the Finco Loan € (i) to pay fees
and expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes, and (ii) in one or more transactions, towards the
refinancing of certain existing senior secured indebtedness of the Group, which may occur, by way of open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, repayments, prepayments, redemptions, or
otherwise, and to pay any related fees, premiums and expenses in connection therewith (the “Refinancing
**Transactions”). We expect that the Refinancing Transactions will be undertaken over a period of time and any**
such Refinancing Transactions will be on such terms and at such times as the Group may determine in its sole
discretion.

In accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework, VMED O2 UK Holdings intends to use an
amount equal to the net proceeds of the Finco Loan € to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VMED O2
Eligible Green Projects and to pay fees and expenses in relation thereto. Accordingly, on August 5, 2022,
Sustainalytics, a provider of ESG research and analysis, evaluated the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework and
certified that it aligns with the 2021 Green Bond Principles and provided views on the robustness and credibility
of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (which views are intended to inform investors in general, and not for a
specific investor). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not be a
_suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to_
_the Notes and the Structure—Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the_
_net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/ or existing VMED O2 Eligible_
_Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

**VMED O2 Green Bond Framework**

To support our sustainability strategy “Better Connections”, we have adopted the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework under which we can issue green bonds to finance or refinance our projects, enabling us to meet our
environmental objectives. The VMED O2 Green Bond Framework outlines the Joint Venture’s commitments
with respect to any green bonds that will be issued. The VMED O2 Green Bond Framework is aligned with the
2021 Green Bond Principles that recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the
development of the green bond market. The Second-Party Opinion and the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
are publicly available on our website (www.virginmediao2.co.uk). Please note that such information and
materials found on, or accessible through, our website are not part of this offering memorandum and are not
incorporated by reference herein.

The VMED O2 Green Bond Framework is presented through the following key pillars:

    - use of Proceeds;

    - process for Project Evaluation and Selection;

    - management of Proceeds;

    - reporting; and

    - external Review.

**_Use of proceeds_**

We will finance and/or refinance eligible green projects of the Joint Venture (“VMED O2 Eligible Green
**Projects”) that support our transition to a net zero carbon and zero waste future for the U.K. An amount equal to**
the net proceeds from the issuance of green bonds can be used to refinance existing projects and expenditures, in
accordance with the eligibility criteria outlined below, with a lookback period of up to 36 months from the issue
of the green bonds.

In addition, we intend to fully allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the issuance of green bonds
to the financing and refinancing of VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, as defined in the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework, no later than 36 months after the issue of the green bonds.

41


-----

VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects as defined in the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework are projects that
address Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Clean Transportation and Circular Economy Adapted Products,
Production Technologies and Processes.

**_Process for Project Evaluation and Selection_**

As part of the integration following the formation of the Joint Venture, we have established an
Environmental Steering Committee (the “Environmental SteerCo”). The Environmental SteerCo has assumed
the responsibilities of the Better for the Planet committee cited in the initial Green Bond Framework issued on
June 11, 2021, with regard to overseeing the selection of VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects in accordance with
the eligibility criteria described above.

The Environmental SteerCo is comprised of senior representatives from relevant operational teams and
supported by the Sustainability and Finance teams. It is chaired by our Head of Environment, Climate and Nature
and attended by our Chief Technology Officer, a member of our Leadership Team.

The Environmental SteerCo’s terms of reference set as its purpose to act as a sub-committee of our
Sustainability and Responsible Business committee in managing the environmental aspects of our business. The
Environmental SteerCo will manage all decisions regarding the delivery of our environmental strategy,
communications plans and project prioritization in addition to acting as the steering board for key environmental
projects. The Environmental SteerCo represents key areas of our business delivering and benefitting from these
environmental projects.

The Environmental Steerco’s meets on a bi-monthly basis and its responsibilities include:

1. supporting the development and delivery of our environmental strategy, including communication of
the environmental strategy to internal and external stakeholders;

2. our Environmental Management system;

3. key environmental projects and related Executive Objectives Key Results;

4. green bond financing.

With regard to the green bond financing, the Environmental SteerCo has delegated the review and approval
of proposed allocations of spend on VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects to the “Green Bond sub-group”. The
Green Bond sub-group is drawn from the Environmental SteerCo membership, with the Green Bond Registrar
and a Treasury representative also included as invited participants. The Green Bond sub-group meets at a
minimum bi-annually for:

1. the review and approval of proposed allocations of eligible spend, including deciding on the inclusion
of spend on new eligible projects;

2. the review and approval of the periodic Allocation and Impact Reporting;

3. monitoring of the project portfolio for outcomes outside of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework’s
eligibility criteria;

4. the annual monitoring of the continued eligibility of the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects as set out in
the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework; and

5. following circulation for review and comment to the Environmental SteerCo, the final review and
approval of any revisions to the Green Bond Framework.

The Green Bond sub-group notifies the Environmental SteerCo of decisions made and provides feedback on
its activities to the Environmental SteerCo at the latter’s regular bi-monthly meetings.

**_Management of Proceeds_**

An amount equal to the net proceeds of any green bond raised under the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
will be allocated by the Joint Venture to finance or refinance VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects, as per the
VMED O2 Green Bond Framework’s eligibility criteria and the project selection process outlined above.

Such allocation will be reflected in our internal records by the use of a Green Bond Register. The Green
Bond Register will be administered by the Green Bond Registrar, a member of our Finance team. Proposals for
the allocations of eligible spend will be subject to the review and approval of the Green Bond sub-group prior to
their inclusion in the Green Bond Register.

42


-----

Any portion of the net proceeds that has not been allocated to VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects will be
managed in accordance with our standard liquidity management practices, whereby funds may be invested in
bank accounts, money market deposits or institutional money market funds that meet high credit quality
standards.

If for any reason a project in the portfolio cease to be eligible, the proceeds initially allocated shall be
reallocated to another VMED O2 Eligible Green Project, based on the same process. Replacement of the projects
will be done on a best effort basis within a reasonable period of time.

**_Reporting_**

The Joint Venture will make available reports covering allocation of the net proceeds to the VMED O2
Eligible Green Projects and reports on the impact of the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects. The reporting will be
made available within one year from the issuance of any green bonds and will be updated annually as at a
calendar year-end reporting date until full allocation of the green bond. The reporting will be on an aggregate
basis, at the level of the project portfolio. It will include:

_Allocation reporting_

    - Total amount allocated to the VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects Portfolio, reported by project
category

    - Share of net proceeds used for financing vs. refinancing

    - Balance of unallocated proceeds (if any)

The Joint Venture intends to engage their external auditor to review the reporting of the allocation of
proceeds towards VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects.

_Determining the pound sterling equivalent of non-functional currency proceeds and eligible expenditure._

Our functional currency for financial reporting purposes is pound sterling. We have issued, and may in the
future issue, green bonds in currencies other than pound sterling. We may also incur eligible spend in currencies
other than pound sterling, which will be reflected in our accounting books and records at pound sterling
equivalent amounts. Where this occurs, we will follow its existing accounting policies with regard to foreign
currency translation in determining the pound sterling equivalent of such non-functional currency items when
determining the net proceeds of any Green Bond issue or the pound sterling equivalent amount of eligible spend
for allocation purposes.

_Impact reporting_

On a best effort basis, the Joint Venture intends to report on the environmental impacts achieved by funded
VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects. The impact reporting will include a description of VMED Eligible Green
Projects and impact metrics measured at the level of the overall business.

**_External Review_**

The Issuer has engaged an external verifier, Sustainalytics, to review the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework. On August 5, 2022, Sustainalytics provided an independent Second Party Opinion on the VMED O2
Green Bond Framework’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the 2021 Green Bond Principles.

On an annual basis, an external auditor will perform a limited assurance review of the allocation of proceeds
towards VMED O2 Eligible Green Projects as at the year end as provided in the annual allocation report. This
limited assurance review will also include review of the impact reporting metrics for the year.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERCREDITOR DEEDS**

The Credit Facility Borrower, Telefonica UK Limited and the Virgin Media Group have entered into (i) a
group intercreditor deed (the “Group Intercreditor Deed”) with, among others, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, as security trustee under the Credit Facility and as security trustee for the Existing VMED O2 Senior
Secured Notes, The Bank of Nova Scotia as facility agent under the Credit Facility and The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustees for the Existing
VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) a high yield intercreditor deed (the “High Yield Intercreditor Deed”)
with, among others, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as facility agent under the Credit Facility, BNY Mellon Corporate
Trustee Services Limited, as trustee for the Existing VMED O2 Senior Notes and Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch as security trustee.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will accede to each of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the High Yield
Intercreditor Deed, respectively, as a Senior Lender in its capacity as a Credit Facility Lender with respect to the
Finco Facility €.

Upon receipt of the required consents from Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility and the other
creditors under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the
High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2 Senior
Secured Notes and the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (which takes effect by way of amendment and
restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will establish the relative rights of the Credit Facility Lenders, the
holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors under other financing
arrangements of the Group.

Definitions of certain terms used in this “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds” may be found below under
the headings “—Group Intercreditor Deed—Certain Definitions”, “—High Yield Intercreditor Deed—Certain
_Definitions” and “—New Group Intercreditor Agreement—Certain Definitions”. The summaries set forth below_
do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual deeds, copies of which
will be made available by us upon request. See “Listing and General Information”. The form of the New Group
Intercreditor Agreement is attached as Annex C to this offering memorandum.

**Group Intercreditor Deed**

The Group Intercreditor Deed governs the relationship among the Senior Liabilities (as described below),
including the Credit Facility, the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes, secured hedge counterparties and
certain intra-group debtors and creditors.

**_Priorities_**

The Group Intercreditor Deed provides that the Senior Liabilities and the secured hedging liabilities rank
_pari passu without any priority among themselves but senior to certain intra-group liabilities._

**_Senior Liabilities_**

For purposes of the Group Intercreditor Deed, the “Senior Liabilities” include all of the present and future
obligations and liabilities (excluding hedging liabilities) of the Group to the Senior Finance Parties under or in
connection with the Senior Finance Documents, including any New Senior Liabilities, together with any related
additional liabilities owed to the Senior Finance Parties and together also with all costs, charges and expenses
incurred by each of the Senior Finance Parties in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of
its rights under the Senior Finance Documents.

VMIH may at any time designate liabilities under any credit facility or other financial accommodation as
“New Senior Liabilities” under the Group Intercreditor Deed (whether to refinance, replace or increase any
existing Senior Liabilities or to constitute any new financial accommodation), provided that the incurrence of
such liabilities complies with the terms of the Credit Facility (or, upon its discharge in full, the Designated
Refinancing Facilities Agreement). VMIH will designate the Finco Facility € as New Senior Liabilities on the
Issue Date upon which designation they will constitute Senior Liabilities for all purposes under the Group
Intercreditor Deed.

46


-----

**_Instructing Party_**

The Instructing Party which controls, among other things, voting and enforcement with respect to and under
the Group Intercreditor Deed is defined, for as long as any of the Senior Liabilities are outstanding, as:

(i) prior to an Enforcement Control Event, the Instructing Group (as defined in the Credit Facility or, upon
its repayment in full and cancellation of all undrawn commitments thereunder, the Designated
Refinancing Facilities Agreement); or

(ii) upon an Enforcement Control Event, the Senior Finance Parties representing a majority of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount and undrawn un-canceled commitments under the Senior
Finance Documents at the relevant date of determination.

For the definition of “Instructing Group” under the Credit Facility, see “Description of the Credit Facility
_and the Related Agreements—Credit Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—Instructing Group”._

**_Enforcement_**

The Group Intercreditor Deed sets forth the relative rights of, among other things, the Group’s creditors in
relation to the Senior Liabilities to enforce the security interests granted by the Group. The Issuer (as a Credit
Facility Lender), at all times has the right, subject to the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the relevant
finance documents, to, among other things:

    - demand payment of interest or principal;

    - declare prematurely due or accelerate any interest or principal;

    - perfect and preserve rights in any security interest;

    - institute legal proceedings under the terms of the Senior Finance Documents (other than the Security
Documents) for collection of amounts owing thereunder, to seek injunctive relief against any actual or
putative breaches of any Senior Finance Documents or for specific performance or similar remedies or
assert rights of an unsecured creditor, including arising under any insolvency event;

    - file any necessary or responsive pleadings in response to any person objecting or seeking disallowance
of their rights in the security; and

    - file claims or statements of interest with respect to the Senior Liabilities upon the occurrence of any
insolvency event.

Any of the following additional enforcement actions proposed to be taken by the Issuer would require the
consent of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative):

    - exercise or seek to exercise any right to crystallize any floating charge created pursuant to the Security
Documents;

    - exercise or seek to exercise any right to enforce any encumbrance created pursuant to the Security
Documents;

    - exercise or seek to exercise the remedy of foreclosure in respect of any asset subject to any
encumbrance created pursuant to the Security Documents;

    - petition for, initiate or support to take, or join with any person in commencing to take, any steps with a
view to any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, administration or dissolution proceedings or any
voluntary arrangements for the benefit of creditors or any similar proceedings involving an obligor;

    - contest or support any other person in contesting, the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of
all or any part of the security granted pursuant to the Security Documents or the validity or
enforceability of any of the Senior Liabilities or the secured hedging liabilities or of the priorities,
rights or duties established by the Group Intercreditor Deed;

    - contest, protest or object to any enforcement or foreclosure proceeding or action or any other rights and
remedies relating to the security granted pursuant to the Security Documents brought by the Credit
Facility Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders or object to the forbearance by the Credit Facility
Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders from bringing or pursuing any enforcement or foreclosure
proceeding or action or otherwise exercise any right of remedies relating to the security; or

47


-----

    - take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or
delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the security by the Credit Facility Security Trustee.

The secured hedge counterparties, holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and certain
intra-group creditors are also subject to certain limitations on taking enforcement action under the Group
Intercreditor Deed as well as certain limitations on receiving payments and other distributions in respect of the
secured hedging liabilities and intra-group liabilities.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The Credit Facility Security Trustee will act in relation to the security interests in accordance with the
instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative). Before giving any instructions to the
Credit Facility Security Trustee to enforce any security interests, the relevant agent or representative acting for
the Instructing Group is required to consult with the Credit Facility Security Trustee in good faith, with a view to
coordinating their actions, for a period of 45 days or such shorter period as the relevant agent may determine.
The relevant agent or representative is not required to so consult with the Credit Facility Security Trustee if:

    - the security interest has become enforceable as a result of (i) an insolvency event, (ii) a non-payment
event of default under the Credit Facility or any equivalent provisions under any other Senior Finance
Document, or (iii) any other party taking any enforcement action against an obligor; and

    - the relevant agent determines in good faith (and notifies the Security Trustee) that to enter into such
consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the security interest could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact in any material respect the ability to enforce any of the
security interests or the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security interests.

The Credit Facility Security Trustee will incur no liability to any Priority Creditor in exercising in good
faith any discretion with respect to the enforcement of security interests or if it acts on the advice of a reputable
independent investment bank. The Credit Facility Security Trustee and the Credit Facility Agent will be required
to use reasonable efforts to consult with any authorized representative or any steering committee or other
representative in respect of any series of Additional Senior Liabilities, which would include, prior to the any
Enforcement Control Event, the Issuer prior to taking any enforcement action and provide on a regular basis
relevant information on the status of any ongoing enforcement action.

**_Release of Collateral_**

If any assets are sold or otherwise disposed of (i) by (or on behalf of) the Credit Facility Security Trustee,
(ii) as a result of a sale by an administrator or liquidator, or (iii) by an obligor at the request of the Credit Facility
Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or
representative)), in each case, of the foregoing, either as a result of the taking of an enforcement action or a
disposal by an obligor after any enforcement action, the Credit Facility Security Trustee is authorized to release
those assets from the collateral and is authorized to execute, without any further authority by any Priority
Creditor,

    - any release of the collateral or any other claim over that asset and to issue any certificates of
non-crystallization of any floating charge that may, in the absolute discretion of the Credit Facility
Security Trustee, be considered necessary or desirable;

    - if the asset which is disposed of consists of all of the shares in the capital of an obligor or any holding
company or subsidiary of that obligor, any release of that obligor or holding company or subsidiary
from all liabilities it may have to any Priority Creditor or other obligor and a release of any security
interest granted by that obligor or holding company or subsidiary over any of its assets; and

    - if the asset which is disposed of consists of all of the shares in the capital of an obligor or any holding
company or subsidiary of that obligor and if the Credit Facility Security Trustee wishes to dispose of
any liabilities owed by that obligor, any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities on behalf
of the relevant Priority Creditors, obligors or agents (with the proceeds thereof being applied as if they
were the proceeds of enforcement of the collateral) provided that the Credit Facility Security Trustee
takes reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the
Credit Facility Security Trustee has no obligation to postpone any disposal in order to achieve a higher
price). No guarantees of any notes issued by the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer, the VMED O2

48


-----

Secured Notes Issuer, VMIH, any financing subsidiary, or any issuer of senior secured notes from time
to time under an indenture may be disposed of pursuant to this paragraph (although such guarantees
may be released pursuant to the preceding paragraph).

No liabilities of the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer, the VMED O2 Secured Notes Issuer, VMIH, any
financing subsidiary or any issuer of senior secured notes from time to time, in each case, in its capacity as a
borrower or issuer under any Senior Finance Documents, may be disposed of pursuant to the foregoing or
released pursuant to the foregoing. Any asset which is disposed of is released from the claims of all Priority
Creditors and the proceeds of such disposal will be applied in accordance with “—General Application of
_Proceeds” below._

**_Security Trustee Authorization_**

Subject to the terms of the Senior Finance Documents, at any time after an event of default has occurred and
is continuing under the Credit Facility or any of the other Senior Finance Documents, the Credit Facility Security
Trustee may take such steps as it deems necessary or advisable:

    - to perfect or enforce any of the security interests granted in its favor;

    - to effect any disposal or realization or enforcement of any of the liabilities of the obligors (including by
any acceleration thereof);

    - to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable in
relation to any of the liabilities of the obligors; or

    - otherwise to give effect to the intent of the Group Intercreditor Deed.

The Credit Facility Security Trustee may refrain from enforcing the security interests unless and until
instructed to do so by the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) and no Priority Creditor (or its
authorized representative) is permitted to contest or object to any enforcement action taken by the Credit Facility
Security Trustee on the instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative). No party is
permitted to take or receive any collateral or any proceeds of any collateral in connection with the exercise of any
right or remedy (including set off) with respect to the collateral other than the Credit Facility Security Trustee
acting on the instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) in accordance with the
terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed.

The Credit Facility Security Trustee has the exclusive right (and the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent
or representative) has the exclusive right to instruct the Credit Facility Security Trustee) to enforce rights,
exercise remedies (including set-off) and make determinations regarding the release, disposition, or restrictions
with respect to the security and in exercising such rights and remedies, the Credit Facility Security Trustee and
the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) may enforce the provisions of the Senior Finance
Documents and exercise the remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in
the exercise of their sole discretion.

Subject to “—Manner of Enforcement” below, if the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or
representative) instructs the Credit Facility Security Trustee to enforce the security, it may do so in such manner
as it deems fit, having regard solely to the interests of the Beneficiaries. Neither the Credit Facility Security
Trustee, the relevant agent acting for the Instructing Group nor any other Senior Finance Party is responsible to
any other creditor for any failure to enforce or to maximize the proceeds of any enforcement, and may cease any
such enforcement at any time.

**_Manner of Enforcement_**

If the Credit Facility Security Trustee does enforce any of the security interests it may do so in such manner
as it sees fit solely having regard to the interest of the Beneficiaries. The Credit Facility Security Trustee is not
responsible to any Beneficiary for any failure to enforce nor to maximize the proceeds of any enforcement, and
may cease any such enforcement at any time.

Neither the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) instructing the Credit Facility Security
Trustee, nor the Credit Facility Security Trustee itself, is required to take into account the sharing of proceeds
provision in the Group Intercreditor Deed when determining the manner of enforcement (and which security to
enforce) and, if it is determined to enforce any direct security over shares (other than shares in VMIH and/or

49


-----

VMIL), the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative, as the case may be) must in good faith
believe that doing so will result in more aggregate proceeds resulting from enforcement of security (disregarding
the sharing of proceeds provisions in the Group Intercreditor Deed) than would be realized solely from enforcing
direct security over shares in VMIH and/or VMIL alone.

**_Standstill Payments_**

Following an event of default under the Credit Facility or any other Senior Finance Document all payments
received by any Senior Finance Party to enter into any standstill agreement or other agreement to delay the taking
of any enforcement action is required to be shared among all the Senior Finance Parties pro rata based on the
aggregate outstanding principal amount and undrawn commitments with respect to the Senior Liabilities held by
such Senior Finance Party.

**_No New Encumbrances_**

For so long as any Senior Liabilities are outstanding, no obligor is permitted to grant or permit any
additional encumbrances, or take any action to perfect any additional encumbrances, on any asset or property to
secure any series of Senior Liabilities unless it has also granted an encumbrance on such asset or property to
secure all of the other series of Senior Liabilities to the extent legally possible and without undue burden on the
group (excluding limitations or exclusions in the collateral provided to any series pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series) and has taken all actions to perfect such encumbrances. To
the extent that the foregoing is not complied with, any amounts received by any Senior Finance Party in
contravention of the foregoing is required to be paid to the Credit Facility Security Trustee for the benefit of the
Priority Creditors for application pursuant to and in accordance with “—General Application of Proceeds”
below.

**_General Application of Proceeds_**

Subject to the rights of any preferential creditor and notwithstanding the terms of the Security Documents,
the net proceeds of enforcement of the collateral will be paid to the Credit Facility Security Trustee for the
benefit of the Priority Creditors pursuant to the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and will be applied by the
Credit Facility Security Trustee (or any receiver on its behalf) in the following order of priority, in each case,
until such amounts have been repaid and discharged in full:

FIRST, in or towards payment of a sum equivalent to the aggregate of any amounts payable to the Credit
Facility Security Trustee under the Senior Finance Documents, to the Credit Facility Security Trustee;

SECOND, in or towards payment of any fees, expenses, costs or commissions payable to any Senior
Finance Party under any Senior Finance Document;

THIRD, in or towards payment of a sum equivalent to the aggregate of the Senior Liabilities and the secured
hedging liabilities, to the Second Beneficiaries respectively, which sum will (if insufficient to discharge the same
in full) be paid to the Second Beneficiaries on a pro rata basis without any priority among themselves; and

FOURTH, in payment to the relevant obligor(s) or other person(s) entitled thereto.

To the extent that (i) the net proceeds of any enforcement of collateral and (ii) any other recoveries and/or
proceeds from any obligor (other than in the case of sub-paragraph (ii), such other recoveries and/or proceeds
from the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer and VMIH) are to be applied in accordance with the foregoing, any such
proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with the foregoing until all of the Senior Liabilities and the
secured hedging liabilities have been discharged in full.

To the extent that a security interest has not been granted in favor of any series of Senior Liabilities incurred
after October 30, 2009 or the Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series limit or exclude such security
interest from the collateral securing such series of Senior Liabilities, such series of Senior Liabilities will not
receive any net proceeds resulting from the enforcement of such security interests that was so limited or
excluded. The foregoing does not apply to the extent security has been granted over a particular asset under one
or more Senior Finance Documents which (A) security does not secure a particular series of Senior Liabilities or
(B) the Senior Finance Documents in respect of a particular series of Senior Liabilities limit or exclude such
security from the collateral securing such series of Senior Liabilities, but other security has been granted over
that asset which does secure such series of Senior Liabilities and is not so limited or excluded from the collateral
securing such series of Senior Liabilities.

**_Turnover_**

If any hedge counterparty, any creditor under intra-group debt or any obligor receives or recovers any
payment in contravention of the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed, it is required to hold such payment on
trust and pay over such amounts to the Credit Facility Security Trustee for application in accordance with the
order of application set forth above under “—General Application of Proceeds”.

**_Purchase Option_**

If an event of default has occurred under the Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities
Agreement and the Credit Facility Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders have begun any formal step to enforce
any guarantee under any Senior Finance Document and/or security under any Security Document, the Additional
Senior Finance Parties may, at the expense of such Additional Senior Finance Parties, purchase or procure the
purchase of all (but not part) of the rights and obligations of the Senior Lenders in connection with the Senior
Liabilities under the Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement upon 10 business days’
prior written notice.

If any Additional Senior Finance Parties in respect of more than one series of Additional Senior Liabilities
attempts to exercise this purchase option by procuring the service of the notice described above, such right will
be shared on a pro rata basis among the series of Additional Senior Liabilities that have served such notice.

Any such purchase shall take effect on the following terms:

    - payment in full in cash of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Credit
Facility (or any future Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement) as of the date that amount is to be
paid (including all accrued interest, fees and expenses, but not any prepayment fees, other than
EURIBOR break funding costs, if any);

    - payment in full in cash of the amount which each Senior Lender certifies to be necessary to compensate
it for any loss on account of funds borrowed, contracted for or utilized to fund any amount included in
the Senior Liabilities, resulting from the receipt of that payment otherwise than on the last day of an
interest period under the Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement, in relation
thereto;

    - after the transfer, no Senior Lender (in their capacity as such) will be under any actual or contingent
liability to any obligor or any other person under the Group Intercreditor Deed or any Senior Finance
Document for which it is not holding cash collateral in an amount and established on terms reasonably
satisfactory to it;

    - an indemnity is provided from each of the purchasing Additional Senior Finance Parties (or from
another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders) to the Senior Lenders in respect of all losses
which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender in consequence of any sum received or
recovered by any Senior Lender from any Senior Finance Party or obligor, or any other person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior
Lender for any reason whatsoever, provided that where it is demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Senior Lenders that those losses could not have been recovered in full by the relevant Senior
Lender under the Senior Finance Documents, had that transfer not been made, that indemnity shall not
extend to the shortfall; and

    - the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, the Senior Lenders, except that
each Senior Lender shall be deemed to have given certain limited warranties on the date of that
transfer.

**_Amendments_**

Save for certain technical amendments which may be made without reference to the Priority Creditors, the
agent or representative acting for the Instructing Party may, from time to time, agree with VMIH to amend the
Group Intercreditor Deed and any amendments so made will be binding on all the parties hereto, provided that
any amendment which would:

    - materially and adversely affect any rights of the Priority Creditors may not be made without the prior
written consent of the Instructing Party, provided that in the case of any such amendments which would
affect the rights of a series of Senior Liabilities in a way that is material and adverse relative to one or
more other series, the applicable consent of such affected series (as determined pursuant to the Senior
Finance Documents in respect of such series) will also be required;

51


-----

    - impose or vary any obligation on the Priority Creditors may not be made without the prior written
consent of the Instructing Party, provided that in the case of any such amendment which imposes or
varies the obligations of a series of Senior Liabilities in a way that is material and adverse relative to
one or more other series, the applicable consent of such affected series (as determined pursuant to the
Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series) will also be required;

    - have the effect of (i) changing the pari passu ranking of the secured hedging liabilities with the Senior
Liabilities or the pro rata basis of payment to the Second Beneficiaries described under “—General
_Application of Proceeds”, (ii) changing the amendments clause or (iii) the secured hedge counterparties_
ceasing to be Priority Creditors or the secured hedging liabilities ceasing to be secured obligations, in
each case, may not be made without the prior written consent of each secured hedge counterparty
adversely affected thereby; or

    - adversely affect any right, or impose or vary any obligation, of any party hereto other than a Priority
Creditor may not be made without the consent of that party.

Any amendment which relates to, or has the effect of, subordinating all or any portion of any series of
Senior Liabilities to the other Senior Liabilities will only require the consent of the Instructing Party and the
applicable consent of such series being subordinated (as determined pursuant to the Senior Finance Documents in
respect of such series).

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed currently governs the relationship of the various lenders under the Credit
Facility, holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes, certain related counterparties, VMIH, VMIL,
the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer and the VMED O2 Secured Notes Issuer. The High Yield Intercreditor Deed
contains express provisions for the subordination of certain guarantees and intercompany loans. We collectively
refer to these obligations as “subordinated obligations”.

**_Priorities_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that the following liabilities rank and should be paid and
discharged in the following order:

FIRST, the Senior Liabilities (as described below), pari passu without any priority among themselves (but
without prejudice to any alternative priorities in the Group Intercreditor Deed);

SECOND, the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities, pari passu with any other senior subordinated obligations
of any High Yield Guarantor and without any priority among themselves; and

THIRD, the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities.

**_Senior Liabilities and High Yield Guarantee Liabilities_**

For the purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed, “Senior Liabilities” include all present and future
obligations and liabilities of the obligors to the Senior Finance Parties under or in connection with the Senior
Finance Documents including any New Senior Liabilities together with any related additional liabilities owed to
the Senior Finance Parties and together also with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by each of the Senior
Finance Parties in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of its rights under the Senior
Finance Documents, which includes secured hedging liabilities. The obligations under the Credit Facility
(including the Finco Facility €), the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and the related secured hedging
liabilities will constitute Senior Liabilities for purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed.

For the purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed, “High Yield Guarantee Liabilities” include all
present and future obligations and liabilities of any High Yield Guarantor to any High Yield Creditors pursuant to
any High Yield Guarantee, together with any related additional liabilities owed to any High Yield Creditor
pursuant to any High Yield Guarantee in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of the
rights of such High Yield Creditors under the indenture and other related documentation with respect thereto.

**_Prohibited Action_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed prescribes certain restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on the
ability of any High Yield Guarantor in respect of the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or any Intra-group Debtor
in respect of the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities:

    - to make payments on (see “Payment Blockage” below);

    - to grant security for;

    - to defease; or

    - otherwise to provide financial support in relation to,

53


-----

the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities for so long as the Senior
Liabilities remain outstanding. In the event of a payment default with respect to the Senior Liabilities, service of
a payment blockage notice is not required to effect the restrictions described above.

**_Payment Blockage_**

A payment blockage notice may be served by the Instructing Group (as defined in the Credit Facility) or
representatives of Designated Indebtedness (if applicable) on, among others, the trustee of any High Yield Notes
during the continuance of a non-payment event of default with respect to the Senior Liabilities. While a payment
blockage is in effect, any High Yield Guarantor and any Intra-group Debtor will be prohibited from making any
payment with respect to the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities, as
applicable. In the event of a payment default with respect to the Senior Liabilities, service of a payment blockage
notice is not required to effect the restriction on making payments referred to under the “Prohibited Action”
section above.

However, a payment blockage notice is only permitted to be served on or before the date falling 45 days
after the date on which notice of such event of default has been received by the agent or representative of the
relevant series of Senior Liabilities. A payment blockage notice will remain outstanding, unless canceled, until
the earliest of:

    - 179 days after the date of such payment blockage notice;

    - the date on which the event of default under the Senior Liabilities is no longer continuing or is
remedied or waived;

    - cancellation of such payment blockage notice by the agent or representative of the relevant series of
Senior Liabilities which initially served such notice;

    - if any standstill period is in effect on the date of the service of such payment blockage notice, the date
on which such existing standstill period expired; or

    - the date on which the Senior Liabilities have been discharged in full.

Only one blockage notice is permitted to be served in respect of a particular event or circumstance, and only
one blockage notice is permitted to be served in any consecutive 360-day period relating to an event of default
under the Senior Liabilities which was existing at the time of such payment blockage notice, unless such event of
default has been remedied and is no longer continuing for at least 180 days prior to the service of the proposed
new payment blockage notice.

**_Standstill on Enforcement_**

The trustee under the indentures governing any of our High Yield Notes and the holders of such High Yield
Notes may bring an action to enforce the obligations of the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer thereunder and,
subject to the circumstances described below, the obligations of the relevant High Yield Guarantor under the
related High Yield Guarantee. Subject also to the circumstances described below, the VMED O2 Senior Notes
Issuer may also take action to enforce the obligations in respect of the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities.
Enforcement in respect of any High Yield Notes against the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer is not restricted by
the High Yield Intercreditor Deed. However, enforcement action may not be taken with respect to the
Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities, and the High Yield Guarantees will not become due, unless:

    - all of the Senior Liabilities have been discharged in full;

    - an insolvency event has occurred in relation to the relevant obligor;

    - any Senior Liabilities have been declared due and payable or due and payable on demand, or the
lenders thereunder have taken any action to enforce any security interest or lien granted in connection
with such obligations; or

    - a default has occurred with respect to the relevant High Yield Guarantees, the agents or representatives
of the Senior Liabilities have been notified of such default, a standstill period of 179 days has expired
and at the end of such period the default is continuing, unremedied or unwaived.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

In the event of an insolvency of any Intra-group Debtor, any High Yield Guarantor or any member of the
group which is a party to a secured hedging agreement, the High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that all High

54


-----

Yield Guarantee Liabilities and Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities will be subordinated to the prior payment in
full of all Senior Liabilities. In that event, the Credit Facility Security Trustee may make demands under, or
enforce, the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities and Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities and any amounts so
received in respect thereof shall be applied by the Credit Facility Security Trustee towards all Senior Liabilities
obligations outstanding until such obligations have been paid in full.

**_Turnover and Application of Proceeds_**

In the event that, in contravention of the subordination terms described above, or at a time when payments
are not permitted to be made:

    - the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer receives or recovers a payment or distribution, in cash or in-kind,
relating to any Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities, or

    - the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer, the trustee under the indentures governing any High Yield Notes or
any holder thereof receives or recovers a payment under any High Yield Guarantee,

such person will turn over such amount to the Credit Facility Security Trustee for application towards
payment of the Senior Liabilities until the obligations under the Senior Liabilities are paid in full as described
below under “—Priority of Payments”.

**_Release of the High Yield Guarantees_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides for the automatic and unconditional release and discharge of
High Yield Guarantees concurrently with any sales of all of the shares of any High Yield Guarantor or any of its
direct or indirect holding companies or of all or substantially all of the assets of a High Yield Guarantor by the
Credit Facility Security Trustee or an administrator appointed under the U.K. Insolvency Act of 1986. In order
for the release to be effective:

    - the proceeds of such sale must be in cash, or substantially in cash, and must be applied as described
below under “—Priority of Payments;”

    - the relevant High Yield Guarantor must be released from its obligations in respect of any other
indebtedness of any member of the restricted group, except for the Senior Liabilities and claims by the
trustee pursuant to the terms of any indenture governing the relevant High Yield Notes; and

    - the sale must be made pursuant to either a public auction or a competitive bid process to obtain the best
price reasonably obtainable given the then current condition (financial or otherwise), earnings,
business, assets and prospects of the relevant High Yield Guarantor and its subsidiaries, the Credit
Facility Security Trustee or administrator having consulted with an internationally recognized
investment bank, including without limitation and to the extent appropriate a Senior Lender (as defined
in the High Yield Intercreditor Deed) or a relationship bank of the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer or its
subsidiaries, or an internationally recognized accounting firm regarding the appropriate procedures for
obtaining the best price for the shares or assets, considered the recommendations of that investment
bank or accounting firm and used its reasonable efforts to cause the procedures recommended by that
investment bank or accounting firm to be implemented in all material respects in relation to the sale
and to permit holders of the relevant High Yield Notes to participate in the sale process as bidders.

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the Credit
Facility Security Trustee, the procedures referred to above are not implemented by the relevant court or other
authority or any other third party required to act in connection with such sale, the Credit Facility Security Trustee
will not be under any further obligation to cause such procedures to be implemented by such authority.

**_Priority of Payments_**

The postponement, subordination, blockage and prevention of payment of the High Yield Guarantees is not
intended to and will not impair the obligation of the High Yield Guarantors to pay the holders of the High Yield
Notes all amounts due and payable under such guarantees as and when they become due and payable in
accordance with the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed. The liabilities owed to the creditors of any High
Yield Guarantor will be paid and discharged in the following order:

FIRST, towards any liabilities owed to the trustee under the indentures of the High Yield Notes in respect of
any costs, charges or expenses incurred by or payable to it in its capacity as trustee under such indentures pari
_passu with the Credit Facility Security Trustee in respect of any costs, charges or expenses incurred by or_
payable to it in its capacity as Credit Facility Security Trustee;

55


-----

SECOND, towards any fees, costs, commissions or expenses payable to any Senior Finance Parties in
relation to Senior Liabilities;

THIRD, towards the discharge of any Senior Liabilities pari passu without any priority among themselves;

FOURTH, towards any liabilities owed to the holders of any of the High Yield Notes in respect of the
related High Yield Guarantee; and

FIFTH, towards payment of any Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities owed to the VMED O2 Senior Notes
Issuer by any Intra-group Debtor.

Any additional amounts remaining after discharge of the above listed liabilities will be paid to the relevant
obligor or any other person or persons entitled thereto.

errors or resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case of a minor technical or administrative nature or as
otherwise prescribed by the relevant Debt Documents.

Each Agent will, to the extent consented to by the requisite percentage of Creditors it represents or it is
otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is a party, act on such instructions in accordance
therewith unless to the extent any amendments so consented to or authorized relate to any provision affecting the
rights and obligations of that Agent in its capacity as such.

Where the Security Agent’s consent is required for any amendment or waiver it will act on the instructions
of the applicable Instructing Group, provided that in all cases such consent of the Security Agent shall be deemed

the Company.

unless the provisions of any Debt Document expressly provide otherwise:

(a) the Security Agent may, and if the Company and/or the relevant Security Agent Consents, amend the
terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant Consents under, any of the Security Documents
which shall be binding on each party to the New Group Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) the prior consent of the Primary Creditors is required to authorize any amendment or waiver of, or
Consent under, any Security Document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the
charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed.

Consent may impose new or additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party (other than

-----

in the case of a Primary Creditor, in a way which affects, or would affect, Primary Creditors of that party’s class
generally or in the case of a Debtor, to the extent Consented to by the Company under the New Group
Intercreditor Agreement), then the Consent of that party is required.

Subject to the paragraph immediately below, an amendment, waiver or Consent which relates to the rights
or obligations of an Agent, an Arranger, the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of the Security Agent to act in its discretion under the New Group Intercreditor Agreement) may not
be effected without the Consent of that Agent or, as the case may be, that Arranger or the Security Agent.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply to any release of security, claim or
liabilities or to any Consent which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set
out in the caption “Proceeds of Disposals” above. The two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply to an
Arranger only to the extent that Arranger Liabilities are then owed to that Arranger.

Agreement, or request to participate in any other vote, or to approve any other action under the New Group

Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, any Senior Secured Creditor, Second Lien Creditor, High Yield Creditor
or Unsecured Creditor fails to (i) respond within 10 Business Days (or within such other period as the relevant
Agent and the Company specify) or (ii) provide details of its Senior Secured Credit Participation, Second Lien
Credit Participation, High Yield Credit Participation or Unsecured Credit Participation to the Security Agent
within the timescale specified by the Security Agent, then:

(A) in the case of paragraph (a) above, that Senior Secured Credit Participation, Second Lien Credit
Participation, High Yield Credit Participation or Unsecured Credit Participation shall be deemed to be
zero and its status as a Second Lien Creditor, Senior Secured Creditor, High Yield Creditor or
Unsecured Creditor shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the relevant participations when
ascertaining whether any relevant percentage has been obtained for such Consent, approval or vote; and

(B) in the case of paragraph (b) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been
given.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the New Group Intercreditor Agreement or the Supplemental Deed, the
New Group Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary. However, such
override, as between any Creditor, any Debtor or any member of the Group or Security Grantor, will not cure,
postpone, waive or negate any breach, default or event of default under any Debt Document as provided in the
relevant Debt Document.

**_Governing law_**

The New Group Intercreditor Agreement is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with English
law.

interest being credited to the relevant account) for later application from time to time of those monies in the
Security Trustee’s discretion.

**_Turnover of Proceeds_**

The Collateral Sharing Agreement provides that, subject to certain provisions, if any Senior Secured
Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of Security, otherwise than in accordance with the
“Application of Proceeds” section described above, subject to certain exceptions, such Senior Secured Creditor
must promptly notify the Security Trustee and hold an amount (which shall not be in excess of the amount that
the Security Trustee reasonably considers might become owing at any time in the future) of that receipt or
recovery on trust for the Security Trustee and promptly pay that amount to the Security Trustee for application in
accordance with the “Application of Proceeds” section described above. The Debtor is under a similar obligation
to turn over any amounts received or recovered under any Finco Loan Agreement, following the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Liabilities or any enforcement of the Security, or at any time under the Group Intercreditor
Deed to the Security Trustee.

**_Amendments and Waivers—Collateral Sharing Agreement_**

Other than technical amendments or waivers made to or in relation to the Collateral Sharing Agreement:
(i) to correct any manifest error or typographical error; (ii) to resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or to effect
changes of a minor, technical, operational or administrative nature, or, (iii) for the purposes of addressing
technical issues arising under local law and in connection with the Security, which in each case may be agreed in
writing between the Security Trustee and the Debtor, the Collateral Sharing Agreement may, subject to certain
exceptions, only be amended or waived with the written agreement of the Note Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative acting in accordance with the required consent of each of the applicable Senior Secured Creditors
under the applicable Debt Documents.

To the extent an amendment, waiver or consent affects only one tranche of Debt and such amendment,
waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the Senior
Secured Creditors of the other tranches of debt, only written agreement from the representative of that tranche of
Senior Secured Liabilities is required in each case, acting in accordance with the required consent of the
applicable Senior Secured Creditors under the applicable Debt Documents.

**_Amendments and Waivers—Shared Security Documents_**

Any provision of a Shared Security Document may be amended or waived by the written agreement of the
Debtor and the Security Trustee (acting in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Sharing Agreement
and the relevant Shared Security Documents).

**_Additional Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Debtor may borrow additional loans and/or issue new note debt at any time without the prior consent of
any other Senior Secured Creditor, provided that, in each case, the incurrence of such Note Liabilities and Pari
Passu Debt Liabilities is permitted or not prohibited under the Debt Documents existing at the time of such issue,
and (subject to certain accession requirements), once incurred, any such new Note Liabilities and new Pari Passu
Debt Liabilities shall be treated as Senior Secured Liabilities for the purposes of the Collateral Sharing
Agreement.

Where the Finco Lender receives a Group Intercreditor Agreement Voting Request or otherwise becomes
entitled to exercise a Group Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such
right in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group provided that (other than in the case of a Group
Intercreditor Agreement Voting Request or a Group Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right relating to directions
or instructions to the security trustee under the Group Intercreditor Agreement in relation to any enforcement
action under the Group Debt Documents (including the enforcement of any Security (as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Deed))) to the extent a corresponding consent, amendment, release, waiver, direction, instruction or
other vote is not required to be submitted to the relevant Senior Secured Creditors pursuant to the terms of any
Debt Documents applicable to a specific tranche of Senior Secured Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities of
such tranche shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of calculating the Instructing Group.

Lender, to the following amendment to the definition of Encumbrance provided in the Group Intercreditor
Agreement as follows:

applied, set-off or made subject to a combination of accounts so as to effect payment of sums owed or
payable to any person; or

arrangements) having a similar effect.”

entitled to exercise a HYD Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such

consent, amendment, release, waiver, direction, instruction or other vote is not required to be submitted to the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors pursuant to the terms of any Debt Documents applicable to a specific tranche
of Senior Secured Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities of such tranche shall be deemed to be zero for the
purposes of calculating the Instructing Group.

**_Senior Facilities Agreement_**

Where the Finco Lender receives a Senior Facilities Agreement Voting Request or otherwise becomes
entitled to exercise a Senior Facilities Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such
right in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, any relevant Finco Loan Agreement and
any relevant Debt Documents.

**_Equalization_**

If, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which certain
specified enforcement action is taken and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the
proportions which their respective exposures at that date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior
Secured Creditors at such date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject to certain terms) will make such payments
among themselves as the Security Trustee shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that
(after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

accordance with ESG margin ratchet).

(f) The amounts outstanding under Facilities S through to W are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial
Statements, incorporated by reference herein.

(g) Excludes £37.0 million of borrowings pursuant to excess cash facilities under the Credit Facility. These
borrowings are owed to certain non-consolidated special purpose financing entities that have issued notes to
finance the purchase of receivables due from certain of our subsidiaries to certain other third parties for
amounts that we and our subsidiaries have vendor financed. To the extent the proceeds from these notes
exceed the amount of vendor financed receivables available to be purchased, the excess proceeds are used to
fund these excess cash facilities under our senior credit facilities.

**_Interest Rates_**

Under the Credit Facility, the rate of interest for each interest period in respect of each Facility under the
Credit Facility is the percentage rate per annum equal to the aggregate of an applicable margin and Term SOFR,
EURIBOR or SONIA, as applicable. Interest on each of the facilities accrues daily from and including the first
day of an interest period and is payable on the last day of each interest period (unless the interest period is longer
than six months, in which case interest is payable on the last day of each six-month period) and is calculated on
the basis of a 365-day year (in the case of amounts denominated in sterling) or 360-day year (in the case of
amounts denominated in any other currency and with respect to Facility S).

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Credit Facility requires (the “Credit Facility 80% Security Test”) that members of the Bank Group
which generate not less than 80% of the EBITDA of the Bank Group (excluding any EBITDA attributable to any
joint venture) in any financial year guarantee the payment of all sums payable under the Credit Facility and
related finance documentation and such members are required to grant first-ranking security over all or
substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable under the Credit Facility and related
finance documentation; provided, that the EBITDA of any member of the Bank Group that is not required to (or
cannot) become a Guarantor and grant security (or procure the granting of Security) due to the agreed security
principles shall be disregarded for this calculation; provided, further, that on and after the Asset Security Release
Date, the security shall be limited to (i) share pledges of all of the capital stock of the Borrowers and the Obligors
thereunder and (ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors in relation to certain intercompany loans (the
security securing the Credit Facility from time to time, the “Credit Facility Collateral”).

**_Prepayment_**

The Credit Facility contains detailed provisions in relation to voluntary and mandatory prepayment. Such
prepayments are subject to certain conditions and exceptions, and the Credit Facility also contains detailed
provisions regarding the order in which such prepayment proceeds are applied.

In addition to scheduled repayments of principal and interest, the Credit Facility must be prepaid (each
tranche in such proportion as described in the Credit Facility) on the occurrence of any of the following events:
(i) a Change of Control as defined therein followed by a request for repayment from the Facility Agent acting on
the instructions of the Instructing Group by not less than 30 Business Days’ notice; (ii) if it becomes illegal for a
Lender to perform any of its obligations relating to the Credit Facility (in which case, that Lender must be
prepaid); or (iii) certain Permitted Disposals as defined therein (and subject to certain conditions) with the net
proceeds thereof. Any mandatory prepayment is to be applied firstly against the term loans, secondly against the
revolving credit facilities (in the order of revolving loans followed by documentary credit outstandings) and
thirdly against repayment of any ancillary facility outstandings.

Further, the indebtedness under the Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid on giving at least three
Business Days’ prior written notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed between VMIH and the Facility
Agent). A term loan can be voluntarily prepaid in a minimum amount as is agreed by the VMIH and the relevant
Lender. A revolving facility loan can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part but, if in part, in a minimum
amount of £1,000,000 and an integral multiple of £500,000 together with accrued interest on the amount repaid
without premium or penalty but subject to break funding costs.

-----

**_Undertakings_**

The Credit Facility contains certain undertakings that, subject to certain customary and other agreed
exceptions, limit the ability of each Obligor and, in certain cases, each member of the Bank Group, to, among
other things:

    - incur, create or otherwise permit to be outstanding any Financial Indebtedness;

    - reduce its capital or purchase or redeem any class of its shares or any other ownership interest in it;

    - create or permit to subsist any Security Interest on or over the whole or any part of its present or future
assets, rights or revenues to secure or prefer any present or future Financial Indebtedness of any
member of the Bank Group or any other person;

    - dispose of all or any part of its assets;

    - make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another company or person;

    - grant or make any loans, any credit or any guarantees or enter into any transaction having the effect of
lending money to any person;

    - amend its constitutional documents in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Obligors (taken as a whole) to perform their payment obligations
under any of the Relevant Finance Documents;

    - declare, make or pay any dividend on or make any distribution on account of any class of its share
capital or capital stock or other securities to a Restricted Person;

    - make any payment of principal or interest on any loans to a Restricted Person; or

In addition, the Credit Facility also requires each Obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings subject
to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions.

Credit Facility previously and there are currently four Additional
Facilities outstanding. For further details, please refer to “—Credit
_Facility” above._

Any person may become a Lender under the Credit Facility by delivering
to the Facility Agent an additional facility accession deed (an “Additional
Facility Accession Deed”), which must be duly executed by that person
and the Facility Agent. That Lender will grant to the relevant.

Borrower a term loan or revolving loan facility (which may include any
Ancillary Facility or Documentary Credit) (the “Additional Facility”) in
the amount specified in the Additional Facility Accession Deed in
Sterling, euros or U.S. dollars. Upon the relevant person becoming a
Lender, the total commitments under the Credit Facility shall be increased
by the amount in the Additional Facility Accession Deed.

The aggregate principal amount of the proposed Additional Facility shall
not exceed the aggregate of the sum of:

(i) an unlimited amount, provided that the ratio of Senior Net Debt to
Annualized EBITDA is equal to or less than 4.50:1 or, in the case of
an Additional Facility proposed to be used for Acquisition Debt, the
ratio of Senior Net Debt to Annualized EBITDA would not be
greater than it was immediately prior to the relevant acquisition or
such other transaction;

(ii) if the proceeds of the Additional Facility are being used to refinance
existing indebtedness that ranks pari passu or senior in right of
security to the Facilities, an amount equal to the accrued interest,
premiums and other amounts owing or paid relating to such existing
indebtedness together with related fees and expenses;

relevant prepayment or cancellation is not funded or effected with
any long-term Financial Indebtedness (including Financial
Indebtedness in the form of a bridge or other interim credit facility
intended to be refinanced with long-term Financial Indebtedness);
and

(iv) any amount of Financial Indebtedness that does not exceed the
greater of £330,000,000 (or its equivalent) and 5.00% of Total Assets
at any time outstanding,

provided, that (w) any Additional Facility may be incurred under any of
the above paragraphs as selected by VMIH in its sole discretion,
(x) VMIH may elect to incur Additional Facilities under paragraph
(i) prior to using amounts available under paragraphs (iii) and (iv), (y)
amounts incurred pursuant to paragraph (iv) substantially concurrently

Indebtedness for the purposes of calculating Senior Net Debt and
(z) VMIH shall have the ability to classify such amounts of Financial

81


-----

Indebtedness on the date of their incurrence and shall only be required to
include the amount and type of such Financial Indebtedness in one of such
sub-paragraphs above and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence
to divide and classify an item of such Financial Indebtedness in more than
one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in such-paragraphs,
and, from time to time, may reclassify all or a portion of such Financial
Indebtedness, in any manner, (the “Additional **Facilities** **Cap”).**

There shall be no limit on the aggregate principal amount of any proposed
Additional Facility (a “Refinancing Additional Facility”) established in
exchange for, or to extend, renew, replace, repurchase, retire or refinance,
in whole, or in part, existing Utilisations or Commitments (the
“Refinanced Debt”), provided that if the obligations under such
Refinancing Additional Facility do not rank equal to or `junior to such
existing Utilisations and Commitments the principal amount of such
Refinancing Additional Facility shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Additional Facilities Cap (or its equivalent in other currencies).

A Refinancing Additional Facility may only be established if the
following conditions are met:

(i) it provides for Additional Facility Commitments which are in an
aggregate principal amount that is not less than £1,000,000 or
$1,000,000 in the case of any revolving loan facility and £15,000,000
or $15,000,000 in the case of any Term Facility, provided that such
amount may be less if equal to (x) in the case of Refinanced Debt
that is in the form of a Utilisation, the entire outstanding principal
amount of that Refinanced Debt or (y) in the case of Refinanced
Debt that is in the form of a Commitment, the entire commitment
amount of that Refinanced Debt;

(ii) in the case of Refinancing Additional Facilities which are Term
Facilities (a) it does not have a greater principal amount than the
principal amount of the Refinanced Debt plus accrued interest, fees,
premiums (if any) and penalties thereon and fees, expenses, OID and
upfront fees associated with the refinancing of such Refinanced Debt,
(b) it ranks pari passu or junior in right of payment with any
Additional Facility Commitments which are senior in right of payment
and shall rank pari passu or junior in right of Security with the
Additional Facility Commitments which are secured on a first ranking
basis in accordance with the terms of an intercreditor agreement or
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Facility
Agent, and (c) to the extent applicable, it is subject to the Group
Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement; and

and shall rank pari passu in right of security with the Additional
Facility Commitments which are secured on a first ranking basis,

Commitments than the principal amount of the Refinanced Debt and
accrued interest, fees, premiums (if any) and penalties thereon and
fees, expenses, OID and upfront fees associated with the refinancing
of the Refinanced Debt, and (c) it is subject to the Group
Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement.

9. **Purpose** See “—Accession Agreements to the Credit Facility” above.

10. Final Maturity Date See “—Accession Agreements to the Credit Facility” above.

11. Interest Under the Credit Facility, the rate of interest for each Advance (for an
interest period (i) for the VMED O2 Revolving Credit Facility between 1
day to 30 days or 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or such other period of up to 12

82


-----

months as the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing
Group in relation to that revolving facility) may agree with VMIH (ii) for
a term facility 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or such longer period of up to 12
months as all the Lenders holding Commitments under that Facility may
agree, provided further that the first interest period may be any other
period of 6 months or less as agreed by the Borrower and the Facility
Agent) is expressed to be the rate per annum determined by the Facility
Agent to be the aggregate of:

(a) the applicable margin; and

(b) EURIBOR in the case of an Advance denominated in euros or
SONIA in the case of an Advance denominated in any other
currency;
The interest rate for each of the VMED O2 Credit Facilities is as set forth
under “—Accession Agreements to the Credit Facility” above.
Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period. Default interest
for unpaid amounts shall be 1% above the standard margin level.

12. EURIBOR/Term SOFR/ In relation to Facility L, Facility M, Facility N, Facility O, Facility Q,
**SONIA** Facility R, Facility Y and Facility Z the respective EURIBOR/Term
SOFR/SONIA (plus credit adjustment spread) floor shall be zero.

13. Repayment Each of the VMED O2 Credit Facilities is repayable in full on its
respective maturity date set forth under “—Accession Agreements to the
_Credit Facility” above._

14. Mandatory Prepayment Mandatory prepayment and cancellation of an Advance is required in the
circumstances set out in greater detail in the Credit Facility, including in
the circumstances described below.

(a) If at any time it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a
Lender to perform any of its obligations then that Lender shall
promptly notify the Facility Agent. Upon the Facility Agent
notifying VMIH of the same: (i) the Commitments of that Lender
shall immediately be reduced to zero and canceled or, if required by
VMIH, transferred to another bank or institution willing to accept
that transfer; and (ii) on such date as the Facility Agent shall specify
(being no earlier than the last day permitted by law), VMIH will
procure that each Borrower repays that Lender’s participations in the
relevant Utilisations or, if required by VMIH, that Lender’s
participations are transferred to another bank or institution willing to
accept that transfer.

(b) If required by the Instructing Group, the Facility Agent shall cancel
each Facility and declare all outstanding Advances immediately due
and payable if (i) the Controlling Company ceases to be the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting
power of VMIH or, after a Permitted Affiliate Group Designation
Date, a Permitted Affiliate Parent and ceases to by virtue of the
articles of association or other documents, directly or indirectly, direct
or cause the direction of management and policies of VMIH or, after
a Permitted Affiliate Group Designation Date, a Permitted Affiliate
Parent; (ii) the disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
VMIH, a Permitted Affiliate Parent (after any Permitted Affiliate
Group Designation Date) and the Restricted Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole) other than as a result of the transfer of receivables to any
Asset Securitisation Subsidiary in connection with any asset
securitisation program; or (iii) at any time after a Permitted Affiliate
Group Designation Date, any Permitted Affiliate Holdco ceases to be
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 100% of the total
voting power of the voting stock of any Permitted Affiliate Parent.

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the event listed at (b)(i)
above upon the consummation of the Post-Closing Reorganisation or a
Spin-Off.

83


-----

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the event listed (b)(i) and
(b)(iii) above upon the liquidation on a solvent basis of a Permitted
Affiliate Holdco provided that:

(1) 100 per cent. of the shares in the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent
continue to be secured in favor of the Finance Parties on a first
ranking basis without any material adverse effect on the interests of
the Finance Parties;

(2) the successor Permitted Affiliate Holdco is not organized in a
jurisdiction which would result in a materially adverse effect on the
ability of the Finance Parties to enforce the Security over the shares
in the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent; and

(3) the successor Permitted Affiliate Holdco is the sole Shareholder of
the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent.

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the events listed at (b)(i)
and (b)(iii) upon the sale of 100 per cent. of the shares in a Permitted
Affiliate Parent by a Permitted Affiliate Holdco provided that such sale
falls within one or more of the paragraphs of the definition of Permitted
Disposal.

(c) Upon the receipt of proceeds from certain Permitted Disposals,
VMIH shall procure that an amount of the Facilities is prepaid which
is the lesser of (i) the amount of the Net Proceeds of such a disposal
and (ii) an amount so as to ensure that Financial Ratio (as defined
below) for the most recent Ratio Period ending prior to the receipt of
such proceeds would not be breached if the Financial Ratio was
tested for that most recent Ratio Period taking into account (on a pro
_forma basis) the amount of such prepayment (but ignoring such Net_
Proceeds).

No prepayment is required where:

(1) the amount of such prepayment would be less than the greater of
£200,000,000 and 2% of Total Assets;

(2) in connection with any Permitted Disposal where an amount equal to
the amount of such prepayment is reinvested in assets (including,
permitted acquisitions, permitted capital expenditure, operational
expenditure and permitted joint ventures) provided further that any
amount that has not been contracted to be so reinvested within 12
months and reinvested within 18 months (the “Reinvestment End
**Date”) shall be applied in prepayment, provided further that there**
shall be no requirement to make a prepayment if the Financial Ratio
was not required to be tested for the most recent Ratio Period ending
prior to the Reinvestment End Date.

Any prepayment of Utilisations from disposal proceeds shall be applied
first against the term loan facilities in such order as at the discretion of the
relevant Borrower, second against any revolving facilities on a pro rata
basis (in the order of revolving loan facilities followed by documentary
credits) and thirdly against any ancillary facilities.

15. Voluntary Prepayment Voluntary prepayment of any term loan or revolving facility loan by a
Borrower is permitted at any time on not less than three Business Days’
prior written notice, or such shorter period as may be agreed between
VMIH and the Facility Agent (such notice to be irrevocable).

A term loan can be voluntarily prepaid in a minimum amount as is agreed
by the VMIH and the relevant Lender.

A revolving facility loan can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part
but, if in part, in a minimum amount of £1,000,000 and an integral
multiple of £500,000 together with accrued interest on the amount repaid
without premium or penalty but subject to the payment of any Break
Costs (if applicable).

84


-----

16. Cancellation Any unutilized amount of the Total Commitments may be canceled by
VMIH, in whole or in part, at any time on not less than three Business
Days’ prior notice, or such shorter period as may be agreed between
VMIH and the Facility Agent (such notice to be irrevocable).

Partial cancellation must be in a minimum amount of £5,000,000 and an
integral multiple of £1,000,000. No premium or penalty shall apply in
respect of any repayment save for break costs and amounts canceled may
not be reinstated.

The undrawn amount of any Commitment under any Facility shall be
automatically canceled at the close of business on the last day of the
availability period of that Facility.

If any sum payable to any Lender or Ancillary Facility Lender or L/C
Bank by an Obligor is required to be increased under the tax gross-up
provisions in the Credit Facility, any Lender or Ancillary Facility Lender
or L/C Bank claims indemnification from VMIH or a Borrower under the
tax indemnity provisions in the Credit Facility or any Lender or Ancillary
Facility Lender or L/C Bank invokes the market disruption provisions of
the Credit Facility or seeks mandatory prepayment as a result of any
illegality, where such circumstances relate to a Lender, VMIH may
arrange for the transfer and assignment of the whole (at par only) of that
Lender’s Commitment and participation in the Utilisations to a new or
existing Lender willing to accept that transfer or assignment.

17. Security The Credit Facility requires that members of the Bank Group which
generate not less than 80% of the EBITDA of the Bank Group (excluding
the consolidated net income attributable to any joint venture) in any
financial year grant first-ranking security over all or substantially all of
their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable under the Credit
Facility and related finance documentation; provided that the EBITDA of
any member of the Bank Group that is not required to (or cannot) become
a Guarantor and grant security due to the agreed security principles shall
be disregarded for this calculation.

On and after the Asset Security Release Date, the security shall be limited
to (i) share pledges of all of the capital stock of the Borrowers and the
Obligors thereunder and (ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors in
relation to certain intercompany loans.

18. Representation and The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties for
**Warranties** this type of agreement (subject to agreed exceptions, materiality and

20. Financial Covenant The Credit Facility requires that in the event that on the last day of a Ratio
Period, the aggregate of the Revolving Facility Outstandings and any
Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to any Additional Facility that
is a revolving facility (other than cash collateralized or undrawn
documentary credits) and the net indebtedness outstanding under each
Ancillary Facility, less Cash of the Bank Group, exceeds an amount equal
to 50% of the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitments and any
Additional Facility Commitments and each Ancillary Facility
Commitment (the “Financial Ratio Test Condition”), VMIH shall

87


-----

procure that the ratio of Total Net Debt to Annualized EBITDA on that
day (the “Financial Ratio”) shall not exceed 5.50:1 unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Composite Revolving Facility Instructing Group
and VMIH.

In circumstances where the Financial Ratio above has been breached for a
Ratio Period but is complied with on the last day of the next Ratio Period
(either because the Financial Ratio Test Condition is not met for that next
Ratio Period or because the Financial Ratio does not exceed 5.50:1 for
that next Ratio Period) then the prior breach of the financial covenant or
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall not (or shall be deemed to
not) directly or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of any
representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Relevant
Finance Documents or a Default or an Event of Default unless the Facility
Agent has taken any action under the maintenance covenant acceleration
provisions prior to the delivery of compliance certificate in respect of that
next Ratio Period.

VMIH may, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Credit Facility,
cure a breach of the Financial Ratio by procuring that (i) additional equity
is injected into the Bank Group, (ii) additional Subordinated Funding is
provided to one or more members of the Bank Group and/or (iii) the
Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or Additional Facility Outstandings
in relation to any Additional Facility that is a revolving facility are
prepaid such that if the prepayment had occurred immediately prior to the
calculation on the last day of the Ratio Period in respect of which the
breach arose, the Financial Ratio Test Condition would not have been met
and the Financial Ratio would not have been required to be tested,
(iv) non-cash assets are contributed to one or more members of the Bank
Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the amount which
if it had been deducted from Total Net Debt for the Ratio Period in respect
of which the breach arose, would have avoided the breach and
(v) non-cash assets are contributed to one or more members of the Bank
Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the amount which
if it had been added to EBITDA for the Ratio Period in respect of which
the breach arose, would have avoided the breach.

VMIH has to comply with a separate financial covenant in relation to each
of Facility X1 and Facility X1A for the sole benefit of the Lenders under
that facility. There is a separate equity cure regime available in relation to
this financial covenant and an independent right for the Lenders under
that facility to accelerate if the financial covenant is breached.

21. Events of Default The Credit Facility contains customary events of default for this type of
agreement, including without limitation (and subject to agreed exceptions,

(a) non-payment under the Relevant Finance Documents;

(b) breach of covenants or breach of other provisions of the Relevant
Finance Documents;

(c) a representation or warranty is incorrect in any material respect;

(d) cross-default and cross-acceleration;

(e) insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, moratorium, administration,
enforcement proceedings, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
similar, of any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

(f) any formal voluntary steps towards insolvency proceedings, any
meetings or filing in connection with such proceedings, any petition
for winding-up or similar, or the appointment, or request of
appointment, of liquidator, administrator, receiver or similar in
respect of any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

(g) enforcement of a distress, execution, attachment or other legal
process against any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

88


-----

(h) unlawfulness of performance of obligations under the Relevant
Finance Documents or the repudiation of any Relevant Finance
Document;

(i) cessation by the Bank Group (taken as a whole) of all or substantially
all of its business;

(j) breach of the terms of the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the
HYD Intercreditor Agreement by any member of the Wider Group;

(k) loss, breach or failure to renew material licenses;

(l) any event or series of events reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and

(m) the Composite Revolving Facility Instructing Group directs the
Facility Agent to take any acceleration action as a result of a breach
of the undertaking in relation to the Financial Ratio, as described
above.

22. Tax All payments under the Credit Facility must be made free and clear of any
taxes, deductions or withholdings unless required by law. The applicable
Borrower shall gross-up if necessary with respect to a Lender that is a
Qualifying Lender and Lenders shall reimburse any tax credit received as
a result. If any gross up is necessary, the applicable Borrower may, while
the requirement continues, give notice requesting prepayment and
cancellation in respect of the relevant Lender.

23. Amendments and Waivers Any term of the Finance Documents can be amended or waived only with
the written consent of the Instructing Group and the Obligors affected.

However certain waivers and amendments require the consent of each
affected Lender including, without limitation:

(a) an increase in the principal amount of any Commitment;

(b) a reduction in Margin, interest payments, fees or other amounts due;

(c) an extension of maturity and any deferral of any payment; and

(d) any change in the currency of account.

Any amendment or waiver which relates only to the rights or obligations
applicable to a particular Utilisation or Facility and does not materially
and adversely affect the rights or interests of other Lenders may be made
in accordance with the amendment provisions but as if references in such
provisions to the specified proportion of Lenders whose consent would,
but for this class exception, be required for that amendment or waiver
were to that proportion of the Lenders participating in that particular
Utilisation or Facility.

Each Lender that does not respond to a request for waiver or amendment
within 10 Business Days after receipt by it of such request from the
Facility Agent (or within such other period as the Facility Agent and
VMIH may specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in
determining whether the requisite level of consent to such waiver or
amendment was granted.

Upon the completion of any disposal of any shares or assets which is a
permitted disposal or permitted internal reorganization then the Security
Trustee will execute all documents as required to release those assets from
the Security. VMIH can also request the Security Trustee to execute such
documents as may be required to release any Obligor which is no longer
required to satisfy the Credit Facility 80% Security Test.

VMIH can request that Lenders take a transfer of the rights and
obligations of a Non-Consenting Lender. Any Non-Consenting Lender is
required to transfer its rights and obligations to Lenders who agree to
accept such a transfer.

89


-----

24. Transferability None of the rights, benefits and obligations of the VMED O2 Senior
Notes Issuer or an Obligor under the Credit Facility can be assigned or
transferred (without the consent of all Lenders) provided that a Borrower
may assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits and obligations to another
Borrower incorporated in the same jurisdiction and which is a directly or
indirectly wholly-owned Subsidiary of the VMED O2 Senior Notes Issuer
or any Permitted Affiliate Parent (as applicable).

Lenders can transfer, assign or sub-participate their rights, benefits and
obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents at any time subject to
the following:

(a) a partial transfer must be in a minimum amount of £1,000,000,
$1,000,000 or €1,000,000 (as applicable) unless the aggregate of the
commitments under any Facility is less than such amount, in which
case it is permitted to transfer or assign its entire commitment for
such Facility;

(b) the prior consent of VMIH (not to be unreasonably withheld and
shall be deemed to have been given if not declined in writing within
five Business Days of a written request by any Lender) is required
unless transfer is to another Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or certain
Events of Default have occurred including non-payment, insolvency,
insolvency proceedings or creditor’s process; and

(c) a transfer or assignment is effected by a duly complete and executed
Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement and the new lender and
particulars concerning the transferred interests are entered into the
Register.

An existing Lender is not responsible to a new Lender and a new Lender
confirms it has carried out its own appraisal of the Obligors.

No Lender shall be entitled to assign, transfer or sub-participate any of its
rights, benefits or obligations in relation to the Revolving Facility without
the prior written consent of VMIH, provided that no such consent shall be
required in the case of any assignment, transfer or Sub-participation (i) to
another Lender under the Revolving Facility and/or to an Affiliate, in each
case, which is an authorized deposit taking financial institution and
subject to a minimum credit rating and (ii) to any New Lender after the
occurrence of certain non-payment and insolvency Events of Default
which are continuing.

There is no restriction on sub-participations provided that the Lender
remains a Lender under the Credit Facility with all rights and obligations
and remains liable for such and retains exclusive control over all rights
and obligations in relation to the participations and Commitments,
including all voting rights.

25. Governing Law The Credit Facility is governed by the laws of England and Wales.

26. Miscellaneous The Credit Facility is subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
English courts and contains service of process, waiver of immunity and
waiver of trial by jury clauses.

**_Proposed Amendments to the Credit Facility_**

The proposed amendments, waivers, consents and other modifications to the Credit Facility set forth in
Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of Annex D to this offering memorandum (the “Credit Facility Amendments”) can be
implemented once the requisite level of consents from Lenders (i.e. from Lenders constituting the “Instructing
Group” as currently defined), which may include consents from lenders under future term loan or revolving
credit facilities, has been obtained. Certain of the Credit Facility Amendments will only become effective only
upon the approval of all affected lenders under the Credit Facility. Upon receipt of the required consents from
Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility and the other creditors under certain financing arrangements of
the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will
cease to govern the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New

90

Group Intercreditor Agreement will establish the relative rights of the Credit Facility Lenders, the holders of the

commitments and loans of the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender thereunder will also be included in those of the
Lenders outstanding under the Credit Facility for the purposes of implementation of the Credit Facility
Amendments.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (the “Issuer”), will issue the Notes (as defined below) under the Indenture
(the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, between, among others, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trustees
Limited as Trustee (as defined below), BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as Security Trustee (as
defined below). You will find the definitions of capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this description under
the heading “—Certain Definitions”.

For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to:

(1) “Issuer” refers only to VMED O2 UK Financing I plc;

(2) “Credit Facility Borrower” refers only to VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 Limited and not to any of its
subsidiaries;

(3) “Virgin Media” refers only to Virgin Media Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries; and

(4) “VMED O2 UK Holdco 5” refers only to VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 Limited and not to any of its
subsidiaries.

(5) “VMIH” refers only to Virgin Media Investment Holdings Limited and not to any of its subsidiaries.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but the aggregate principal amount of Notes
issued in this offering is limited to € million % senior secured notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The Issuer
may issue an unlimited amount of Additional Notes (as defined below) having identical terms and conditions to
the Notes under the Indenture. See “—Principal, Maturity and Interest”.

Except as otherwise stated herein, the Notes will be treated as a single class of Notes under the Indenture,
including with respect to waivers and amendments. As a result, among other things, holders of the Notes will not
have separate and independent rights to give notice of a Default or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies in
the event of a Default with respect to the Notes or otherwise.

The Issuer is expected to apply to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
(the “Exchange”).

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture, and refers to the Credit Facility, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco Facility € Deed
of Covenant, the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and the
Notes Security Documents (each as defined below). As this “Description of the Notes” does not restate those
agreements in their entirety and is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture, the Credit Facility, the
Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Finco Facility € Fee Letter,
the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and the Notes Security Documents because they, and
not this description, define your direct and indirect rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the
Credit Facility, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Finco
Facility € Fee Letter, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and the Notes Security
Documents are available as described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Credit Facility is attached as
Annex A to this Offering Memorandum. Forms of the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant and the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement are attached as Annex B and Annex D to this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes will initially be held in registered global form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated
as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry
_Settlement and Clearance”._

**Summary Description of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an accession agreement to the Credit Facility, in substantially
the form attached as Annex D to this Offering Memorandum, with the Credit Facility Borrower and the Credit
Facility Agent (the “Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”), pursuant to which the Issuer will make available
to the Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued in the offering.

The Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other Credit Facility Lenders and will
have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other

110


-----

Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the Finco Loans
(including the Finco Loan € (as defined below)) granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be
provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender,
including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the guarantees granted by the
Credit Facility Guarantors and the Credit Facility Collateral. See “Description of the Credit Facility and the
_Related Agreements”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of the Bank Group (as defined in the Credit_
Facility) under the Credit Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same way as the other Credit Facility Lenders,
with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis described in this “Description of the Notes” and to
receive principal and interest on the Finco Loan €, which it will in turn use to make payments on the Notes. For a
description of procedures under the Indenture and the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement relating to the
voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to decisions under the Credit Facility, see below under
“—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement”.

Under the Credit Facility, to the extent the Bank Group is in compliance with certain financial covenants,
the borrowers under the Credit Facility, at their discretion and without the consent of the Credit Facility Lenders,
are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to additional Credit Facility Loans under the
Credit Facility, which benefit from the protections provided to all Credit Facility Lenders, including the
representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security provided thereunder. For a further description
of the Credit Facility, see “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements”. The Credit Facility is
attached as Annex A to this Offering Memorandum.

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer
(if any) from the Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund
a loan (the “Finco Loan €”) borrowed under an additional facility (the “Finco Facility €”) established pursuant
to the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement under the Credit Facility, and the Issuer will become a Credit
Facility Lender.

The principal amount of the Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan €.

As of December 31, 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions (including the borrowing of the
Finco Loan €) as described in “Use of Proceeds”, £ billion (equivalent) principal amount of
indebtedness would have been outstanding under the Credit Facility. See “Capitalization of VMED O2 UK
_Holdings” and “Capitalization of the Issuer”. This amount includes £_ million (equivalent), or
% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, representing the Finco Loan
€. The Refinancing Transactions are still to be determined and certain outstanding amounts of our senior secured
debt, including the Credit Facility, may be reduced as a result of the consummation of such Refinancing
Transactions, which have not been reflected herein.

In addition to indirect benefits arising from the protections and security afforded to the Issuer as a Credit
Facility Lender, holders of the Notes will also benefit directly from the security interests in the Collateral (as
described and defined below under “—Notes Collateral”). Further, if an Event of Default is continuing under the
Indenture or the Notes, holders of the Notes will be entitled to direct the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee to
enforce their rights under the Notes, the Indenture and, in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing
Agreement, the Notes Security Documents, in which case the holders of the Notes will have multiple available
remedies (through the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as applicable), including declaring the Notes due and
payable.

For more information on Events of Default and Remedies, see “—Events of Default and Remedies” and
“—Collateral Sharing Agreement”.

**Certain Transaction Documents**

**_Finco Facility € Accession Agreement and the Credit Facility_**

On the Issue Date, in connection with the Finco Loan €, the Issuer, the Credit Facility Borrower and the
Credit Facility Agent will enter into the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will
accede to the Credit Facility as a Credit Facility Lender. The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will set out
the principal economic terms of the Finco Facility € and the Finco Loan € and the form of the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement is attached as Annex D to this Offering Memorandum.

111


-----

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with fees payable to the Issuer (if any) by the
Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer on the Issue Date
to fund the Finco Loan €, denominated in euro, to the Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility €.

On the Issue Date, upon acceding to the Credit Facility as a Credit Facility Lender pursuant to the Finco
Facility € Accession Agreement, the Issuer will benefit from:

(1) all the rights of a Credit Facility Lender under the Credit Facility and the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement, including the protections of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of
default set out in the Credit Facility except in certain limited circumstances expressly outlined in Finco
Facility € Accession Agreement or the Credit Facility. In particular, the financial covenant set out in the
Credit Facility shall not be for the benefit of the Issuer as a Credit Facility Lender;

(2) rights under the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, pursuant to which the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH
and VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 will agree with the Issuer to comply (or procure the Issuer’s compliance) with
the covenants described below under “—Redemption and Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”, “—Redemption
_and Repurchase—Open Market Purchases of Credit Facility Loans”, “—Information”, “—Minimum Period_
_for Consents under Credit Facility Loan Documents”, “—Payments for Consents” and “—Amendments to_
_Credit Facility Loan Documents to be applied equally to all Credit Facility Lenders”;_

(3) rights under the Finco Facility € Fee Letter relating to certain fees payable to the Issuer in connection with
the entering into of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement and the advancing of the Finco Loan €; and

(4) rights under the Expenses Agreement, pursuant to which VMIH will agree to pay (i) the fees and expenses
of the Issuer incurred from time to time in connection with or related to the Issuer’s performance of its
obligations under the Indenture and the maintenance of the Issuer’s existence, (ii) certain tax liabilities of
the Issuer, (iii) any Additional Amounts payable under the Indenture and (iv) any additional interest
required to be paid under the Notes on overdue principal and interest.

Subject to certain provisions to reflect the Transactions, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will be
similar in form to any accession agreement entered into by any other Additional Facility Lender (as defined in
the Credit Facility) and will include additional rights that are specific to the Finco Loan €, including the maturity
date of, the rate of interest accruing on, and the interest periods applicable to such Finco Loan €. In addition, the
Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will provide for the payment of certain premiums in connection with
certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the Finco Loan € that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums
applicable to corresponding redemptions of the Notes, as described below under “—Redemption and
_Repurchase”. The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will constitute a “Finance Document” for purposes of_
the Credit Facility.

The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement will further provide that the Issuer will accede to the Group
Intercreditor Deed and the High Yield Intercreditor Deed as a Credit Facility Lender and will be bound by the
terms and provisions of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the High Yield Intercreditor Deed in its capacity as a
lender. See “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds”.

Under the Credit Facility, Credit Facility Lenders are not allowed to split or divide their votes with respect
to matters arising thereunder requiring the vote (or other consent) of Credit Facility Lenders. For a description of
procedures under the Indenture regarding voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to decisions under the
Credit Facility, see below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Credit Facility or the Finco
_Facility € Accession Agreement”._

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility. In
the event that the Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)
(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter arising from time to time under
the Credit Facility or under the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, as applicable, in which all Credit Facility
Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other
consents) from the holders of the Notes and any other applicable series of Additional Debt (including the
Existing Notes) with respect to such Credit Facility Decision (as defined below) in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Credit
_Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement” and “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents_
_under Credit Facility Loan Documents”. However, the Issuer will, under (and effective as of the date of) the_
Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, provide its consent as a Credit
Facility Lender, to any and all of the amendments set forth in Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 to the Finco

112


-----

Facility € Accession Agreement (the “Credit Facility Amendments”) (notwithstanding that the Issuer may
otherwise be eligible to vote as a Credit Facility Lender if the borrowers sought the consent of the Credit Facility
Lenders with respect to such matters). The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder Consent (as defined below)
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding in respect of any of the Credit Facility
Amendments for the purposes of the provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment,
_Supplement and Waiver—To the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement” and “—Certain_
_Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under Credit Facility Loan Documents”. As a result, the Issuer will_
not solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the Notes with respect to the Credit Facility
Amendments. In addition, the Issuer will not be entitled to receive, and will expressly waive under the Finco
Facility € Accession Agreement, any right it may have to, any consent, waiver, amendment or other similar fee
that may be paid to other Credit Facility Lenders in connection with their approval of the Credit Facility
Amendments (including the Issuer in respect of any additional Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, or similar
instrument or agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer advances the proceeds of Additional Debt (including any
Additional Notes) into the Bank Group). The Credit Facility Amendments include material modifications to
certain affirmative and negative covenants, financial maintenance covenants and related definitions,
representations and warranties, events of default, administrative provisions and provisions relating to the security
package securing the Credit Facility and the approval of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (in substantially
the form attached as Annex C to this Offering Memorandum). The Credit Facility Amendments are generally less
restrictive and provide greater flexibility to the Bank Group than the provisions currently included in the Credit
Facility. Specifically, the Credit Facility Amendments include, but are not limited to, the following (capitalized

The above description is intended to summarize certain material amendments included in the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement but is not a complete and exhaustive list of such amendments and does not restate the
proposed amendments listed in Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement in their
entirety. Given the significant nature of these amendments, you should read the full list of amendments set out in
Schedules 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement in their entirety before investing in the
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—By investing in the Notes you will have
_provided advance consent to the Credit Facility Amendments which will automatically become effective without_
_any further consent from holders of the Notes upon VMIH obtaining the consent of either the Instructing Group_
_(as defined in the Credit Facility) or, with respect to certain amendments, all Credit Facility Lenders”._

The Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective upon the approval by lenders constituting
the Instructing Group (as currently defined in the Credit Facility, without giving effect to the Credit Facility
Amendments). However, certain of the Credit Facility Amendments, including those related to extending the date
of any payment and releasing guarantors, will become effective only upon the approval of all Credit Facility
Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility and the other
creditors under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the
terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the Credit Facility and the Existing VMED O2
Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement will establish the relative rights
of the Credit Facility Lenders, the holders of the Existing VMED O2 Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors
under other financing arrangements of the Group.

References in this “Description of the Notes” and the Indenture to numbered clauses or sections in the Credit
Facility refer to such clauses or sections as numbered as of the date of the Indenture and, in the event the Credit
Facility is amended or supplemented after the date of the Indenture, to any substantially similar clause or section
after such amendment or supplement whether numbered the same or differently after such amendment or
supplement.

_Credit Facility Guarantors_

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Credit Facility Guarantors are the only guarantors of the
Credit Facility (subject to certain specified guarantee limitations, including, but not limited to, the exclusion of
liability to the extent that such guarantee would constitute unlawful financial assistance under applicable Law).
As a result, on the Issue Date, the Finco Loan € will benefit from the guarantees of the Credit Facility Guarantors
pursuant to the Credit Facility.

_Finco Loan € Collateral_

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Credit Facility Loans are, or will be, secured by all of the
assets of the Obligors (as defined in the Credit Facility) granted to the Credit Facility Security Trustee as security
under the Credit Facility which consists primarily of (i) all or substantially all assets of the Obligors and (ii) in
connection with the accession and designation of the Credit Facility Borrower as a “Permitted Affiliate Parent”
(as defined in the Credit Facility) first-ranking security over all of the shares of the Credit Facility Borrower and
its rights as borrower in relation to certain intragroup loans.

On or after the Asset Security Release Date (as defined in the Credit Facility), the security granted to secure
the Credit Facility Loans will, however, be limited to (i) share pledges over all of the capital stock of the
Borrowers and the other Obligors under (and each as defined in) the Credit Facility and (ii) a pledge of rights of
the relevant creditors in relation to certain intercompany loans, and all other Credit Facility Collateral will be
released.

The foregoing assets securing the Credit Facility Loans, including the Finco Loan €, from time to time are
hereinafter referred to as the “Credit Facility Collateral”. For a description of the Credit Facility Collateral, see
“Description of the Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—Credit Facility—Guarantees and Security”.

For a further description of the Credit Facility, see “Description of the Credit Facility and the Related
_Agreements”._

Borrower of certain up-front fees to the Issuer in connection with the offering of the Notes. The Issuer will
allocate a portion of such fees equal to the original issue discount, if any, on the Notes, to the Credit Facility
Borrower under the Finco Loan € such that the principal amount of the Finco Loan € equals the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes issued in this offering. The Finco Facility € Fee Letter shall also provide for the
payment of certain up-front fees by the Credit Facility Borrower to the direct parent of the Issuer, and the
payment by the direct parent of the Issuer of such up-front fees to the Issuer (the “Additional Issue Date
**Amounts”). On the Issue Date, the Additional Issue Date Amounts will be on-lent by the Issuer to the Credit**
Facility Borrower pursuant to the Additional Issue Date Amounts Loan.

**_Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant_**

Under a deed of covenant between the Issuer, the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH and VMED O2 UK
Holdco 5 (the “Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant”), the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH and VMED O2 UK
Holdco 5 will contractually agree to ensure the compliance by the Issuer with certain covenants in relation to the
Indenture, so long as any Notes remain outstanding. The form of the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant is
attached as Annex B to this Offering Memorandum.

**_Expenses Agreement_**

The Issuer and VMIH have entered into an expenses agreement dated September 24, 2020 (the “Expenses
**Agreement”), in respect of the reimbursement by VMIH of certain ongoing obligations of the Issuer, including**
in respect of the performance of its obligations under the Indenture, the maintenance of the Issuer’s existence, the
payment of certain tax liabilities of the Issuer, the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, payable under the
Indenture and the payment of additional interest required to be paid under the Notes on overdue principal and
interest.

**_Additional Issue Date Amounts Loan_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an accession to the Existing Finco Facility Issue Date Amounts
Loan (the “Additional Issue Date Amounts Loan”) with the Credit Facility Borrower and/or the relevant
member of the Bank Group, pursuant to which the Issuer shall lend, and the Credit Facility Borrower and/or the
relevant member of the Bank Group shall borrow, the Additional Issue Date Amounts under one or more loans.

**_Collateral Sharing Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Collateral Sharing Agreement that governs the relative
rights of creditors under the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and any Additional Debt of the Issuer that
benefits from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, all
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be shared on a pari passu basis by the holders of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) and the creditors of all Additional Debt of the Issuer that benefits from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. The Collateral Sharing Agreement sets out, among other things, (i) the
relevant ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, (ii) the consent level of the senior creditors required to cast votes
and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions and remedies under the Indenture, the Notes, the
Notes Security Documents and the other debt instruments or agreements sharing in the Collateral (including the
Existing Notes), when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the Collateral by the Security Trustee and
(iii) turnover provisions. The holders and/or lenders, as applicable, of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and all Additional Debt then outstanding will control any enforcement
actions in respect of the Collateral.

The Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, the Finco Facility € Deed of
Covenant, the Expenses Agreement, Additional Issue Date Amounts Loan and the Collateral Sharing Agreement
are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents”.

**Summary Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

      - will be senior and limited recourse obligations of the Issuer;

      - will be secured by the Collateral (as described under “—Notes Collateral”);

      - will rank pari passu in right of payment to all Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including any Additional Notes), including the
Existing Notes;

117


-----

      - will be subject to the Limited Recourse Restrictions; and

      - will be effectively subordinated to any future Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured
by Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes, or secured by property and assets that do not
secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Financial
Indebtedness.

The Issuer will not be entitled to incur any additional Financial Indebtedness (other than Additional Notes
and any other Additional Debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Indenture). See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer”._

**_Notes Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, subject to limitations under applicable Law described elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, the holders of the Notes will benefit directly from security interests to be granted to the Security
Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the following rights, property and assets
(the “Collateral”):

(1) all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Finco Loan € (including all rights of the Issuer as a Credit
Facility Lender under the Credit Facility and the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement);

(2) all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Deeds of Covenant, the Fee Letters, the Expenses
Agreement (excluding any transaction fees payable to the Issuer pursuant thereto and the Issuer’s rights to
be indemnified in respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts payable to parties that do not
benefit from the security interests in the Collateral) and the Issue Date Amounts Loans; and

(3) all sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the Issuer (excluding any transaction fees
payable pursuant to the Expenses Agreement),

in each case, on a pari passu basis with any Additional Notes and any other existing or future Additional Debt of
the Issuer, including the Existing Notes, that is not subordinated to the Notes, in accordance with the terms of the
Collateral Sharing Agreement.

The Security Trustee will enter into the Notes Security Documents relating to the Collateral described above
with the other relevant parties thereto. The security interests in the Collateral will secure the performance of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes as provided in the relevant Notes Security Document
and to the extent specified therein, subject to the provisions, among others, described below under “—Events of
_Default and Remedies” and “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”. Subject to certain conditions, including_
the compliance with the covenant described under “—Impairment of Liens”, the Issuer is permitted to pledge the
Collateral in connection with future issuances of Additional Debt, including any Additional Notes, in each case
permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Financial Indebtedness,
and the creditors (or representative thereof) of any such Additional Debt of the Issuer that will benefit from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis will become party to the Collateral Sharing Agreement. The Collateral
Sharing Agreement provides that the Liens in the Collateral may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the
amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default, subject to and in accordance with its terms. Neither
the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any
rights in their favor under the Notes Security Documents. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only take
action to enforce the Notes Security Documents through the Security Trustee and the Collateral Sharing
Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the ability of the Security Trustee to
enforce the Liens in the Collateral will be restricted and will be at the discretion of the relevant creditors.

The Notes Security Documents provide for the Security Trustee to release the security created thereby upon
discharge of the Indenture, in accordance with its terms, as described below under “—Release of the Collateral”.

_Release of the Collateral_

The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the
Notes;

(2) to release and/or re-take a lien on the Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture (including, without limitation, as may be permitted by the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Liens”);_

118


-----

(3) with the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
(including without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or
purchase of, the Notes);

(4) following an Event of Default under the Indenture or a default under other Financial Indebtedness secured
by the Collateral, pursuant to an enforcement in accordance with the Collateral Sharing Agreement; and

(5) upon satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as provided below under the caption “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”._

Upon certification by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Collateral Sharing Agreement, to effectuate any release in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications to the satisfaction of the
Trustee and the Security Trustee. The Security Trustee and/or Trustee (as applicable) will agree to any release of
the security interests created by the Notes Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes
Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders.

**_Limited Recourse Obligations_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be
limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the Issuer under the Indenture (including any
Additional Amounts), the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be made only from and to the extent of
such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Security Trustee under the
Collateral, including the Issuer’s rights under the Credit Facility and the Transaction Documents and none of the
Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Registrar (as defined below), any Paying Agent (as defined below) or the
holders of the Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event that the amount
due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents exceeds the
amounts so received or recovered under the Collateral, including the Issuer’s rights under the Credit Facility and
the Transaction Documents (the “Limited Recourse Restrictions”).

Holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of any other member of the Bank
Group and no other member of the Bank Group will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay
amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH and the other Credit Facility Guarantors, as applicable, to
make payments to Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit Facility, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement,
the Finco Facility € Fee Letter and the Expenses Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any interest or other
amounts payable in respect of the Notes to which recourse is limited pursuant to the Limited Recourse
Restrictions will be deferred and not cancelled.

Because the holders of the Notes will benefit from the assignment of rights under certain agreements
between the Issuer and members of the Bank Group, in certain circumstances described below under “—Events
_of Default and Remedies”, the Security Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, will be able to assert the_
contractual rights of the Issuer against members of the Bank Group, subject to any limitations set forth in the
Credit Facility (and in an enforcement action holders of the Notes may instruct the Security Trustee to demand
such performance). However, these rights are limited to the Issuer’s contractual rights against any member of the
Bank Group and provide for no direct claims into any other member of the Bank Group.

No Credit Facility Guarantor or any of their subsidiaries will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes.

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer has been formed as a financing company for the purposes of issuing the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) and any other Additional Debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Indenture. The
Issuer has no material business operations and upon completion of this offering will have no material assets other
than the Finco Loan € to be advanced in connection with the offering of the Notes as described below under
“—Finco Facility € Accession Agreement and the Credit Facility”, its rights under the Transaction Documents
and its rights under the Existing Finco Loans and certain other related agreements. As a result, the Issuer will be
primarily dependent on payments by the Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Loan € in order to service its
obligations under the Notes.

119


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue in this offering € million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer
may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”) under the Indenture from time to time after this offering.
Any issuance of Additional Notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture. The Notes issued in this
offering and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as part of the same
issue as the Notes issued in this offering for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation,
waivers, amendments, consents, other determinations, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise
provided in the Indenture. Any reference to “Notes” in this “Description of the Notes” shall be deemed to include
any Additional Notes. In connection with the issuance of Additional Notes, the Issuer and the Credit Facility
Borrower will upsize Finco Loan € pursuant to an increase confirmation or an accession agreement or enter into
one or more accession agreements under the Credit Facility, each of which will constitute a “Finco Facility
**€ Accession Agreement” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents. The proceeds of any such**
Additional Notes will be loaned to the Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to a loan under such Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement and each such loan will constitute a “Finco Loan €” for purposes of the Indenture and
related documents. Consideration for any Additional Notes may be paid in cash or otherwise.

The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes will mature on April 15, 2032.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in euro semiannually in arrear on each April 15 and October 15, commencing on October 15, 2024.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or the last interest payment date, as applicable. Interest
on overdue principal and interest then due will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher than the then applicable
interest rate on the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Expenses Agreement described above, VMIH will make
payments to the Issuer to enable it to pay the additional interest required to be paid under the Notes on overdue
principal and interest. The Issuer will make each interest payment for so long as the Notes are Global Notes (as
defined below) to the holders of record of the Notes at the close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on
the Clearing System Business Day immediately before the due date for such payment, where “Clearing System
**Business Day” means a day on which each clearing system for which the Global Note is being held is open for**
business, or, to the extent Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) have been issued, to the holders of
record of the Notes on the immediately preceding April 1 and October 1. Interest will be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at
the corporate trust office or agency of the Paying Agent in London, England except that, at the option of the
Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the holders of the Notes as such
address appears in the Note register. Payments on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be made to the
common depositary or its nominee as the registered holder of the Global Notes.

The rights of holders to receive the payments of principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional
Amounts, if any, on such Global Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes issued in certificated
non-global form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in London,
England, except that, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address
of the holders of Definitive Registered Notes as such address appears in the register for Definitive Registered
Notes. The Issuer will pay interest on Definitive Registered Notes to persons who are registered holders at the
close of business on the record date immediately preceding the interest payment date for such interest. Such
holders must surrender their Definitive Registered Notes to the Paying Agent to collect principal payments.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the holders thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

**Paying Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”). Elavon Financial Services
DAC, UK Branch will initially act as Paying Agent.

120


-----

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar for the Notes (each, a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar for the
Notes will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent. The initial transfer
agent with respect to the Notes will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register on
behalf of the Issuer for so long as the Notes remain outstanding reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered
Notes outstanding from time to time. The Paying Agents will facilitate payments on the Notes, and the transfer
agents will facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. In the event that the Notes
are no longer listed, the Issuer or its agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes.

The Issuer may change a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
holders of the Notes, and the Issuer may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes. In the
event that a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent is replaced, the Issuer will provide notice thereof in
accordance with the procedures described under “—Notices”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest coupons
attached, as follows:

    - The Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of
Rule 144A that are also “qualified purchasers” within the meaning of section 2(a)(51) of the 1940 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (each, a “Qualified Purchaser”), pursuant to Rule 144A will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes, will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name
of a nominee of the common depositary.

    - The Notes sold to non-US persons in offshore transactions outside the United States pursuant to (and as
defined in) Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more permanent global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with
the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date,
be deposited with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered
in the name of a nominee of the common depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Transfer Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities Law of any other jurisdiction._

Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A that is
also a Qualified Purchaser in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities Law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

121


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in
compliance with applicable Law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental
charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such
transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Note in registered form:

(1) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 calendar days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to any interest payment date; or

(4) for any period during which the registered holder of a Note has tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with an Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the transfer agents will
be entitled to treat the registered holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Security Trustee**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited will act as Security Trustee under the Notes Security
Documents until such time, if any, that a new Security Trustee is appointed under the relevant provisions of the
Indenture.

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Trustee nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of any
property securing the Notes, for the legality, enforceability, effectiveness or sufficiency of the Notes Security
Documents, for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any security interest under any
Notes Security Document, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such matters, or for any failure to demand,
collect, foreclose or realize upon or otherwise enforce any of the Notes Security Documents or any delay in doing
so.

**Redemption and Repurchase**

**_Disposal Proceeds_**

Under the Credit Facility, VMIH is required to prepay, or to procure the prepayment of (in either case,
unless otherwise waived in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Facility), the Credit Facility Loans in
relation to Term Facilities (as defined in the Credit Facility) under the Credit Facility with certain proceeds of
asset disposals (“Disposal Proceeds”), subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the Credit Facility and
_the Related Agreements—Credit Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches— Mandatory Prepayment”. VMIH_
may elect which Credit Facility Loans are to be prepaid in connection with any mandatory prepayment with
Disposal Proceeds. Under the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH and
VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 will agree that, with respect to the Finco Loan € and any Disposal Proceeds that are
required to be applied to prepay any Credit Facility Loans in relation to Term Facilities pursuant to Clause 12.2

122


-----

(Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) of the Credit Facility, an amount of such Disposal Proceeds that
bears the same proportion to the total Disposal Proceeds as the aggregate principal amount that the Finco Loan
€ bears to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Credit Facility Loans under Term Facilities (the
“Available Disposal Proceeds”) will be available for prepayment of such Finco Loan €.

In respect of the Available Disposal Proceeds, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 and/or the Credit Facility
Borrower will elect, at their option:

(1) to offer to prepay a principal amount of the Finco Loan € equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the
Available Disposal Proceeds and (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered in an Asset Sale
Offer to be made by the Issuer following receipt of notice from VMIH as set forth below; or

(2) to prepay the Finco Loan € on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to the Available Disposal Proceeds, in
which case the Issuer will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Notes equal to the amount of the
Finco Loan € prepaid, as described below.

_Asset Sale Offer_

Following receipt of notice of an asset disposal from VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5, the Credit Facility
Borrower or ay member of the Bank Group, delivered pursuant to the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the
Issuer will, within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, make an offer to all holders of the Notes (an
“Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of the Notes that may be purchased out of the
Available Disposal Proceeds stated in such notice at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase,
subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date, which offer price will be payable in cash.

Under the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 or the Credit Facility
Borrower have agreed to pay (or procure the payment of) an amount of the Finco Loan € based on the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer equal to the lesser of (i) the Available Disposal
Proceeds and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer, and the Issuer will
accept for purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Notes in such Asset Sale Offer. The Issuer will
apply any such prepayment of the Finco Loan €, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but
excluding, the date of prepayment, to pay the purchase price of all Notes accepted for purchase in such Asset
Sale Offer.

The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee and VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 and the Credit Facility
Borrower of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the relevant amount of the Available
Disposal Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased based on the amounts tendered on a pro rata
basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, based on the procedures of the applicable depository).

The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange
Act, and any other applicable securities Laws or regulations in connection with an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent
that the provisions of any applicable securities Laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant
(other than the obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the Issuer will comply with such securities
Laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by
virtue thereof.

_Redemption with Disposal Proceeds_

Under the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, if the Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH or VMED O2 UK
Holdco 5 elects not to offer to prepay the Finco Loan € in an amount equal to the lesser of the Available Disposal
Proceeds and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered in a related Asset Sale Offer, it is required to
prepay (or procure the payment of) the Finco Loan € in an amount equal to the Available Disposal Proceeds, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Finco Loan € at the applicable price for any voluntary prepayment to, but
excluding, the date of prepayment. The Credit Facility Borrower or VMIH is required to give not less than 10
Business Days’ notice of any such prepayment. Any prepayment pursuant to this provision shall be pro rata
across the Finco Loan €.

Following receipt of prepayment of the Finco Loan € described in the preceding paragraph, the Issuer will
promptly redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Notes equal to the redemption price that would be payable

123


-----

if such Notes were redeemed on such date pursuant to the provisions described below under “—Optional
_Redemption”, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on_
the relevant interest payment date.

**_Redemption upon a Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of any mandatory prepayment of any or all of the Finco Loan € following a Change of
Control (as defined under Clause 12.1 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation—Change of Control) of the
Credit Facility), the Issuer will redeem the corresponding aggregate principal amount of the Notes, subject to and
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Credit Facility, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Credit Facility
Loans thereunder (including the Finco Loan €) will only become due and payable if the Instructing Group so
requires. The Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, will be entitled to vote the Finco Loan € in accordance with the
provisions described below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Credit Facility or the Finco
_Facility € Accession Agreement”. Depending on how the other Credit Facility Lenders vote in the determination_
of whether to require prepayment, holders of the Notes may have no right to demand redemption of the Notes by
the Issuer following the occurrence of a Change of Control.

**_Optional Redemption_**

In the event that all or any portion of the Finco Loan € is voluntarily prepaid by the Credit Facility Borrower
pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Facility (an “Early Redemption Event”), subject to
and in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility and the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco
Facility € Accession Agreement will provide for the payment of certain additional payments to be made to the
Issuer that correspond to the premiums payable to holders of the Notes upon early redemption, as described
below.

_Redemption prior to April 15, 2027_

Except as described below under “—Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes” and “—Redemption
_prior to April 15, 2027 with Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”, at any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the_
occurrence of any Early Redemption Event with respect to the Finco Loan €, the Issuer will redeem an aggregate
principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid in such Early
Redemption Event (not to exceed an amount equal to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date),
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the
Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest

Prior to April 15, 2027, to the extent that during any twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date,
the principal amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid in any one or more Early Redemption Events is greater than an
amount equal to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any)
(any such amount, the “Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Issuer will apply the Excess Early
Redemption Proceeds to redemption of the Notes as described below under “—Redemption prior to April 15,
_2027 with Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”._

_Redemption prior to April 15, 2027 with Excess Early Redemption Proceeds_

_for Changes in Withholding Taxes”, at any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the occurrence of an Early_
Redemption Event, the Issuer will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal
amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid with any Excess Early Redemption Proceeds in such Early Redemption
Event, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, subject to the final paragraph of

redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**_Redemption prior to April 15, 2027 with Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds_**

At any time prior to April 15, 2027, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event with the Net Cash
Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (the “Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Issuer will
redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any)
equal to the principal amount of the Finco Loan € prepaid with any Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds
in such Early Redemption Event, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of
% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the principal amount of the Notes (which, includes Additional Notes, if any), issued under
the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after any such redemption; and

(2) the Issuer makes such redemption not more than 180 days after the consummation of any such Equity
Offering.

**_Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

Upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event effected at any time following the occurrence of an
Issuer Tax Event or an optional prepayment of a Finco Loan € pursuant to Clause 10.4 (Right of Repayment and
_Cancellation in Relation to a Single Lender) of the Credit Facility, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_
not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes, at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and Additional
Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption
or otherwise, if, in the case of an Issuer Tax Event only, the Issuer determines that as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the Laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such Laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction)
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the relevant Payor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay
more than de minimis Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to it (which reasonable measures include, without limitation, the appointment of a new or additional
paying agent in another jurisdiction and not including changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer). The Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum (or, if the relevant jurisdiction was
not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on such date, the date on which such jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction under the Indenture). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with
the procedures described in the Indenture as described under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the

125


-----

foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which
the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice
is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication, delivery or
mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:
(i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement
of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that it cannot
avoid the obligations to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it; and (ii) an
opinion of an independent tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the circumstances
referred to above exist.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the existence of
satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the holders of the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Issuer after such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Open Market Purchases of Credit Facility Loans_**

In the event that any member of the Bank Group makes any offer to purchase or otherwise acquire any
Credit Facility Loans (whether through a tender offer process or other process) at a price below the relevant
prevailing market price for such Credit Facility Loans, and such offer includes all or a portion of the Finco Loan
€ held by the Issuer, the Issuer or any other member of the Bank Group shall make a contemporaneous offer to
purchase some or all of the Notes on substantially similar terms as the offer to purchase the Finco Loan €;
_provided that (1) in no event will holders of such Notes be required to participate in any such offer, (2) the_
consideration offered to holders of the Notes will not be less than the consideration they would have received as
Credit Facility Lenders in connection with such offer to purchase the applicable Credit Facility Loans and
(3) VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5, the Credit Facility Borrower and/or the Issuer shall have confirmed to the
Trustee that such purchases will not result in taxable income for the Issuer, including upon the extinguishment of
Financial Indebtedness in connection therewith, or that VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 and/or the Credit
Facility Borrower will have agreed to pay (directly or indirectly) such income tax payable. Prior to undertaking
any such purchases, one or more members of the Bank Group will enter into arrangements providing for the
payment of any fees and expenses incurred in connection with any such offer.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, validly tender and do not properly withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes, validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third
party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to
redeem all Notes, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other
holder of the Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

Under the Finco Loan €, the Credit Facility Borrower will be obligated to prepay (or procure the
prepayment of) a principal amount of the Finco Loan € in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes tendered in any such tender offer at a price equal to the applicable tender offer or redemption price, and
the Issuer will accept for purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Notes in such tender offer. The
Issuer will apply any such prepayment of the Finco Loan € together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the
Finco Loan € to, but excluding, the date of prepayment and/or redemption, to pay the purchase price of all Notes
accepted for purchase in such tender offer or the redemption price following such tender offer. The Issuer will
promptly notify the Trustee, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 and the Credit Facility Borrower of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes tendered in such tender offer.

**_Selection and Notice_**

In the case of any partial redemption or offer to purchase, selection of the Notes for redemption or purchase
will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, based on the procedures of the
applicable depository) unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange or depositary

126


-----

requirements, although no Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. The Trustee will not be liable for
selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part only,
the notice of redemption or purchase relating to such Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed or purchased. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion
thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.

For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may
be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account
holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

In each case above, any redemption, purchase and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including that the Issuer has received or any Paying Agent has
received from the Issuer sufficient funds to pay the full redemption or purchase price payable to holders of the
Notes on or before the relevant redemption or repurchase date. If such redemption, purchase or notice is subject
to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been, or in the good faith judgment of the Issuer are not likely to be, satisfied by the
redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. For the avoidance
of doubt each series of Notes may be redeemed or purchased either together or separately.

If a redemption or purchase date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day
that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on
such redemption or purchase date if it were a Business Day for the intervening period. If the redemption or
purchase date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name the applicable Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption or purchase.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any successor thereto (a “Payor”) on or with respect to
the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes
(including interest or penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer to timely pay amounts due),
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by Law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the government of the U.K. or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax
purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes (an “Issuer Tax Event”),
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Gross-up Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder, as the case may be, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Gross-up Amounts) equal the amounts which
would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Gross-up Amounts will be payable with respect to:_

(a) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes (other than the mere ownership or holding of such Note or enforcement of rights
thereunder or under the Indenture or the receipt of payments in respect thereof);

127


-----

(b) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder had made a declaration of non-residence
or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that (i) such declaration of
non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by the applicable Law of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a
part of any such Taxes and (ii) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which
such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required under the
applicable Law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that time has been notified
(in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture) by the Payor or any other person through
whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption
is required to be made, but only to the extent the holder is legally entitled to provide such declaration,
claim or filing);

(c) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Gross-up Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);

(d) any Taxes that are payable, otherwise than by withholding, from a payment on the principal of,
redemption price of, premium, if any, or interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(e) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(f) all United States backup withholding taxes;

(g) any withholding or deduction imposed pursuant to (i) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any current or future
regulations or official interpretations thereof, (ii) any treaty, Law, regulation or other official guidance
enacted in any other jurisdiction, or relating to an intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and any other jurisdiction, which (in either case) facilitates the implementation of (i) above or
(iii) any agreement pursuant to the implementation of (i) or (ii) above with the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service, the U.S. government or any governmental or taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

Such Gross-up Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the
holder of the Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Gross-up Amounts by reason of any of clauses
(a) to (h) inclusive above.

The Payor will (1) make any required withholding or deduction and (2) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable Law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies (or,
if certified copies are not available despite reasonable efforts of the Payor, other evidence of payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee) to each holder. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or other evidence) a
certificate stating (a) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (b) the amount of
such withholding Taxes paid per €1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be. Copies of such
documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Trustee by the
holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent if the Notes are
then listed on the Exchange.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable (unless such obligation to pay Gross-up Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such
date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Gross-up Amounts with
respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and each Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate
stating the fact that such Gross-up Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agents or Trustee, as applicable, to pay such Gross-up Amounts to
holders on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further
Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters. The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely
on each such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever mentioned in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes”, in any context: (1) the
payment of principal, (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes, (3) interest, or (4) any other

128


-----

amount payable on or with respect to the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Gross-up
Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Gross-up Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies (including interest and penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer
to timely pay amounts due) which arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any
Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt
of any payments with respect to the Notes, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction in which a Paying Agent is located,
other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the
Collateral or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or resident for tax
purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

In the event the Payor is required to pay Gross-up Amounts, pursuant to the terms of the Expenses
Agreement, VMIH will pay to the Payor an amount in cash equal to such Gross-up Amounts to enable the Payor
to make such payment.

Subject to the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, whenever
the Issuer receives a payment or prepayment under the Finco Loan €, it shall use the funds received solely to
satisfy its obligations (to the extent of the amount owing in respect of such obligations) under the Indenture
(including any premium payable to holders of the Notes).

**_Maintenance of the Existence of the Issuer_**

waiver, or supplement.

**_Information_**

For so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period in which the Issuer is neither subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder,
the Issuer shall furnish to the holders of the Notes and to prospective purchasers of the Notes, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Upon receipt from VMIH or the Credit Facility Agent of any report or other information pursuant to the
terms of or in respect of the Credit Facility, the Issuer will promptly (and in any event, within three Business
Days of receipt) deliver any such report or other information to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all
holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note; provided that to the extent any reports are filed on the SEC’s
website, the Group Reporting Entity’s website or the Ultimate Parent’s website, such reports shall be deemed to
be furnished to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note. In
the event such reports or other information are furnished by or at the direction of VMIH or the Credit Facility
Agent to “public” Credit Facility Lenders via an Internet website or an electronic information provider, the Issuer
shall procure that the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
are granted access to such website or electronic information provider in order to receive such reports or other
information at the same time as other “public” Credit Facility Lenders.

The Issuer, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 or the Credit Facility Borrower will provide to the Trustee, the
holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note (provided, however, that to the
extent any reports are filed on the SEC’s website, the Group Reporting Entity’s website or the Ultimate Parent’s
website, such reports shall be deemed to be furnished to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of
Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note), within 150 days after the end of each fiscal year ending subsequent to the
Issue Date, the audited consolidated statements of financial positions of the Issuer as of the end of the two most
recent fiscal years (or such shorter period as the Issuer has been in existence) and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years (or such shorter period as
the Issuer has been in existence), in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP, IFRS or Local GAAP (such
reporting standard, the “Initial Reporting Standard”), including appropriate footnotes to such financial
statements and a report of the independent auditors on the financial statements. At any time after the Issue Date,
the Issuer may elect to apply for all purposes of the Indenture, in lieu of the Initial Reporting Standard, any of
GAAP, IFRS or Local GAAP (the “New Reporting Standard”) and, upon such election, (1) all financial
statements and reports to be provided, after such election, pursuant to the Indenture shall be prepared on the basis
of the New Reporting Standard as in effect from time to time (including that, upon first reporting its fiscal year
results under the New Reporting Standard, the Issuer shall restate its financial statements on the basis of the New
Reporting Standard for the fiscal year ending immediately prior to the first fiscal year for which financial

131


-----

statements have been prepared on the basis of the New Reporting Standard), and (2) from and after such election,
all ratios, computations, and other determinations based on Initial Reporting Standard contained in the Indenture
shall be computed in conformity with the New Reporting Standard with retroactive effect being given thereto
assuming that such election had been made on the Issue Date.

The Issuer, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 or the Credit Facility Borrower is required to deliver to the
Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default that is, in each case, continuing, the Issuer, VMIH,
VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 or the Credit Facility Borrower is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement within
30 days of becoming aware of such event specifying such Default or Event of Default and the action that is being
taken in respect of such Default or Event of Default. The Issuer, VMIH, VMED O2 UK Holdco 5 or the Credit
Facility Borrower will promptly (or within any time periods prescribed) notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the holders
of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note upon becoming aware of any Default (as
defined in the Credit Facility as then in effect) under the Credit Facility or the Transaction Documents.

**_Impairment of Liens_**

The Issuer shall not take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing any
Lien in the Collateral granted under the Notes Security Documents (it being understood, subject to the proviso
below, that the incurrence of Permitted Issuer Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
any Lien in the Collateral granted under the Notes Security Documents) for the benefit of the Trustee, the
Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Issuer shall not grant to any Person other than the Security
Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other
beneficiaries described in the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (a) the Issuer may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Notes Security Document
for the purposes of incurring Permitted Issuer Liens, (b) the Collateral may be discharged and released in
accordance with the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, (c) the applicable Notes Security Documents may be amended from
time to time to cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect or inconsistency therein, (d) the Issuer may
release any Lien on any properties and assets constituting Collateral under the Notes Security Documents,
_provided that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent re-taking of a Lien of at least equivalent_
priority over the same properties and assets securing the Notes, and (e) the Issuer may make any other change
that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect. For any amendments,
modifications or replacements of any Notes Security Documents or Liens not contemplated in clauses (a) to (e)
above, the Issuer or the relevant Grantor shall contemporaneously with any such action deliver to the Trustee and
the Security Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
and the Security Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer or the
relevant Grantor (as applicable) after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, (ii) a certificate from the responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer or the relevant Grantor (acting in good faith) which confirms the solvency of the
person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Notes Security Documents, as applicable, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications from the Issuer) consent to any
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the holders of the Notes.

**Collateral Sharing Agreement; Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement**

The Trustee will become party to the Collateral Sharing Agreement on the Issue Date, and each holder of a
Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have (i) authorized and directed the Trustee and Security
Trustee to enter into the Collateral Sharing Agreement, (ii) agreed to be bound by all the terms and provisions of
the Collateral Sharing Agreement applicable to such holder and (iii) irrevocably appointed and directed each of

132


-----

the Trustee and the Security Trustee to act on its behalf and to perform the duties and exercise the rights and
powers that are specifically given to them under the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the incurrence by the Issuer
of any Financial Indebtedness that is permitted to share the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted
Issuer Liens, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such Financial
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) a collateral sharing agreement, including an accession to
or a restatement, amendment or other modification of an existing collateral sharing agreement (including an
amendment, restatement or modification of the Collateral Sharing Agreement) (an “Additional Collateral
**Sharing Agreement”), on substantially the same terms (other than, prior to a CSA Enforcement Event (as**
defined below), with respect to rights to provide notice or instructions or other administrative matters) as the
Collateral Sharing Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes) including with
respect to the subordination, payment blockage, priority and release of any Lien in respect of the Collateral or
other terms which become customary for similar agreements; provided that such Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Trustee or adversely affect the
personal rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Trustee under the Indenture or the
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the
Security Trustee will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement
and/or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect
or inconsistency therein; (ii) add other parties (such as representatives of new issuances of Financial
Indebtedness) thereto; (iii) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (iv) make provision for equal
and ratable grants of Liens on the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Issuer
Liens; (v) make any other change to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or such Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement to provide for additional Financial Indebtedness or other obligations that are permitted by the terms
of the Indenture to be incurred and secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Liens
securing the Notes; (vi) amend the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; (vii) implement any transaction in connection with the renewal,
extension, refinancing, replacement or increase of any Financial Indebtedness that is not prohibited by the
Indenture; or (viii) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the
Notes in any material respect; provided that no such changes shall be permitted to the extent they affect the
ranking of any Note, enforcement of Liens over the Collateral, the application of proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral or the release of any Liens over the Collateral in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
of the holders of the Notes in any material respect except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement immediately prior to such change. The
Issuer will not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional Collateral sharing Agreement, without the consent of the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, except as described above or
otherwise permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Indenture and the Notes”, and
the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement.

Each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(a) appointed, authorized and directed the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee from time to time to give effect to
such provisions;

(b) authorized and directed each of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee from time to time to become a party
to any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement and any document giving effect to such amendments to the
Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement;

(c) agreed to be bound by such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement
and any document giving effect to such amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement; and

(d) irrevocably appointed and directed the Trustee and the Security Trustee to act on its behalf from time to
time to enter into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement and any document giving effect to such amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement,

133


-----

in each case, without the need for the consent of the holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or an Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders of the Notes to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the Indenture.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

**_Events of Default_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note when due, which has continued for
30 days;

(2) default for one Business Day in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on any Note;

(3) failure by the Issuer to comply with Clauses (4), (5), (6) or (10) under the captions “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer” or the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—_
_Maintenance of the Existence of the Issuer” or “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under_
_Credit Facility Loan Documents”;_

(4) failure by the Issuer for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture
(other than those described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) or the Notes; provided that the Issuer shall have
90 days after receipt of such notice to remedy, or receive a waiver for, any failure to comply with the
obligations to file annual reports or provide other reports or information in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Information” so long as the Issuer is attempting to cure such failure as promptly as
reasonably practicable;

(5) breach by the Issuer of any material representation or warranty in any Notes Security Document to which it
is a party and such breach is not remedied within 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, the repudiation by the
Issuer of any of its obligations under any Notes Security Document to which it is a party or the
unenforceability for any reason against the Issuer of any Notes Security Document to which it is a party;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Issuer;

(7) (a) failure by any party thereto for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in the
Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement or the Finco Facility € Fee Letter in any
material respect or (b) the repudiation by any party thereto of any of its obligations under any of the Finco
Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement or the Finco Facility € Fee Letter, the
unenforceability for any reason against any party thereto of the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the
Expenses Agreement or the Finco Facility € Fee Letter or any breach by any party thereto of any material
representation or warranty in the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement or the Finco
Facility € Fee Letter; or

(8) (a) the occurrence of a VMED O2 Event of Default that is continuing or (b) any breach by the Credit
Facility Borrower of any material representation or warranty or any material agreement in the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement and such breach is not remedied within 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the
Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, as
applicable.

For purposes of clause (8) above, “VMED O2 Facility Event of Default” means an “Event of Default” as
defined in the Credit Facility (including in respect of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement) as then in effect.

**_Remedies_**

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional

134


-----

Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of
Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Any notice of
Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or
Event of Default or notice of acceleration, or to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event
of Default, may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two
years prior to such notice or instruction. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may waive all past defaults (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium,
interest or Additional Amounts) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences
if (a) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, (b) all
existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have
been cured or waived and (c) the Issuer has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the
Trustee for its reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances.

Following acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, the
Lien over the Collateral will become enforceable, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement (a “CSA Enforcement Event”). Following
a CSA Enforcement Event under the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement, pursuant to the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Credit Facility Borrower will consent to
any assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations (in whole or in part) of the Finco Loan €,
including any subsequent assignment, transfer or novation of the Finco Loan €, subject to minimum transfer
amount €100,000 principal amount, and other requirements of a Credit Facility Lender under the Credit Facility.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, in
case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of
the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee indemnity or security
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts (if any) when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 50% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee and/or the Security Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder has offered the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory
to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt
of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
and/or the Security Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as
applicable, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will
provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use under the circumstances in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with Law, the
Indenture, the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of Notes or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or
indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not
taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee,
the Trustee must give notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the

135


-----

payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes.

With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists”, “is continuing” or similar expressions
with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or
waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a
specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the
applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the
terms of the Indenture or any Transaction Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be
cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken
under the Indenture and the Transaction Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or
otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture
and the Transaction Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured
**Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any**
action by any person, which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default
not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured
Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial
**Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph:**

(a) in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of the second sentence of this paragraph, if an Officer
of the Issuer had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and
was continuing; or

(b) if the Trustee shall have declared all the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to the provisions
described under “Events of Default” prior to the date such Initial Default would have been deemed to be
cured under this paragraph.

For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Issuer,
(i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such
individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of diligence and care as
would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a
failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without
any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Information”, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to
any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by
such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding any provision in the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or otherwise to the contrary, the obligations of the Issuer to the Trustee, the Security Trustee,
any Registrar, any Paying Agent and the holders of the Notes under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes
Security Documents shall be limited to the proceeds of the realization of the Collateral once the proceeds have
been applied in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement. Having realized all the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes, the
Notes Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement and distributed the net proceeds thereof in
accordance with the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement, none of the Trustee, the Security Trustee,
any Registrar, any Paying Agent and the holders of the Notes may take any further steps to recover any sum still
unpaid in respect of the Notes, the Indenture or any of the Notes Security Documents or otherwise and all claims
against the Issuer in respect of any such sum due but still unpaid shall be extinguished.

**Non-Petition**

Each of the Trustee, the Security Trustee, any Registrar, any Paying Agent and each holder of Notes will
agree that its rights against the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement will be limited to the extent that it will not take any action or proceedings against
the Issuer to recover any amounts due and payable by the Issuer to it thereunder except as expressly permitted by
the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

136


-----

Each of the Trustee, the Security Trustee, any Registrar, any Paying Agent and each holder of Notes will further
agree that it will not, and in the case of a holder of Notes will not request that the Trustee or the Security Trustee
on its behalf, petition a court for, or take any other action or commence any proceedings for, the liquidation or
winding-up of the Issuer or any other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or stockholder of the Issuer, any of their respective
parent companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of a Note, by accepting a Note,
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the United States federal securities
Laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

**_To the Credit Facility or the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement_**

In the event that the Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)
(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter, other than the Credit Facility
Amendments, arising from time to time under the Credit Facility or under the Finco Facility € Accession
Agreement in which all Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise
consent) (a “Credit Facility Decision”), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the
Notes (each, a “Noteholder Consent”) with respect to such Credit Facility Decision in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture described above under “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under
_Credit Facility Loan Documents”. Upon the expiration of the applicable consent period, the Issuer will inform_
the Credit Facility Agent promptly in writing (and in no event more than one Business Day following such
expiration) of the results of the Noteholder Consent.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Credit Facility Lenders are not entitled to split their votes when
voting on a proposed consent, waiver, amendment or other determination. The following voting mechanic is
designed to achieve the same practical effect as allowing a Credit Facility Lender to split its vote (subject to the
provisions set forth below) under the Credit Facility.

Under the terms of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Credit Facility Agent will be authorized
to apply the Noteholder Consent to the Credit Facility Decision, at the direction of the Issuer or Trustee, as
follows:

(OLC+BC+ABC+OBC)
= Threshold Amount
OL

Where:

“OLC” = aggregate Commitments consenting (other than any Commitments of the Issuer and any other
SPV Issuer) to such Credit Facility Decision;

“BC” = aggregate principal amount of Notes consenting; provided that where at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Notes that respond to such solicitation provide consent, BC will be deemed to
equal the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that with respect to any
Credit Facility Decision on any Credit Facility Amendments, BC will be deemed to equal the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that for purposes of the calculation of BC, the principal
amount of the Notes will be converted into sterling at the Facility Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange (as defined in
the Credit Facility) as of the Issue Date;

“ABC” = aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes consenting; provided that where at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes that respond to such
solicitation provide consent, ABC will be deemed equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s Other
SPV Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that where two or more series of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes
vote as a single class under an indenture, they will constitute a single series for purposes of this definition;

137


-----

“OBC” = aggregate principal amount of SPV Notes issued by all SPV Issuers (other than any SPV Notes
issued by the Issuer) consenting; provided that, with respect to each SPV Issuer (other than the Issuer), where at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of SPV Notes issued by such SPV Issuer that respond to such
solicitation provide consent, OBC with respect to such SPV Issuer will be deemed to equal the aggregate
principal amount of the SPV Notes then outstanding and issued by such SPV Issuer; provided, further, that where
two or more series of such SPV Issuer’s SPV Notes vote as a single class under an indenture, they will constitute
a single series for purposes of this definition;

“OL” = aggregate Commitments under the Credit Facility; and

“Commitments” means the aggregate undrawn Commitments (as defined in the Credit Facility) and
participations in outstanding Advances (as defined in the Credit Facility) under the Credit Facility; provided that,
solely for the purposes of determining whether any amendment or waiver of any term of the Credit Facility has
been approved by the relevant Credit Facility Lenders, the amount of the Advances and undrawn Commitments
shall be reduced by the amount of the Advances and undrawn Commitments of any Credit Facility Lender that
has not responded to such request for amendment or waiver within 10 Business Days after the date such request
has been received by it (or within such other period as the Credit Facility Agent and VMIH shall specify).

In connection with any vote or consent, the Issuer will, on or prior to the day that is 10 Business Days after
the date such request has been notified to the relevant Credit Facility Lenders by the Credit Facility Agent,
instruct the Credit Facility Agent to vote or consent in accordance with the voting mechanic described above,
request further information from the Credit Facility Agent or notify the Credit Facility Agent that it is actively
reviewing such request with a view to making such decision.

To the extent the Threshold Amount (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to the required
percentage of Credit Facility Lender consents with respect to any Credit Facility Decision, the entire amount of
Finco Loan € will be voted in favor of the matter that is the subject of such Credit Facility Decision. To the
extent the Threshold Amount is less than the required percentage of Credit Facility Lender consents with respect
to any Credit Facility Decision, the entire amount of Finco Loan € will be voted against the matter that is the
subject of such Credit Facility Decision.

Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph, any provision or term of the Finco Facility
€ Accession Agreement and the Credit Facility applicable only to the Finco Loan € or to a several right of the
Issuer, as Credit Facility Lender, may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default
or Event of Default in respect of, or compliance with, any such provision or term may be waived with the consent
of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without

_provided that any provision or term of the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement or the Credit Facility applicable_
only to Finco Loan € may be amended or supplemented with the consent of holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, the Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Finco Facility € Accession

provision of the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the

the Expenses Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security
Document, the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral

Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

determination;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any
Note;

(ii) reduce the premium payable upon repurchase of any Note or change the time at which any Note is to be
repurchased as described under “Redemption and Repurchase” at any time after the obligation to repurchase
has arisen;

(5) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Note (except to the extent that the
currency stated in the Notes has been succeeded or replaced pursuant to applicable Law);

(6) impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of, premium, if any, principal of or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for
the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s Notes; or

(7) make any change in these amendment or waiver provisions.

In addition, without the consent of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, no
amendment or supplement may modify any Notes Security Document or the provisions in the Indenture dealing
with the Notes Security Documents or application of trust moneys in any manner, taken as a whole, materially
adverse to the holders of the Notes or otherwise release all or substantially all of the Collateral except in
accordance with the terms of the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement or as otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the Finco
Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement,
the Finco Facility € Fee Letter and the Expenses Agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended));

(3) to add guarantees with respect to, or secure, the Notes (including, without limitation, to grant any security or
supplemental security);

(4) to add to the covenants of the Issuer or any other Person or surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Security Documents;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the Notes or that
does not adversely affect the rights of any such holder in any material respect;

139


-----

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Notes Security
Document or any other Transaction Document to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the
extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Notes Security Document or
any other Transaction Document;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to the extent necessary to allow the Issuer to participate on the same terms as other Credit Facility Lenders
in an offer to purchase or otherwise acquire Credit Facility Loans by any member of the Bank Group made
in compliance with the requirements set out under “—Open Market Purchases of Credit Facility Loans”;

(9) to give effect to Permitted Issuer Liens;

(10) to release any Lien on the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes Security
Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement;

(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture, the Notes Security
Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and/or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement of a
successor Trustee or Security Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes; provided that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being
transferred in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable securities Law and (ii) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the Notes; provided that such reduction would
not result in a breach of applicable securities Laws or in a requirement to produce a prospectus or otherwise
register the Notes with any regulatory authority in connection with any investment therein or resale thereof;

(14) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary; or

(15) to the extent reasonably necessary to give effect to the Transactions.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence
as it deems appropriate, including an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

A consent to any amendment or waiver by any holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange
and the guidelines of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such amendment,
supplement and waiver.

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer or payment of a consent fee to holders of the
Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the Finco Facility € Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing
Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Finco Facility € Fee Letter and the Expenses
Agreement will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or
paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar, as applicable, for cancellation; or

(b) (i) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation
(A) have become due and payable by reason of the mailing or delivery of a notice of redemption or
otherwise or (B) will become due and payable within one year and (ii) the Issuer or a third party acting
on behalf of the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash, Cash Equivalents, European Government

140


-----

Obligations or a combination thereof, denominated in euro, in amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Financial Indebtedness on
the Notes not delivered to the Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation for principal,
premium and Additional Amounts (if any) and accrued interest to, but excluding, the date of maturity
or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or a third party acting on behalf of the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other amounts
payable by it under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in
each case, stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

In addition, if:

(1) part of the Notes (the “Called Notes”) have become irrevocably due and payable by reason of the mailing or
delivery of an unconditional notice of redemption or otherwise;

(2) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely
for the benefit of the holders of such Called Notes, cash, Cash Equivalents, European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in euro, in amounts as will be sufficient,
without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Financial Indebtedness
on such Called Notes for principal, premium and Additional Amounts (if any) and accrued interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of such Called Notes on the redemption date,

then such Called Notes will not constitute Financial Indebtedness under the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer
must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that all
conditions precedent to such Called Notes not constituting Financial Indebtedness have been satisfied.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture is euro.
Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) by
the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from
the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the euro, which the recipient is able to
purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery
(or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If
that euro amount, is less than the euro amount, expressed to be due to the recipient under the Indenture or any
Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Issuer
will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for such recipient to certify that it would have
suffered a loss had an actual purchase of euro, been made with the amount so received in that other currency on
the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of euros, on such date had not been practicable, on the first date
on which it would have been practicable). These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation
from the other obligations of the Issuer, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other
judgment or order.

**Listing**

The Issuer is expected to make an application to list the Notes on the Exchange within a reasonable period
after the Issue Date and will maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer
can no longer maintain such listing or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing (for the
avoidance of doubt, preparation of financial statements in accordance with any accounting standard other than

141


-----

the standard pursuant to which the Issuer then prepares its financial statements shall be deemed unduly
burdensome), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Exchange; provided, further, that the
Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain (1) the listing of the Notes on another recognised
stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European
Union or the U.K.) provided such stock exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of
the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom (the “ITA”) for the purposes of Section 987 of the ITA, or
(2) the admission to trading on a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a “regulated recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of Section 987 of the ITA. There can be no assurance that the application to list
the Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this
listing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing
(whether on the Exchange or on another recognised stock exchange for high yield issuers) or admission to trading
on a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a “regulated recognised stock exchange” if such listing or
admission to trading is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest
payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions. However, if it acquires any conflicting
interest, as such term is used in the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, it must eliminate such conflict
within 90 days or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in
the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security
and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. It may not be possible for the Trustee to
take certain actions in relation to the Notes and accordingly in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to
take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or an indemnity to it.

**Notices**

So long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange, any notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be
published to the extent and as required by the rules of the Exchange. In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to
Euroclear and/or Clearstream. Additionally, in the event the Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes,
notices will be sent, by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s
address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar. If publication as provided above is not
practicable, notice will be given in such other manner, and shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as
the Trustee may approve. If and so long as such Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, notices will
also be given in accordance with any applicable requirements of such securities exchange. Notices given by
publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes will each be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York. The Credit Facility, the Finco Facility € Accession Agreement, the Finco Facility € Deed of
Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Expenses Agreement, the Finco Facility € Fee Letter and
certain Notes Security Documents will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will irrevocably appoint Virgin Media, as its agent for service of
process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture and the Notes, as the case may be, brought
in any federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and that each of the
parties submit to the jurisdiction thereof. If, for any reason Virgin Media is unable to serve in such capacity, the
Issuer shall appoint another agent.

142

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the assets of the Issuer are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States
against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment
of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

approximately equal to the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes and of a maturity most nearly
equal to April 15, 2027; provided, however, that, if the period from such redemption date to April 15, 2027

**BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

**General**

The Notes offered hereby are denominated in euro.

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or
more permanent notes in registered, global form, without interest coupons (the “Regulation S Global Notes”).
The Regulation S Global Note will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers pursuant to
Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form, without interest coupons
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The book-entry interests in the Global Notes will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the U.S., may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge book-entry interests. In
addition, while the Notes are in global form, “holders” of book-entry interests will not be considered the owners
of Notes for any purpose. Only the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note. So long
as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees) will be
considered the holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own book-entry interests in order to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A book-entry interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S book-entry interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A book-entry interests, the “book-entry interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-entry interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be issued
in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Neither we nor the Trustee under the Indenture nor any of our respective agents will have any responsibility
or be liable for any aspect of the records in relation to the book-entry interests.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the book-entry interests in such Global Note, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such book-entry interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof), subject to any applicable withholding taxes. We understand that under existing practices of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or by lot or on any other basis that they deem fair and appropriate; provided that no book-entry
interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by us to a paying agent. The paying agent will, in
turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee and Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their procedures.

152


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the
Trustee or any of our respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
or payments made on account of a book-entry interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to a book-entry
interest or payments made on account of a book-entry interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of book-entry interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street
name”.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global
Notes will be paid in euro through Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.
However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve their right, subject to
certain restrictions, to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) in
certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of book-entry interests will receive definitive notes in registered
form (“Definitive Registered Notes”):

    - if Euroclear and/or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days;

    - in whole, but not in part, if the Issuer, Euroclear and/ or Clearstream so request following an Event of
Default under (and as defined in) the Indenture; or

    - if the owner of a book-entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream or the Issuer following an Event of Default under (and as defined in) the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a book-entry interest described in the
immediately preceding clause, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued
Definitive Registered Notes to all owners of book-entry interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of book-entry interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the paying agents and the registrar shall treat the registered holder of any Definitive
Registered Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as
such. Ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time in
the register maintained by the Registrar on behalf of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the Notes.

153


-----

The Issuer shall not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the bookentry interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Transfers**

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-entry interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions”.

During the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same
currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a
certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is both a QIB in reliance on Rule 144A who is also a Qualified Purchaser
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(51) of, and Rules 2a51-1, 2a51-2 and 2a51-3 under the Investment Company
Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the
states of the United States and any other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt
by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, book-entry interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”.

Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a
book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note,
and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a book-entry interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Definitive Registered
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All book-entry interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each Clearing System are controlled by that Clearing System and
may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

154


-----

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only
through Euroclear or Clearstream systems.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Issuer will make an application to have the Notes admitted to listing on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange. We expect that any permitted secondary market trading activity in the Notes will
also be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to
the Global Notes, cross-market transfers in interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures.

The book-entry interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date. Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the
foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the
Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-entry interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-entry interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The book-entry interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition,
ownership, and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussion under
“—FATCA” and “—U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting”. This description only applies to
Notes held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth
below, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax
rules, such as:

    - banks or other financial institutions;

    - insurance companies;

    - real estate investment trusts, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts;

    - regulated investment companies;

    - grantor trusts;

    - tax-exempt organizations;

    - persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities;

    - dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

    - U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

    - certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States;

    - U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or

    - U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion
or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Moreover, this description does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or any alternative minimum
tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes and does not address the 3.8%
Medicare tax on net investment income that may also apply to certain U.S. Holders’ capital gains and interest in
respect of the Notes or rules requiring persons that use the accrual method of accounting to include certain
amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. This
description does not address U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders of the senior secured debt of the Issuer
that will be refinanced pursuant to the Refinancing Transaction and holders that do not acquire the Notes as part
of the initial distribution at their initial issue price (generally, the first price to the public at which a substantial
amount of the Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers). Each prospective
purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax
consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes.

This description is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury
**Regulations”), administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date**
hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) or differing interpretations,
which could affect the tax considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel or ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No
assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from
any of the tax considerations discussed below.

For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal
income tax purposes is:

    - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust (1) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
(2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the
substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control.

156


-----

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to
its consequences.

Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of Notes should consult their own tax advisors
concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to their particular situations as well as any
considerations arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**Treatment of the Notes as Debt**

The Issuer expects and, to the extent required, intends to take the position that the Notes should be treated as
debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; however no assurances can be given that the Issuer’s
position will not be successfully challenged by the IRS. If successfully challenged by the IRS that the Notes are
treated as equity, U.S. Holders would be treated as holding equity in the Issuer. If the Notes are treated as equity
in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders would likely be subject to adverse tax
consequences, including those under the passive foreign investment company rules pursuant to which (i) all or a
portion of any gain on disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain, (ii) a
deferred interest charge would apply to such gain and on certain distributions on the Notes and (iii) a U.S. Holder
would be required to comply with certain reporting requirements.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their
particular situations. The discussion below assumes that the Notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

**Redemptions and Additional Amounts**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may be obligated
to make payments in excess of stated interest and the principal amount of the Notes (“Additional Amounts”) or
redeem the Notes in advance of their expected maturity at a premium (see “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”). The Issuer believes, and intends to take the_
position if required, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments in light of,
among other things, the possibility of such payments or redemptions. This position is based in part on
assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, of such payments or redemptions.
Assuming such position is respected, any payments of Additional Amounts should be taxable as additional
ordinary income when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and any premium paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any repurchase or redemption
would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition by a U.S.
_Holder”. The IRS may, however, take a position contrary to the position described above, which could affect the_
amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes. A U.S. Holder that desires to
take the position that the Notes are subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules should consult with
its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such position as required by applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules
and the consequences thereof. This discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest**

Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as a “qualified stated interest”. Payments of
qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any Additional Amounts and without reduction for any taxes
withheld) generally will be includable in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the
time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or other property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as
constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate.

The stated interest paid in euro (including the amount of any withholding tax thereon) will be included in a
U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro, regardless of whether the
euro is converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will

157


-----

determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S.
Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may
have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro received. Generally, a U.S.
Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest
income using the average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year).

Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued
interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of
the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the
accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an
interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in
translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S.
Holder will be an amount equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment
(determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual
period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined
above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be
ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign
currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be
the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss.

Interest, including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with
respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation
on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific
“baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”. Any
non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. The U.S. Treasury Regulations impose various limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to
claim foreign tax credit. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign
tax credits.

**Original Issue Discount**

A Note will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the stated principal
amount of the Note exceeds its issue price by 1/4 of 1% of the Note’s stated principal amount multiplied by the
number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity.

If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the
receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The
amount of OID a U.S. Holder should include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note
for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the Note is held by such U.S.
Holder. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual
period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the
Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or
interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of
OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price”
of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant
yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular
accrual period) and (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted
issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the
amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the Note that were not
qualified stated interest.

Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of
OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount
payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the
beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to
include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with

158


-----

respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an
election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor.

U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and
yield to maturity by contacting the Directors, 500 Brook Drive, Reading RG2 6UU, United Kingdom.

Any OID on a Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S.
dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of an amount
attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such Note or otherwise), a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as stated
interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or
loss rules.

The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding
the application of these rules to their particular situations.

**Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition by a U.S. Holder**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition (other than any amount received in respect of accrued and unpaid stated
interest which will be subject to tax in the manner described above in “—Payments and Accruals of Stated
_Interest” to the extent not previously included in income), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note._

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of
any OID previously included in income. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with euro, the U.S. dollar cost of the
Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot
rate of exchange on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a Note generally will be the U.S.
dollar value of the amount received on the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that
date. However, if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so
elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on
the Note by translating the amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
purchase or disposition, as applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the
purchase and disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder
generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary
income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such
foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro
purchase price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note. The
realization of any foreign currency gain or loss, including foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts
attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest and any OID, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or
loss realized on the disposition of a Note.

**Exchange of Amounts in Other than U.S. Dollars**

If a U.S. Holder receives euro as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note, such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the euro will equal the U.S. dollar value when the euro are
received. If a U.S. Holder purchased a Note with previously owned non-U.S. currency, gain or loss on such
currency will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in

159


-----

such currency and the spot rate on the date of purchase of the Note. Any such gain or loss generally will be
treated as ordinary income or loss from sources within the United States provided that the residence of the U.S.
Holder is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rule governing foreign currency transactions.

**Reportable Transaction Reporting**

Under certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, U.S. Holders that participate in “reportable transactions” (as
defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) must attach to their U.S. federal income tax returns a disclosure
statement on IRS Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency
exchange loss from the Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the U.S.
Treasury Regulations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to file IRS
Form 8886 with respect to the ownership or disposition of the Notes, or any related transaction, including without
limitation, the disposition of any non-U.S. currency received as interest or as proceeds from the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

The Issuer may issue “Additional Notes” (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”). In some cases, these
Additional Notes may not be fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even if they
are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as either series of original Notes, which may affect the
market value of the original Notes even if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the
original Notes.

**U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting**

Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments of principal of,
and interest and accruals of OID, if any, on, an obligation and to proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of an obligation, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor will be required to withhold backup
withholding tax on payments made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman or certain of
their affiliates, on a Note to, or from gross proceeds of the sale or disposition of a Note paid to, a U.S. Holder if
the U.S. Holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or
establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any
required information in a timely manner.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes as “specified
foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held
in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder
(commonly referred to as “FATCA”) generally imposes withholding at a rate of 30% on payments of interest
made to any foreign entity on debt obligations generating U.S. source interest or certain other debt obligations
generating non-U.S. source interest including “foreign passthru payments” made by a foreign financial
institution, unless the foreign financial institution complies with certain reporting rules under FATCA or
otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Currently, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not defined and it is
unclear whether or to what extent payments on the Notes would be considered foreign passthru payments,
assuming the issuer would be considered a foreign financial institution. If and when such regulations are issued,
the Notes will be grandfathered and FATCA withholding should not apply to the Notes to the extent otherwise
applicable. If, however, the Notes are modified more than six months after the date final regulations defining a
foreign passthru payment are published FATCA withholding may apply (effective beginning two years from
such date of publication), and holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any
Additional Amounts to compensate them for any such withholding. In addition, if Additional Notes are issued
after the expiration of the grandfathering period and have the same international securities identification number
(the “ISIN”), common code and/or CUSIP as the Notes issued hereby, then withholding agents may treat all

160


-----

notes bearing the same ISIN, common code and/or CUSIP number, including any Notes issued hereby, as subject
to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a refund in
such circumstances. The intergovernmental agreement between the U.K. and the United States modifies the
requirements in this paragraph and an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign
country where a holder or intermediary is located may further modify such requirements. Prospective holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the
Notes.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating**
**to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should**
**consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**CERTAIN MATERIAL UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general guide to certain U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes based on current
U.K. law and published practice of HM Revenue & Customs (which may not be binding on HM Revenue &
Customs), both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes. In particular, it does not address the U.K.
tax consequences of the sale, exchange, redemption, or other disposal of the Notes. Prospective investors should
consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible U.K. or other tax consequences of buying,
holding or selling any Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile,
including the effect of any state or local tax laws. It applies only to persons who are the absolute beneficial
owners of Notes and some aspects do not apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities.
Prospective investors who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the U.K. or who are in any doubt as
to their tax position should consult their own professional advisors.

The references to “interest” in this section “Certain Material United Kingdom Tax Considerations” mean
“interest” as understood in U.K. tax law which may include amounts not described as interest herein, such as any
premium on redemption. Those statements do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest”
which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any
related documentation.

**Payment of Interest**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of section 987 of the Income Tax Act
2007 (the “2007 Act”), as long as they are and continue to be listed on a “recognized stock exchange” within the
meaning of section 1005 of the 2007 Act. The International Stock Exchange is such a “recognized stock
exchange”. The Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed on The International Stock
Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in the EEA and the U.K.
Provided that this condition remains satisfied, payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction
or withholding for or on account of U.K. tax.

In the event that the Notes are not or cease to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, payments of interest
must be made under deduction of U.K. income tax at the basic rate, currently 20%, subject to any direction to the
contrary by HM Revenue & Customs under an applicable double taxation treaty, unless payments are made to
some categories of recipients, including companies which the Issuer reasonably believes are subject to U.K.
corporation tax in respect of the payment of interest.

Interest and any discount on the Notes may be subject to income tax by direct assessment even where paid
without deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K. income tax. Interest and any discount on the Notes
received without deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K. tax will not generally be chargeable to U.K.
tax in the hands of a holder of Notes who is not resident for tax purposes in the U.K. (other than in the case of
certain trustees) unless that holder of Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a U.K.
branch or agency, or for holders of Notes who are companies through a U.K. permanent establishment, in
connection with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable. There are exemptions from
U.K. tax for interest received through certain categories of agent, such as some brokers and investment managers.
The provisions of an applicable double tax treaty may be relevant to such a holder of Notes.

The provisions relating to additional payments referred to under “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes” would not apply if HM Revenue & Customs sought to assess the person entitled to the interest directly to_
U.K. income tax. Exemption from or reduction of U.K. tax liability might be available under an applicable
double taxation treaty.

**Provision of Information**

HM Revenue & Customs have powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including
in relation to issues of and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest and other
payments derived from the Notes. This may include the value of the Notes, details of the beneficial owners of the
Notes, of the person for whom the Notes are held and of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes
are or may be paid. Information may be obtained from a range of persons including persons who effect or are a
party to such transactions on behalf of others, registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered
holders of the Notes, persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes and

162


-----

persons by or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited. Information obtained
by HM Revenue & Customs may, in certain circumstances, be exchanged by HM Revenue & Customs with the
tax authorities of other jurisdictions.

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)**

No U.K. stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Notes or on a transfer of the Notes provided that
(i) the interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the
capital, and (ii) any right on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the
Notes is reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of
capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.

**CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain
fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment
funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities
whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those
persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority
or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is
generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject
to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification
and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain
persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under Section 3(14) of ERISA or “disqualified persons” under
Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction
may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have
to be rescinded.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise
if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the
Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Moreover, the
acquisition or holding of the Notes or other indebtedness issued by the Issuer by or on behalf of a party in interest
or disqualified person with respect to a Plan that owns or acquires an equity interest in the Issuer also could give
rise to a prohibited transaction. Even if none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in
interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has
an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary.
Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire
a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset
managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60
(relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to
transactions effected by in-house asset managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is
also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of
the Code to a person that is a party in interest solely by reason of being a service provider to a Plan investing in
the Notes for adequate consideration or an affiliate of such service provider, provided such service provider or
affiliate is not a fiduciary with respect to the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such
fiduciary (the “Service **Provider** **Exemption”).** “Adequate consideration” (within the meaning of
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) means fair market as determined in good
faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to regulations to be promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However,
there can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider Exemption or any
other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving
the Notes.

“Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions
of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local,
non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the
Code (“Similar Laws”).

The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited
transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be

164


-----

available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of
an applicable exemption.

Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Labor at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulation”), the assets of an entity that is neither a
publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the U.S. Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) will be deemed to constitute “plan assets”
for the purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if a “Benefit Plan Investor” (as defined below) acquires
an “equity interest” in the entity and none of the exceptions contained in the Plan Asset Regulation is applicable.
An equity interest is defined under the Plan Asset Regulation as an interest other than an instrument which is
treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. Under the
exceptions in the Plan Asset Regulation, an entity will not be deemed to hold plan assets if (i) participation in the
entity by Benefit Plan Investors is not “significant” (e.g., Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25% of the total
value of each class of equity interest in the entity), or (ii) the entity is an operating company, including a “venture
capital operating company” or “real estate operating company”.

EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE
DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE THAT AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN (1) EITHER
(A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS THIS NOTE
OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF OF) (I) AN
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE
PROVISIONS OF PART 4 OF SUBTITLE B OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT
ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE APPLIES,
OR (III) AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE “PLAN ASSETS” (WITHIN THE
MEANING OF 29 C.F.R. SECTION 2510.3-101, AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 3(42) OF ERISA) BY
REASON OF ANY SUCH PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN SUCH ENTITY (EACH OF (I), (II) AND (III), A
“BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR”) OR (IV) A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN WHICH
IS SUBJECT TO ANY SIMILAR LAWS, AND NO PART OF THE ASSETS TO BE USED BY IT TO
ACQUIRE OR HOLD SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN CONSTITUTES THE ASSETS OF ANY
BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR ANY SUCH GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, OR
(B) ITS ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN
DOES NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT
PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA AND/OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE
(OR, IN THE CASE OF A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH, OR NON-U.S. PLAN, A NON-EXEMPT
VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS); AND (2) NONE OF THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,
THE TRUSTEE, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES IS A “FIDUCIARY” (WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR, WITH RESPECT TO A
GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, ANY DEFINITION OF “FIDUCIARY” UNDER
SIMILAR LAWS) WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRER OR TRANSFEREE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
PURCHASE OR HOLDING OF THE NOTE, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY EXERCISE BY THE ISSUER, THE
INITIAL PURCHASERS, THE TRUSTEE OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OF ANY
RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE, AND NO ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER, THE
INITIAL PURCHASERS, THE TRUSTEE OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES CONSTITUTES
“INVESTMENT ADVICE” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975
OF THE CODE) IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTE.

THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THE TRUSTEE, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES, SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONCLUSIVELY RELY UPON THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY
OF THE FOREGOING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY ACQUIRERS AND
TRANSFEREES OF ANY NOTES (OR INTERESTS THEREIN) WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY.

The transfer of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is
subject to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or
any of their respective affiliates, that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by such plans generally or any particular such plan; that the Investor-Based Exemptions or the
Service Provider Exemption described above, or any other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such
an investment by such plans in general or any particular such plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for
such plans generally or any particular such plan.

The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this offering memorandum, is, of
necessity, general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore,
the matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which
may have retroactive application and effect.

Any Plan or employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and any fiduciary
thereof, proposing to participate in the offers and acquire the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its
legal advisors regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable
requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been registered and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other
applicable securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as such terms are defined under the
U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered
by this offering memorandum only (a) to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers, in reliance on the exemption
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside the United
States to persons other than U.S. persons as defined in Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act in an offshore
transaction in reliance upon Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes (a “purchaser”), by its acceptance of this offering memorandum, will be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, the Notes are being offered for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities
laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S, and none of the Notes may be offered,
sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption from such laws or in a
transaction not subject to such laws, and in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
forth in paragraph (5) below.

(2) The purchaser acknowledges that this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC rules
that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of securities. The purchaser will,
and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser from it of those Notes of
the resale restrictions referred to herein.

(3) The purchaser is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of ours, the purchaser is not acting on our
behalf and is either:

(a) a QIB and a Qualified Purchaser, and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in
reliance on Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of
another QIB that is also a Qualified Purchaser; or

(b) not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing the Notes for the account or benefit of a U.S. person)
within the meaning of Regulation S, and is purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

Furthermore, unless the purchaser is not a U.S. person purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S as set forth in clause (b) of this paragraph (3), the purchaser
acknowledges that it will hold and transfer at least the minimum denomination of the Notes and that:
(i) it is not a broker-dealer who owns and invests on a discretionary basis less than $25,000,000 in
securities of unaffiliated issuers; (ii) it is not a participant-directed employee plan, such as a 401(k)
plan, or a trust holding the assets of such a plan; (iii) it was not formed, reformed or recapitalized for
the specific purpose of investing in the Notes and/or other securities of the Issuer, unless all of the
beneficial owners of its securities are both QIBs and Qualified Purchasers; (iv) if it is an investment
company excepted from the U.S. Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or
Section 3(c)(7) thereof and was formed on or before April 30, 1996, it has received the consent of its
beneficial owners who acquired their interests on or before April 30, 1996, with respect to its treatment
as a Qualified Purchaser in the manner required by Section 2(a)(51)(C) of the U.S. Investment
Company Act and the rules promulgated thereunder; (v) it is not a partnership, common trust fund, or
corporation, special trust, pension fund or retirement plan, or other entity, in which the partners,
beneficiaries, beneficial owners, participants, shareholders or other equity owners, as the case may be,
may designate the particular investment to be made, or the allocation thereof, unless all such partners,
beneficiaries, beneficial owners, participants, shareholders or other equity owners are both QIBs and
Qualified Purchasers; and (vi) it has not invested more than 40% of its assets in the Notes (or beneficial
interests therein) and/or other securities of the Issuer after giving effect to the purchase of the Notes (or
beneficial interests therein), unless all of the beneficial owners of its securities are both QIBs and
Qualified Purchasers.

167


-----

(4) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers or any person representing the
Issue or the Initial Purchasers have not made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer or the
offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which
offering memorandum has been delivered to it. Accordingly, it acknowledges that no representation or
warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. The
purchaser has had access to such financial and other information as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of
and request information from the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, and it has received and reviewed all
information that it requested.

(5) The purchaser is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the U.S. Securities Act,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be, at all times, within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any exemption from registration available under
the U.S. Securities Act. The purchaser agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account
for which it is purchasing the Notes and each subsequent holder of the Notes, by its acceptance of the
Notes, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes only (a) to us or any subsidiary thereof,
(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act,
(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A to a person it reasonably
believes is a QIB that is also a Qualified Purchaser that purchases for its own account or for the account
of a QIB that is also a Qualified Purchaser, to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the
United States within the meaning of Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to
any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities
laws. The purchaser will, and each subsequent purchaser is required to, notify any subsequent
purchaser of the Notes from the purchaser or it of the resale restrictions referred to in the legend below.
Each purchaser acknowledges that we and the Trustee under the Indenture reserve the right prior to any
offer, sale or other transfer pursuant to clauses (d) or (e) to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee.

(6) The purchaser understands that if it is a non-U.S. person outside of the United States, the Notes will be
represented by a Regulation S Global Note and that transfers of such notes are restricted as described in
this section and in the section entitled “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance” or if it is a QIB that is
also a Qualified Purchaser, the Notes it purchases will be represented by a Rule 144A Global Note.
Such purchaser also confirms that it is not a retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the U.K. has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA or the U.K. may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each certificate representing a note will contain a legend substantially to
the following effect:

THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS

If applicable, the following legend shall also be included substantially in the following form:

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THIS NOTE WAS ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (“OID”) WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 1273 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE
“CODE”), AND THIS LEGEND IS REQUIRED BY SECTION 1275(c) OF THE CODE.

HOLDERS MAY OBTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF ANY OID, THE ISSUE
PRICE, THE ISSUE DATE AND THE YIELD TO MATURITY RELATING TO THE NOTES BY
CONTACTING THE DIRECTORS, 500 BROOK DRIVE, READING RG2 6UU, UNITED KINGDOM.

(7) The purchaser acknowledges that the registrar for the Notes will not be required to accept for
registration of transfer of any Notes acquired by them, except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to us, the Trustee and the registrar that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied
with.

(8) The purchaser agrees that it will deliver to each person, to whom it transfers Notes, notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such securities, including the minimum denomination requirements set
forth herein.

(9) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have
been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and
the Initial Purchaser. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account
and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements on
behalf of each such investor account.

(10) The purchaser represents that (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire and hold the Notes
constitutes assets of any employee benefits plan or similar arrangement or (ii) the purchase and holding
of the Notes by it will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or a violation under any applicable similar laws.

(11) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United
States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the
Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required. Consequently, any
transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth hereunder.

(12) The purchaser understands that the Issuer will likely be a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker
Rule. The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity
that would be an “investment company” under the 1940 Act, but for the exclusions provided under
Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it
will be considered a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable
exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. Accordingly, in the event the Issuer is considered a
“covered fund”, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker
Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an
“ownership interest” in the Issuer as a “covered fund”, unless such “banking entity” is able to rely on
an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is
broadly defined to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest. The phrase “other similar
interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule to include any interest that: (a) has the right to
participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of
directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the
covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of
default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an investment manager for
“cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s
resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR §248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2));
(b) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the
covered fund; (c) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other
interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies
upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (d) has the right to receive all or a

170

portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments
received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of
other outstanding interests); (e) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the
covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying
assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding
principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (f) receives
income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by
reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (g) any synthetic right to
have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in (a) through (f) above.

**ERISA Considerations**

By acquiring the Notes, you will be deemed to have further represented and agreed as follows:

(1) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein, (A) either
(i) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of (and for so long as you hold such Notes or any interest
therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), an employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”))
that is subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, a plan to which
Section 4975 of the Code, applies, or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” (within
the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3–101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) by reason of
such an employee benefit plan’s and/or plan’s investment in such entity (each, a “Benefit Plan
**Investor”), or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any U.S. federal, state,**
local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility
or prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the
Code (“Similar Laws”), and no part of the assets to be used by you to acquire or hold such Notes or
any interest therein constitutes the assets of any such Benefit Plan Investor or such a governmental,
church or non-U.S. plan, or (ii) your acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note, or any interest
therein does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/ or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental,
church or non-U.S. plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws); and (B) none of the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates is a Fiduciary (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, with respect to a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan, any definition of “fiduciary” under Similar Laws) with respect to you, as the purchaser
or holder, in connection with your purchase or holding of the Notes, or as a result of any exercise by
the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates of any rights in
connection with the Notes, and no advice provided by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or
any of their respective affiliates constitutes “investment advice” (within the meaning of Section 3(21)
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in connection with the Notes and the transactions contemplated
with respect to the Notes.

**Legal Investment Considerations**

If your investment activities are subject to regulation by federal, state or local law or governmental
authorities you should review the applicable laws and/or rules, policies and guidelines adopted from time to time
by such authorities before purchasing any Notes. No representation is made as to the proper characterization of
the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any Notes
under applicable law or other legal investment restrictions. Accordingly, if your investment activities are subject
to such laws and/or regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities you should
consult your own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the Notes constitute a legal
investment or are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, or any person who
controls them or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person make any
representation as to the proper characterization of the Notes for legal investment or other purposes, as to the
ability of particular investors to purchase the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of
particular investors to purchase the Notes under applicable investment restrictions. All institutions whose
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by
regulatory authorities should consult their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the
Notes are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

171


-----

none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 or any person who
controls them or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person makes
any representation as to the characterization of the Notes as a U.S.-domestic or foreign (non-U.S.) investment
under any state insurance code or related regulations, and they are not aware of any published precedent that
addresses such characterization. The uncertainties described above (and any unfavorable future determinations
concerning legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the Notes) may affect the
liquidity of the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions
in the purchase agreement relating to the Notes between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer has
agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has severally agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the principal amount of Notes set forth therein.

The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the relevant Notes if any of
them are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their
agreement to purchase relevant Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides
that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to approval of legal matters by
counsel and other conditions precedent.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuer has agreed that:

    - Subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act
relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby, issued by the
Issuer and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue for a period of 30 days after
the date hereof without the prior written consent of the Stabilizing Manager.

    - The Issuer will indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make
in respect of those liabilities.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchase of securities.

Each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made by its
purchase acknowledgements, representation, warranties and agreements as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes at the offering price that appears on the cover page
of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and
any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The
offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial
Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser
has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified
Purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and
Regulation S.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales
of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they
will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S.
law.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Manager
engages in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be,, business days (as such term

173


-----

is used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of the pricing of the Notes
(this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the next, business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

**Miscellaneous**

This document does not constitute, and may not be used for the purpose of, an offer or solicitation in or
from any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation is not authorized.

Attention is drawn to the information set out on the inside front cover of this document in respect of
restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes and on distribution of documents.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Issuer will apply to list
the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange as soon as practicable after the Issue Date.
The Initial Purchasers are not under an obligation to make a market in the Notes and any market making activity,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the
limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that a secondary market for the Notes will develop, or if one does develop, that it will continue. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of or trading market for the Notes.

No action has been taken or is being contemplated by the Issuer that would permit a public offering of the
Notes or possession or distribution of this offering memorandum or any amendment thereof, or supplement
thereto or any other offering material relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction where, or in any other
circumstances in which, action for those purposes is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or
from any jurisdiction except in circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers. Because of the restrictions
contained in the front of this offering memorandum, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any
offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes.

The Notes are offered when, as and if issued, subject to prior sale or withdrawal, cancellation or
modification of the offer without notice and subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain
other conditions.

Persons into whose hands this offering memorandum comes are required by the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which they
purchase, offer, sell or deliver Notes or have in their possession, distribute or publish this offering memorandum
or any other offering material relating to the Notes, in all cases at their own expense.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in
the future perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending, hedging and
capital markets services for VMED O2 UK Holdings, Virgin Media, Liberty Global, Telefónica and VMED O2
UK Holdco 4, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty Global, Virgin Media, Telefónica,
VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 and VMED O2 UK Holdings in the past. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of Virgin
Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, VMED O2 UK Holdings and/or their respective affiliates, as applicable, and
have hedged, and are likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco
4, VMED O2 UK Holdings and/or their respective affiliates consistent with their risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship

174


-----

with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates provide Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, VMED O2 UK Holdings and/or their
respective affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and are and may act as counterparties to certain
hedging agreements entered into by Virgin Media, VMED O2 UK Holdco 4, VMED O2 UK Holdings and/or
their respective affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such
capacities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive, directly or indirectly, certain
portion of the proceeds of the Notes in connection with the Refinancing Transactions.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuer. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/
or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with its registered
office and principal place of business in England. The Issuer is a financing company with no independent
operations or significant assets. As a result, it may not be possible for you to recover any payments of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts or purchase price with respect to the Notes or other payments or claims
in the United States upon judgments of U.S. courts for any such payments or claims. The United States and
England do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of a
fixed debt, sum of money, payment or claim rendered by any U.S. court based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in England. In
order to enforce such a U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated by way of common law
action before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In this type of action, an English court generally will
not (subject to the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S.
court and will treat the U.S. judgment as conclusive, and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment in England on such an action (assuming that any defense raised against it has no real prospect of
success). The matters which may cause an English court not to enforce a judgment debt created by a U.S.
judgment are that:

    - the relevant U.S. court did not have jurisdiction to give the judgment, or the party against whom the
judgment was given did not properly submit to the jurisdiction of the relevant U.S. court, according to
the applicable English rules of private international law;

    - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement
or a contractual choice of court agreement, unless the party against whom the judgment was given
properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant U.S. court;

    - the judgment was not final and conclusive on the merits. However, a judgment will be treated by an
English court as final and conclusive even though it is subject to an appeal or if an appeal is actually
pending, although in such a case a stay of execution of the judgment in England and Wales may be
ordered pending an appeal or possible appeal. If the judgment is given by a court of law of a district
forming part of a larger federal system such as in the United States, only the finality and
conclusiveness of the judgment in the district where it was given are relevant to whether that judgment
is enforceable in England and Wales. Its finality and conclusiveness in other parts of the federal system
are irrelevant;

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would contravene public policy in England and Wales;

    - the judgment is not for a definite sum of money or is for a sum payable in respect of taxes or other
charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a United States
law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law;

    - enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute. For example, section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 prohibits the enforcement of foreign judgments for multiple damages and
other foreign judgments specified by statutory instrument concerned with restrictive trade practices. A
judgment for multiple damages is defined as a judgment for an amount arrived at by doubling, trebling
or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained by the
judgment creditor;

    - the English proceedings to enforce the U.S. judgment were not commenced within the relevant
limitation period;

    - the judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an
English court, on the same subject matter and between the same parties;

    - the judgment was procured by fraud;

    - the judgment was given contrary to English principles of natural or substantial justice, for example
where the defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate
opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or where the defendant did not have the
opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment; and

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and
Judgments Act 1982 (as amended).

178


-----

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be
enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilize any method
or methods of enforcement available to them at the time. However, it may not be possible to obtain an English
judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings,
or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing and to matters referred to in “Description of the Collateral Sharing Agreement”,
investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from
United States federal or state courts in the manner described above using the methods available for enforcement
of a judgment of an English court. However, there can be no assurance that you will be able to enforce in
England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained in any U.S. court and there is doubt as to
whether an English court would impose civil liability in an action predicated upon the U.S. federal or state
securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The Issuer and certain of the Credit Facility Obligors are incorporated in England and Wales, and are
subject to the insolvency laws of England and Wales. The insolvency laws of England and Wales may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the bankruptcy laws of the United States or certain other jurisdictions.
In addition, there can be no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of these jurisdictions will be applied in
relation to one another. In the event that we or any one or more of our subsidiaries experience financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations of us and the Credit Facility Obligors, and therefore the ability of the Issuer to
make payments on the Notes.

**Overview of English Insolvency Proceedings**

English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a Credit Facility Obligor incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales (an “English Obligor”) experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of
England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an
application to the court for entry into administration, the company, the directors, or the holder of a “qualifying
floating charge” (discussed below) entering into administration or appointing administrators through an out of
court procedure (respectively), or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving
to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be
placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is
reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “U.K. Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is
unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis
(unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or,
among other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750.0 or to
satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).

English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the obligations of the Credit
Facility Obligors. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to
such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their
rights and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the relevant English
Obligor.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Security Documents and the Credit Facility Collateral constitute fixed and floating charge security over
the relevant assets subject to such security.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.
Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating
charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation
of such security contained in the relevant floating charge of which the fixed charge holder had notice); (b)
general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders and the costs of
continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an
insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets
(including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging
company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in
priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to
property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating

180


-----

charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
“Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of
certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority
_of claims in an English insolvency proceeding”); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in_
relation to floating charge security.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be
created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests
will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend,
among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s
ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by
the security holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a
purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold
that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a
fixed charge.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a proceeding where the relevant company’s assets are sold, the proceeds distributed to
creditors (see “—Priority of claims in an English insolvency proceeding” below) and the company is dissolved.
There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary
liquidation (members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation), by resolution of the company’s
members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question: in a
members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s
solvency over the following 12 months whereas in a creditors’ voluntary liquidation no such declaration is
required. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay
its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the U.K. Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as
an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is
subject to some degree of control by the creditors where the company in question is insolvent (including control
over the choice of liquidator). Compulsory liquidation is commenced by the filing of a winding-up petition with
the court, most likely by a creditor, but also possibly by the company or one of its directors. Compulsory
liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings may be available to foreign companies with
sufficient nexus to the U.K.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation.
In a compulsory liquidation, under Section 127 of the U.K. Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void
(see “—Dispositions in Winding-up” below). However, in certain circumstances this will not apply to any
property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement
under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in
accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company
by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a
winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action
or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject
to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary liquidation however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the U.K. Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up. Rather, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to
prevent any actions or proceedings being started or continued, although note that the ordinary practice is to grant
the stay on proceedings brought by a creditor in respect of a debt that is largely admitted and should be
determined in the liquidation as opposed to through separate legal proceedings. This is important because it
means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

181


-----

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property, to
execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Possible
_challenges”)._

**_Priority of claims in an English insolvency proceeding_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in
question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the U.K. Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors
are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property
applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a priorranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with each other and the company,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to
each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” (defined in Rule 14.24(6) of the
Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016) applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime
sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and
only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the
company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets
covers that indebtedness (net of the costs of realizing those assets).

    - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (including liquidators’ and administrators’
remuneration) (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are
paid).

    - Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts
owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension
schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract
has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As
between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI
contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding
corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees
and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally.

    - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This
would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it
but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing
asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below), must,
subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors.

    - Fifth ranking:

       - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets,
as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditors elects to
surrender its security;

182


-----

       - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Credit Facility,
such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of
such security recoveries; and

       - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.
This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme
Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017.

    - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation (provided that the terms do not contravene the U.K.
Insolvency Act or English common law).

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency officeholder of a company (i.e., an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first
£10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over
£10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be
distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the
maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless
the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Administration_**

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act, pursuant to which a company
may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company may be put
into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. English insolvency law
provides that a company may be placed into administration if it is incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a
state in the EEA or if (irrespective of its country of incorporation) it has its center of main interests (“COMI”) in
the U.K. or in an European Union member state (other than Denmark). An English court may also place a
company into administration upon a request from the court of another part of the U.K. or certain other relevant
countries or territories. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into
administration at the application of, among others, itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including
contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the company
also has the right to appoint an administrator. Different procedures apply according to the identity of the
appointer. In addition, a qualifying floating charge holder has the right to intervene in an administration
application by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the
appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative receivership”
below). In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint
an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the U.K. Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying
floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is
a qualifying floating charge. It is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole
or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage
of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administrator may be appointed (either by a court
or via the out-of-court process) if (which varies depending on the method of appointment): (a) the company
proposed to be the subject of the order is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts”; and (b) the
administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of administration. If a qualifying
floating charge holder appoints an administrator, there is no requirement for the company to be insolvent,

183


-----

although the floating charge underlying the appointment must be enforceable. Administration proceedings are
supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a
going concern or, if the administrator thinks that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into immediate liquidation (without first being in
administration), if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a
whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured and/or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out above (see
“—Priority of Claims in an English Insolvency Proceeding” above).

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed
and, subject to certain requirements under the U.K. Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge). While an administrator is in office in respect of
an English Obligor, the powers of the board of directors of that English Obligor (save those that do not interfere
with the exercise of the administrator’s powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended. A set
proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside
for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see
“—Prescribed Part” above). With prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the
administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question
towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order
(in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of an
out-of-court appointment) is filed at the court. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a
full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which creditors cannot take actions against the relevant company,
including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the relevant
company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the relevant company’s possession under a hire purchase
agreement without the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for
consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings,
execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above. Certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain
defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the
statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial
collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations. If an English Obligor were to enter
administration, it is possible that the security granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration,
without leave of the court or consent of the administrator.

Claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval generally will be
required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and
processing of claims before interim dividends are paid.

**_Administrative receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very
limited circumstances. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” (as described above) to a party for the
purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an
administrator out of court and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying
floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the
exceptions under the U.K. Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the
appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the U.K.
Insolvency Act), which applies if the arrangement creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English
Obligor during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market
investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments,
and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an

184


-----

undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver
will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the
administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges; see “—Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a
fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited
circumstances) pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to
augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such a fixed
charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator or an administrator. However, where an administrator
has been appointed to a company, a fixed charge receiver cannot be appointed without the leave of the court or
the consent of the administrator. If a fixed charge receiver has been appointed before the appointment of an
administrator, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge
receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral
arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above).

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointer. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who
performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a
proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver
will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed
charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of
the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointer).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors
(see “—Fixed versus floating charges” above).

**_Possible challenges_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to the
court to challenge transactions entered into by a company if the company is unable to pay its debts (as defined in
the U.K. Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or if the company becomes unable to pay its debts as a
result of the transaction (see above for a description of when a company may be deemed unable to pay its debts).
Generally, only an administrator or liquidator of a company may bring a claim challenging a reviewable
transaction. However, a challenge to a transaction defrauding creditors under Section 423 of the U.K. Insolvency
Act may be brought by any party that is a victim of the transaction. Moreover, under section 246ZD of the U.K.
Insolvency Act, liquidators and administrators have the ability to assign the cause of action in respect of any
transaction at an undervalue claim, preference claim and extortionate credit claim.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company
making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the
company received significantly less value (in money or money’s worth) than it gave in return. The court has
powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore the position to what it would have been had the company
not entered into that transaction. A court should not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the relevant
company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the
time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. The
court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending
with the onset of insolvency (please see below for details of when the onset of insolvency occurs). The order
could include reducing payments or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection
for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith
for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator

185


-----

to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a
connected person (see “—Connected Persons” below), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and
the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

**_Preferences_**

A transaction might also be challenged as a preference where the relevant company has done something or
suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position
than he would have been in had that thing not been done in the event of the relevant company going into
insolvent liquidation. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to prefer that party. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety
or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what
it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments or
setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific circumstances for a third
party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value
without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time (as defined in Section 123 of the
U.K. Insolvency Act) and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person, in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in
a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of
the company, to prefer them. If the preference is given to a person connected to the company (other than an
employee), the court looks back and sets aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending
with the date of the onset of the company’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court
can only go back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of
insolvency.

**_Transactions defrauding creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is
making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This
provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if
the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and,
subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Pensions Regulator and the U.K.
Prudential Regulation Authority. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within
which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company
does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments or setting
aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor
company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person
who received a benefit from such transaction to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

Furthermore, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit
transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years
before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is
“extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or
were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of
fair dealing. If a transaction entered into by a company is found to be an extortionate credit transaction the court
can make one or more orders specified in the U.K. Insolvency Act, including an order setting aside the whole or
any part of any obligation created by the extortionate credit transaction, an order varying the terms of the
extortionate credit transaction or the terms on which any security for the extortionate credit transaction is held, or

186


-----

an order requiring any person to pay to the administrator or liquidator any sums paid to that person, by virtue of
the extortionate credit transaction, by the relevant company.

**_Avoidance of floating charges_**

The U.K. Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company
during the “relevant time” may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a
floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to the company, the relevant time is
deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of insolvency and at the time the charge was granted
the company must have been unable to pay its debts or have become unable to pay its debts as a result of the
transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted. If the floating charge is created in favor of a
person connected to the company, the relevant time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency
and the requirement for the company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to
become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply. A floating charge over a company’s property will
be invalid pursuant to Section 245 of the U.K. Insolvency Act if the floating charge was given in exchange for
prior consideration (that is, for example, to secure loans previously made). However, if the floating charge
qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as amended),
the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a
liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid.
Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the
value of any money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt owed by,
the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest),
whether or not (in the case of a floating charge granted in favor of a person connected to the company only) the
relevant company is unable to pay its debts at the time of grant or becomes unable to pay its debts as a
consequence of the transaction under which the charge was created.

As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that an English Obligor becomes unable
to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the Issue Date (or three years if the transactions are found to
be an extortionate credit transaction), an administrator or liquidator is appointed and the conditions contemplated
in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of the relevant security and/or guarantees may be
challenged by a liquidator or administrator (or any creditor if the transactions are found to be a transaction
defrauding creditors) or a court may set aside the granting of the security and/or guarantees as invalid.

**_Connected persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator. A connected person for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue,
preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such
director or shadow director, or an associate of the relevant company. A person is associated with an individual if
he/she is: (i) the individual’s spouse or civil partner; (ii) a relative of the individual or the individual’s spouse or
civil partner; or (iii) the spouse or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the individual’s spouse or civil
partner. A person is associated with a company if employed by that company. A company is associated with
another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons
who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or
more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be
regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as
replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A company is an associate of another person if that person has
control of it or if that person and persons who are his associates together have control of it.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or
instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration the onset of

187


-----

insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an
administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the
winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company
passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the
same as the initial administration.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to
them as fixed charges is not determinative.

Where the company or the security provider is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the
chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the
security agent has the requisite degree of control over the company’s or the security provider’s ability to deal in
the relevant assets and the proceeds therefrom and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security agent
in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed
charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of: (i) the
unsecured creditors of the company or the relevant security provider in respect of that part of the company’s or
the security provider’s net property which is ring-fenced (see explanation about the Prescribed Part above); and
(ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the company or the security provider may have priority
over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned
above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent
as floating charge holder. It is also possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to
the whole or substantially the whole of property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a
qualifying floating charge.

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or
other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or
perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be
unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company
that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially
disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power
to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract insofar as it has been performed nor can it,
except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or
liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the
disclaimer, is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English
law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the
discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security
interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in
certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and
notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and
relevant legal entities.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed

188


-----

by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and/or security can be found to be void and the
respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing
with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor in question by virtue of
entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act
in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the relevant English
Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or
insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction
may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors
need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not
prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place
when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with
“likely” in this context meaning “probable”.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the
extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

**_Security registration_**

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant
security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to
register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period.
When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to
become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an
order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has
expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with
the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly
does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies although registration with applicable asset
registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Account banks’ right to set-off_**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each a “Bank Account Charge”) granted by a security over
certain of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”)
may hold a right at any time (whether prior to or following a crystallization event under the Bank Account
Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
arrangements with the security provider. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely
floating (rather than a fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the
relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant
Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on
enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the security provider) and the Account
Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account
Bank’s netting and set-off rights.

**_Dispositions in Winding-up_**

Other than set out in this section, any disposition of an English Obligor’s property made after a compulsory
winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a
company is deemed to commence when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company,
rather than the date on which that court makes the winding-up order (if any). A disposition made by a secured
party as a result of the enforcement of security held by it after the presentation of a winding-up petition will not
be void merely because a winding-up petition has already been presented, as such a disposition would be made
by the secured party (or its nominee) and not by the company that is the subject of the winding-up petition.

189


-----

**_Foreign currency_**

Where creditors of an English Obligor are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, and the
debt is payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as any debt arising under the Notes or in respect of
the Credit Facility) the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at
a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on
the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to
be unreasonable, they may apply to the court to challenge the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into liquidation
or administration and receipt of any amounts to which the Issuer (in respect of the Credit Facility) or the
Noteholders (in respect of the Notes) may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are
not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or
any other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to
that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than the England and Wales or is not governed by English law,
the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third parties_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement (a “scheme”) that effects a compromise of a
company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may
be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign guarantor which is liable to
be wound up under the U.K. Insolvency Act and has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also
pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb
has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s
finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its
particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the
grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case (particularly where such previous cases pre-date the
transition period following the U.K.’s exit from the European Union).

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of
the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in
respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that
will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more
by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the
proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then
that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those
affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then
needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme
and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as
approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part 26A thereof,
which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its

190


-----

creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’. While
generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes, a company seeking to enter into a
restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties
that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise
or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it
is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator
or administrator appointed to the company. The consent of the company (by its directors or shareholders or,
where the company is in an insolvent regime, by its insolvency officeholder) is required if the plan is proposed
by a creditor or shareholder. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the
rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such
creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no
requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting,
and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the
court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring
plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring
plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic
interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of
this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for
the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or
more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of
one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court
has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan
binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective
(in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the
Registrar of Companies or, where the company is an overseas company, publication of the court’s order in the
Gazette.

As with schemes, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules
applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the
“Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the U.K.,
where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border
**Insolvency Regulations”) (and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (SI 2007/115)**
with respect to Northern Ireland). The Model Law provides for recognition of certain U.K. insolvency
proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is
determined to be in U.K.) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another
jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in U.K.) upon application by the relevant insolvency
officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been

191


-----

implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations provide for recognition in the U.K. of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if
the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if
the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention 2005”) where applicable. As of January 15,
2024, the U.K. Government has signed the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention 2019”), which will
come into force 12 months after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings commenced after that date. In
addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No
593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual
obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing
area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding
matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as
the Hague Convention 2005 (or the Hague Convention 2019), or whether they will be treated more akin to
insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the U.K.’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the transition period, U.K.
proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in European Union member states. As
the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the U.K. do not include a replacement
regime for the current automatic recognition of U.K. insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice
versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the U.K. and one or more
European Union member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Until a mutual recognition agreement is reached and becomes effective, it is likely to be more problematic
for U.K. restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in European Union member states and for
U.K. officeholders to effectively deal with assets located in European Union member states than when the U.K.
was a member state of the EU. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the
private international law rules adopted in the relevant European Union member state and the need may well arise
to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the
appointment of a U.K. officeholder is made in reliance on a U.K. domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is
much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other European Union member states. To the
extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative
basis for recognition in European Union member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the European
Union member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the U.K. was
a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be
recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

F-2


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**

**1** **Our opinion is unmodified**

We have audited the financial statements of VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (“the Company”) for the year
ended 31 December 2022 which comprise the Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit or Loss, Statement of Changes
in Equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2.

In our opinion:

    - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at
31 December 2022 and of the result for the year then ended;

    - the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance UK-adopted international
accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

    - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and
are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical
Standard as applied to listed other entities of public interest. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**2** **Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the
audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the
key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:

**Recoverability of loans to group undertakings**

_The risk — Accounting treatment:_

The carrying amount of loans to group undertakings represent 99.99% of the company’s total assets.

The recoverability of loans to group undertakings is not considered a significant risk or subject to significant
judgement. However, due to the materiality of this balance in the context of the financial statements, this is
considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on the company audit.

_Our response_

Tests of details — We compared the carrying amount of the loans to group undertakings, with the relevant
subsidiary balance sheet to identify whether the net assets of the subsidiary, being an approximation of
subsidiary’s minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of the carrying amount and assessed whether the
subsidiary group has historically been profit-making.

_Our results_

We found the carrying amounts of the loans due from group undertakings to be acceptable.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I**
**PLC — (CONTINUED)**

**3** **Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit**

Materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at £90,000,000, determined with reference to a
benchmark of total assets of £4,476,631,000, which represents 2%. We consider total assets to represent the most
relevant benchmark for the purposes of our materiality assessment.

Performance materiality was set at 75% of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates
to £67,500,000.

We agreed to report to those charged with governance any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements
exceeding £2,250,000, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative
grounds.

**4** **Going concern**

The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and
the Company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”), as the group has received
a letter of support from is parent entity VMED O2 UK Limited.

Our procedures included:

   - We assessed the appropriateness of the letter of intent provided by VMED O2 UK Limited, the
Company’s ultimate parent undertaking, to the Directors of the Company and the ability to provide that
support.

   - Critically assessing assumptions in VMED O2 UK Limited’s base case and downside scenarios
relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics, in particular by comparing to economic forecasts, approved
budgets and our knowledge of the Group and the sector in which it operates.

   - We also compared past budgets to actual results to assess the Directors’ track record of budgeting
accurately.

Our conclusions based on this work:

    - we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate;

    - we have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material
uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt
on the Group’s or Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period; and

    - we found the going concern disclosure in note 2.2 to be acceptable.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above
conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.

**5** **Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations — ability to detect**

_Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud_

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that
could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk

F-4


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I**
**PLC — (CONTINUED)**

assessment procedures included enquiring of directors and inspection of policy documentation made available by
VMED O2 UK Limited to VMED O2 UK Financing I plc and adherence to by it’s group companies, addressing
procedures to prevent and detect fraud that apply to this group company as well as enquiring whether the
directors have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud. As required by auditing standards, we
perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that
management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. On this audit we do not believe there
is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there are no revenue transactions. We did not identify any
additional fraud risks. We performed procedures including agreeing all accounting entries in the period to
supporting documentation.

_Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement related to compliance with laws and regulations_

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on
the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience and through discussion with the
directors (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations. The company is subject to laws and regulations that directly
affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation),
distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws
and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. This company, as a holding
company, is not subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a
material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements.

_Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation_

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected
some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed
our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained
a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material
misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**6** **We have nothing to report on the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report**

The directors are responsible for the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and the other information
presented in the annual report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover those reports and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and, in doing so, consider whether,
based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material
misstatements in the other information.

**_Strategic report and directors’ report_**

Based solely on our work on the other information:

    - we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;

    - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the
financial statements; and

    - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I**
**PLC — (CONTINUED)**

**7** **We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

    - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

    - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

    - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

    - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**8** **Respective responsibilities**

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible for: the preparation
of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities.

**9** **The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**1.** **Company information**

The principal activity of VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (the company) is the provision of financing to
fellow group subsidiaries and that of a holding company.

The company is a public company incorporated, domiciled and registered in the UK. The registered number
is 12800739 and the registered address is Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London, United Kingdom,
W6 8BS.

**2.** **Accounting policies**

**2.1 Basis of accounting**

A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below. All accounting policies have been applied
consistently, unless noted below.

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost basis
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure
Framework (“FRS 101”).

In preparing these financial statements, the company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure
requirements of International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.

The company’s ultimate parent undertaking, VMED O2 UK Limited, includes the company in its
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of VMED O2 UK Limited are prepared
in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

In these financial statements, the company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of
the following disclosures:

    - a cash flow statement and related notes;

    - disclosures in respect of related party transactions with fellow group undertakings;

    - disclosures in respect of capital management;

    - the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;

    - disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel; and

    - disclosures of transactions with a management entity that provides key management personnel services
to the company.

**2.2 Going concern**

Notwithstanding net current liabilities of £27,288,000 as at 31 December 2022 (2021 — net current
liabilities of £28,915,000) and a profit for the year then ended of £nil (2021 — profit of £nil), the financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the directors consider to be appropriate for the
following reasons.

After making suitable enquiries and obtaining the necessary assurances, including a letter of support from
VMED O2 UK Limited, that sufficient resources will be made available to meet any liabilities as they fall due,
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. As with any company placing reliance on other group entities for financial

F-10


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

support, the directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will continue although at the
date of approval of these financial statements they have no reason to believe that it will not do so, and continued
operations are key to the wider group.

It is not VMED O2’s practice to prepare forecasts and projections for individual entities that are wholly
owned by the group, as operational and financial management is undertaken at a group level.

However, forecasts and projections which take into account of reasonably possible downsides in trading
performance, have been prepared for the group as a whole and these showed that cash on hand, together with
cash from operations and the revolving credit facility, are expected to be sufficient for the group and hence the
company’s cash requirements through to at least 12 months from the approval of these financial statements.

Taking into account these forecasts and projections and after making enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation the company has adequate support and resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Consequently, the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to
continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial
statements and consequently have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

**2.3 Finance income**

Finance income is recognised as interest accrues according to the effective interest rate method, which uses
the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the
net carrying amount.

**2.4 Debtors**

Debtors are initially measured at fair value and subsequently reported at amortised cost, net of an allowance
for impairment of trade receivables.

The company uses a forward looking impairment model which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance
which is estimated based upon our assessment of anticipated loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We
use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing
and anticipated economic conditions, and specific customer credit risk. The allowance is maintained until either
payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

**2.5 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less.

**2.6 Creditors**

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

Creditors are presented as amounts falling due within one year unless payment is not due within 12 months
after the reporting period.

**2.7 Loans and borrowings**

All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance costs using the effective
interest method.

F-11


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

Finance costs which are incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and set off against the
borrowings to which they relate. Deferred finance costs are amortised over the term of the related debt using the
effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as creditors: amounts falling due within one year unless the company has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period in which
case they are classified as creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year.

**2.8 Foreign currencies**

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

**3.** **Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In preparing these financial statements, management has made estimates and judgements that affect the
application of the company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses.

**Estimates and assumptions**

**_Recoverability of intercompany receivables_**

Intercompany receivables are stated at their recoverable amount less any necessary provision.
Recoverability of intercompany receivables is assessed annually and a provision is recognised if any indications
exist that the receivables are not considered recoverable.

**4.** **Operating profit**

The operating profit is stated after crediting:

Certain expenses are specifically attributed to the company. Where costs are incurred by other group
companies on behalf of the company, expenses are allocated to the company on a basis that, in the opinion of the
directors, is reasonable.

**5.** **Auditor’s remuneration**

Auditor’s remuneration of £11,500 (2021—£10,800) for the audit of the financial statements has been borne
by a fellow group undertaking and not recharged.

**6.** **Employees**

The company does not have any directly employed staff and is not charged an allocation of staff costs by the
group. Details of staff numbers and staff costs of the group are disclosed in the Consolidated Annual Report of
VMED O2 UK Limited.

The directors received no remuneration for the qualifying services as directors of this company. All
directors’ remuneration for those which were in office during 2021 is disclosed in the Consolidated Annual
Report of VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited, which is available from the company secretary at 500 Brook Drive,
Reading, United Kingdom, RG2 6UU.

On 10 August 2020, the company issued 1 ordinary share with a nominal value of £1 for a consideration of

On 8 September 2020, the company issued 49,999 shares with a nominal value of £1 for a consideration of

**Share Capital**

The balance classified as share capital represents the nominal value on issue of the company’s share capital,
comprising £1 ordinary shares.

**Retained earnings**

Includes all current and prior period retained profits and losses net of dividends paid.

**16.** **Guarantees**

Fellow group undertakings are party to a senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks. As at
31 December 2022, this comprised term facilities that amounted to £7,501 million (2021 — £5,916 million) of
which £650 million was undrawn (2021 — fully drawn) and revolving credit facilities of £1,378 million (2021 —
£1,378 million), which were undrawn as at 31 December 2022 and 2021. Borrowings under the facilities are
secured against the assets of certain members of the group.

In addition, a fellow group undertaking has issued senior secured notes which, subject to certain exceptions,
share the same guarantees and security which have been granted in favour of the senior secured credit facility.
The amount outstanding under the senior secured notes at 31 December 2022 amounted to £8,544 million
(2021 — £8,066 million). Borrowings under the notes are secured against the assets of certain members of the
group.

Furthermore, a fellow group undertaking has issued senior notes for which certain fellow group
undertakings, have guaranteed the notes on a senior subordinated basis. The amount outstanding under the senior
notes as at 31 December 2022 amounted to approximately £1,207 million (2021 — £1,103 million).

The company is a member of the group, which manages its liquidity at the consolidated group level. As
such, while the company is not itself a guarantor of the credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior notes
discussed above, any action to enforce the guarantees and security given by fellow group undertakings could
impact upon the company as a part of that group.

**17. Controlling party**

The company’s immediate parent undertaking is VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited.

The smallest and largest groups of which the company is a member and into which the company’s accounts
were consolidated at 31 December 2022 are VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited and VMED O2 UK Limited,
respectively.

The company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party at 31 December 2022 was VMED O2 UK
Limited.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**

**1** **Our opinion is unmodified**

We have audited the financial statements of VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (“the company”) for the period
from 10 August 2020 to 31 December 2021 which comprise the Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit or Loss,
Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2.

In our opinion:

    - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at
31 December 2021 and of the result for the period then ended;

    - the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards,
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

    - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and
are independent of the company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard
as applied to listed other entities of public interest. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a
sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**2** **Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the
audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the
key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:

**Recoverability of loans to group undertakings**

_The risk — Accounting treatment:_

The carrying amount of loans to group undertakings represent 99.96% of the company’s total assets.

The recoverability of loans to group undertakings is not considered a significant risk or subject to significant
judgement. However, due to the materiality of this balance in the context of the financial statements, this is
considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on the company audit.

_Our response_

_Tests of details — We compared the carrying amount of the company’s loans to group undertakings, with_
the relevant subsidiary balance sheet to identify whether the net assets of the subsidiary, being an approximation
of the subsidiary’s minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of the carrying amount and assessed whether
the subsidiary group has historically been profit-making.

_Our results_

We found the carrying amounts of the loans due from group undertakings to be acceptable.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I**
**PLC — (Continued)**

**3** **Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit**

Materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at £41,900,000, determined with reference to a
benchmark of total assets of £4,191,889,000, which represents 1%. We consider total assets to represent the most
relevant benchmark for the purposes of our materiality assessment.

Performance materiality was set at 85% of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates
to £35,630,000.

We agreed to report to those charged with governance any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements
exceeding £2,095,000, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative
grounds.

**4** **Going concern**

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to
liquidate the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group’s and
the company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”), as the group has received
a letter of intent from is parent entity VMED O2 UK Limited.

Our procedures included:

    - We assessed the appropriateness of the letter of intent provided by VMED O2 UK Limited, the
company’s ultimate parent undertaking, to the directors of the company and the ability to provide that
support.

    - Critically assessing assumptions in VMED O2 UK Limited’s base case and downside scenarios
relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics, in particular by comparing to economic forecasts, approved
budgets and our knowledge of the group and the sector in which it operates.

    - We also compared past budgets to actual results to assess the directors’ track record of budgeting
accurately.

We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 2.2 to the financial statements gives a full and
accurate description of the directors’ assessment of going concern.

Our conclusions based on this work:

    - we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate;

    - we have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material
uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt
on the group’s or company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period; and

    - we found the going concern disclosure in note 2 to be acceptable.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above
conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in operation.

**PLC — (Continued)**

**5** **Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations — ability to detect**

Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that
could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk
assessment procedures included enquiring of directors and inspection of policy documentation made available by
VMED O2 UK Limited to VMED O2 UK Financing I plc and adherence to it by it’s group companies,
addressing procedures to prevent and detect fraud that apply to this group company as well as enquiring whether
the directors have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of
controls, in particular the risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries.
On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there are no revenue
transactions. We did not identify any additional fraud risks. We performed procedures including agreeing all
accounting entries in the period to supporting documentation.

Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement related to compliance with laws and regulations

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on
the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience and through discussion with the
directors (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations. The company is subject to laws and regulations that directly
affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation),
distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws
and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. This company, as a holding
company, is not subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a
material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements.

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected
some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed
our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained
a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material
misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**6** **We have nothing to report on the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report**

The directors are responsible for the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and the other information
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and, in doing so, consider whether,
based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material
misstatements in the other information.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF VMED O2 UK FINANCING I**
**PLC — (Continued)**

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

Based solely on our work on the other information:

    - we have not identified material misstatements in those reports;

    - in our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial
period is consistent with the financial statements; and

    - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**7** **We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

    - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

    - the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

    - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

    - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**8** **Respective responsibilities**

**_Directors’ responsibilities_**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 7, the directors are responsible for: the
preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless they either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

**_Auditor’s responsibilities_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**1.** **Company information**

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (the company), was incorporated on the 10 August 2020. On 20 August
2020, the name of the company was changed from Newco Financing I plc to VMED O2 UK Financing I plc.

The principal activity of the company is the provision of financing to fellow group subsidiaries and that of a
holding company.

The company is a public company incorporated, domiciled and registered in the UK. The registered number
is 12800739 and the registered address is Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London, United Kingdom,
W6 8BS.

**2.** **Accounting policies**

**2.1 Basis of accounting**

A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below. All accounting policies have been applied
consistently, unless noted below.

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost basis
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure
Framework (“FRS 101”).

In preparing these financial statements, the company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure
requirements of International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.

The company’s intermediate parent undertaking, VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited, includes the company in
its consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited
are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and are available from the company secretary at 500 Brook Drive, Reading, United
Kingdom, RG2 6UU.

In these financial statements, the company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of
the following disclosures:

    - a cash flow statement and related notes;

    - disclosures in respect of related party transactions with fellow group undertakings;

    - disclosures in respect of capital management;

    - the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;

    - disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel; and

    - disclosures of transactions with a management entity that provides key management personnel services
to the company.

**2.2 Going concern**

Notwithstanding net current liabilities of £28,915,000 as at 31 December 2021 and a result for the period
then ended of £nil, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the directors
consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.

After making suitable enquiries and obtaining the necessary assurances, including a letter of support from
VMED O2 UK Limited, that sufficient resources will be made available to meet any liabilities as they fall due,

F-25


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)**
**FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. As with any company placing reliance on other group entities for financial
support, the directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will continue although at the
date of approval of these financial statements they have no reason to believe that it will not do so, and continued
operations are key to the wider group.

It is not VMED O2’s practice to prepare forecasts and projections for individual entities that are wholly
owned by the group, as operational and financial management is undertaken at a group level.

However, forecasts and projections which take into account of reasonably possible downsides in trading
performance, have been prepared for the group as a whole and these showed that cash on hand, together with
cash from operations and the revolving credit facility, are expected to be sufficient for the group and hence the
company’s cash requirements through to at least 12 months from the approval of these financial statements.

Taking into account these forecasts and projections and after making enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation the company has adequate support and resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Consequently, the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to
continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial
statements and consequently have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. Consideration of
the on-going impact of COVID-19 has not altered this conclusion.

**2.3 Finance income**

Finance income is recognised as interest accrues according to the effective interest rate method, which uses
the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the
net carrying amount.

**2.4 Trade receivables and other debtors**

Trade receivables and other debtors are initially measured at fair value and subsequently reported at
amortised cost, net of an allowance for impairment of trade receivables.

The company uses a forward looking impairment model which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance
which is estimated based upon our assessment of anticipated loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We
use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing
and anticipated economic conditions, and specific customer credit risk. The allowance is maintained until either
payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

**2.5 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less.

**2.6 Creditors**

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

Creditors are presented as amounts falling due within one year unless payment is not due within 12 months
after the reporting period.

**2.7 Loans and borrowings**

All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.

F-26


-----

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)**
**FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance costs using the effective
interest method.

Finance costs which are incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and set off against the
borrowings to which they relate. Deferred finance costs are amortised over the term of the related debt using the
effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as creditors: amounts falling due within one year unless the company has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period in which
case they are classified as creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year.

**2.8 Foreign currencies**

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

**3.** **Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In preparing these financial statements, management has made estimates and judgements that affect the
application of the company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses.

**Estimates and assumptions**

**_Recoverability of intercompany receivables_**

Intercompany receivables are stated at their recoverable amount less any necessary provision.
Recoverability of intercompany receivables is assessed annually and a provision is recognised if any indications
exist that the receivables are not considered recoverable.

**4.** **Operating profit**

The operating profit is stated after crediting:

Certain expenses are specifically attributed to the company. Where costs are incurred by other group
companies on behalf of the company, expenses are allocated to the company on a basis that, in the opinion of the

Borrowings under the notes are secured against the assets of certain members of the group.

Furthermore, a fellow group undertaking has issued senior notes for which certain fellow group
undertakings, have guaranteed the notes on a senior subordinated basis. The amount outstanding under the senior
notes as at 31 December 2021 amounted to approximately £1,103 million.

The company is a member of the group, which manages its liquidity at the consolidated group level. As
such, while the company is not itself a guarantor of the credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior notes
discussed above, any action to enforce the guarantees and security given by fellow group undertakings could
impact upon the company as a part of that group.

obtained if such individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of
diligence and care as would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or deliver
a required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is
remedied, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be remedied without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default
for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in Clause 24.2 (Financial information), or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be remedied upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in this

the increased Commitments which it is to assume as if it had been an Original Lender; each of the
Obligors and any Increase Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights
against one another as the Obligors and the Increase Lender would have assumed and/or acquired had
the Increase Lender been an Original Lender.

(d) Each Increase Lender shall become a Party as a “Lender” and any Increase Lender and each of the

proposed to be used for Acquisition Debt, the ratio of Senior Net Debt to Annualised
EBITDA would not be greater than it was immediately prior to the relevant acquisition or
such other transaction;

cancellation is not funded or effected with any long-term Financial Indebtedness (including
Financial Indebtedness in the form of a bridge or other interim credit facility intended to be
refinanced with long-term Financial Indebtedness); and

(D) any amount of Financial Indebtedness available to be incurred pursuant to paragraphs

Facilities under sub-paragraph (A) prior to using amounts available under sub-paragraph (C) and
(D); (y) amounts incurred pursuant to sub-paragraph (D) substantially concurrently with amounts
incurred pursuant to sub-paragraph (A) will not count as Financial Indebtedness for the purposes
of calculating Senior Net Debt and (z) the Company shall have the ability to classify such amounts
of Financial Indebtedness on the date of their incurrence and shall only be required to include the
amount and type of such Financial Indebtedness in one of such sub-paragraphs above and will be
permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of such Financial
Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in suchparagraphs, and, from time to time, may reclassify all or a portion of such Financial Indebtedness,
in any manner,

(the “Additional Facilities Cap”);

relating to, or in connection with, any Additional Facility which is a revolving facility, the Facility
Agent) and set out in the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed;

(iv) the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed shall specify whether that Additional Facility

to the Facility Agent) that it requires the relevant Borrower of the relevant Documentary Credit or
proposed Documentary Credit to provide cash cover to an account with that L/C Bank in an amount
equal to that Lender’s L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of that Documentary Credit and in the
currency of that Documentary Credit then that Borrower shall do so within five Business Days after the

Borrower’s obligation to pay any Documentary Credit fee in relation to the relevant Documentary
Credit to the Facility Agent (for the account of that Lender) in accordance with Clause 17

that obligation to provide cash cover (and for so long as the relevant amount of cash cover continues to
stand as collateral).

Borrower provides cash cover pursuant to this Clause 5.10 (Cash Cover by Borrower) and of any

the Acceleration Date.

(d) On receipt of the information referred to in paragraph (c) above, the Facility Agent will promptly
determine what adjustment payments (if any) are necessary as between the Lenders participating in
Revolving Facility A, Revolving Facility B or relevant Additional Facility (as applicable) and each
related Ancillary Facility Lender in order to ensure that, following such adjustment payments, the
requirements of paragraph (b) above are complied with.

(e) The Facility Agent will notify all the Lenders as soon as practicable of its determinations pursuant to
paragraph (d) above, giving details of the adjustment payments required to be made. Such adjustment
payments shall be payable by the relevant Lenders and shall be made to the Facility Agent within five
Business Days following receipt of such notification from the Facility Agent. The Facility Agent shall
distribute the adjustment payments received, among the Ancillary Facility Lenders and the Lenders
participating in Revolving Facility A, Revolving Facility B or relevant Additional Facility (as
applicable) in order to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) above.

(f) If at any time following the Acceleration Date, the amount of Revolving Facility A Outstandings,
Revolving Facility B Outstandings or Additional Facility Outstandings (as applicable) of any Lender or
related Ancillary Facility Outstandings of any Ancillary Facility Lender used in the Facility Agent’s
calculation of the adjustments required under paragraph (d) above should vary for any reason (other
than as a result of currency exchange fluctuation or other reason which affects all relevant Lenders
equally), further adjustment payments shall be made on the same basis (mutatis mutandis) provided for
in this Clause 6.3 (Ancillary Facility Default).

(g) In respect of any amount paid by any Lender (a “Paying Lender”) pursuant to either of paragraph
(e) or (f) above, as between a relevant Borrower and the Paying Lender, the amount so paid shall be
immediately due and payable by such relevant Borrower to the Paying Lender and the payment
obligations of such relevant Borrower to the Lender(s) which received such payment shall be treated as
correspondingly reduced by the amount of such payment.

AA-79


-----

(h) Each Lender shall promptly supply to the Facility Agent such information as the Facility Agent may
from time to time request for the purpose of giving effect to this Clause 6.3 (Ancillary Facility
_Default)._

(i) If an Ancillary Facility Lender has the benefit of any Security Interest securing any of its Ancillary
Facilities, the realisations from such security when enforced will be treated as an amount recovered by
such Ancillary Facility Lender in its capacity as a Lender which is subject to the sharing arrangements
in Clause 35 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties) to the intent that such realisation should
benefit all Lenders pro rata.

**6.4 Repayment of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) No Ancillary Facility Lender may demand repayment or prepayment of any amounts under its
Ancillary Facility unless:

(i) the Revolving Facility Commitments or relevant Additional Facility Commitment (as applicable)
have been cancelled in full, or the Facility Agent has declared all Outstandings under Revolving
Facility A, Revolving Facility B or relevant Additional Facility (as applicable) immediately due
and payable; or

(ii) the Ancillary Facility Outstandings under that Ancillary Facility can be repaid by a Revolving
Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance under the relevant Additional Facility (as
applicable) (and not less than seven Business Days notice (or such shorter period as agreed to by
the Company) is given to the relevant Borrower before payment becomes due).

(b) For the purposes of repaying Ancillary Facility Outstandings (so long as paragraph (a)(i) above does
not apply) a Revolving Facility A Advance, Revolving Facility B Advance or Additional Facility
Advance (as applicable) may be borrowed irrespective of whether a Default is continuing or any other
applicable condition precedent is not satisfied.

(c) The share of the Ancillary Facility Lender in a Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility
Advance (as applicable) being used to refinance that Ancillary Facility Lender’s Ancillary Facility will
be that amount which will result (so far as possible) in:

(i) the proportion which its share of all Outstandings under Revolving Facility A, Revolving Facility
B or relevant Additional Facility (as applicable) bears to the aggregate amount of the Outstandings
under that Revolving Facility or that Additional Facility (as applicable),

being equal to:

(ii) the proportion which its Available Commitment with respect to that Revolving Facility or relevant
Additional Facility (as applicable) bears to the aggregate of the Available Commitments with
respect to that Revolving Facility or that Additional Facility (as applicable),

in each case, assuming the repayment of the relevant Ancillary Facility has taken place. The share of
the other Lenders in any such Revolving Facility A Advance, Revolving Facilty B Advance or
Additional Facility Advance (as applicable) will be adjusted accordingly.

**6.5 Continuation of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) A Borrower and an Ancillary Facility Lender may, as between themselves only, agree to continue to
provide the same banking facilities following the Termination Date applicable to Revolving Facility A,
Revolving Facility B or the Additional Facility (as applicable) or, as the case may be, the Revolving
Facility Commitments or Additional Facility Commitments (as applicable) are cancelled under this
Agreement.

(b) If any arrangement contemplated in paragraph (a) above is to occur, the relevant Borrower and the
Ancillary Facility Lender shall each confirm that to be the case in writing to the Facility Agent. Upon
such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation, any such facility shall continue as
between the said entities on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Relevant Finance
Documents. Save for any rights and obligations against any Relevant Finance Party under the Relevant
Finance Documents prior to such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation, no
such rights or obligations in respect of such Ancillary Facility shall, as between the Relevant Finance
Parties, continue and the Security shall not support any such facility in respect of any matters that arise
after such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation.

**6.6 Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Facility Lenders**

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an Ancillary Facility
Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Lender whose
(i) Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount set out opposite the relevant Lender’s name in Part 1
of Schedule 1 (Lenders and Commitments) and/or the amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment
transferred to or assumed by that Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not
cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this Agreement or (ii) Additional Facility Commitment is
the amount set out opposite the relevant Lender’s name in the relevant Additional Facility Accession
Deed and/or the amount of any relevant Additional Facility Commitment transferred to or assumed by
that Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by
it under this Agreement (as applicable). For the purposes of calculating the Lender’s Available
Commitment with respect to a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility (as applicable), the
Lender’s Commitment shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the Ancillary Facility
Commitments of its Affiliates.

(b) The Company shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any Conversion Notice delivered by
the Company to the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 6.1 (Utilisation of Ancillary Facilities).

(c) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Facility Lender shall accede to this Agreement as
an Ancillary Facility Lender, and the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor
Agreement as a Senior Lender.

(d) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and obligations to a New
Lender (in accordance with Clause 37 (Assignments and Transfers)), its Affiliate shall cease to have
any obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Facility Document.

(e) Where this Agreement or any other Relevant Finance Document imposes an obligation on an Ancillary
Facility Lender and the relevant Ancillary Facility Lender is an Affiliate of a Lender which is not a
party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

**6.7 Affiliates of Borrowers**

may with the approval of the relevant Ancillary Facility Lender become a Borrower with respect to an
Ancillary Facility.

(b) The Company shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Borrower in any Conversion Notice delivered by
the Company to the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 6.1 (Utilisation of Ancillary Facilities).

(c) If any Borrower ceases to be a Borrower under this Agreement in accordance with Clause 37.2
(Resignation of an Obligor (other than the Company)), its Affiliates, provided that any such Affiliate is
not an Affiliate of any other Obligor, shall cease to have any rights under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Facility Document.

(d) Where this Agreement or any other Relevant Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower
under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party
to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this Agreement or any other Relevant Finance Document to a Borrower being under
no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Relevant Finance Document
shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations
under any Relevant Finance Document or Ancillary Facility Document.

**7.1 Selection of Currency**

Each Borrower under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility shall select the currency of a Revolving

(a) If before the Specified Time on the Quotation Date for the relevant Revolving Facility Advance or an
Additional Facility Advance:

(i) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that the relevant Optional Currency is not readily available to
it in the amount required; or

(ii) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in that
Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance in the proposed Optional Currency
would contravene a Law or regulation applicable to it,

the Facility Agent will give notice to the relevant Borrower to that effect by the Specified Time. In this
event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this Clause 7.2 (Unavailability of Optional Currency)
will be required to participate in the relevant Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility
Advance (as applicable) in Sterling (in an amount equal to that Lender’s Proportion of the Sterling
Amount of the relevant Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance (as applicable) or,
in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender’s Proportion of the Sterling Amount of
any amount that the Lenders are actually required to advance in accordance with Clause 8.2
(Rollover)), and its participation will be treated as a separate Advance denominated in Sterling during
that Term.

any limit on the number of Advances or currencies outstanding at any one time.

requested that one or more Revolving Facility Advances or applicable Additional Facility Advances in the
same currency as the Maturing Advance be made to it (a “Rollover Advance”), subject to the Lenders being
obliged to make such Rollover Advance under Clause 4.1 (Conditions to Utilisation), the aggregate amount

that:

(a) if the amount of the Maturing Advance exceeds the aggregate amount of the Rollover Advance:

(i) the relevant Borrower will only be required to pay an amount in cash in the relevant currency
equal to that excess; and

(ii) each Lender’s participation (if any) in the Rollover Advance shall be treated as having been made
available and applied by the relevant Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender’s
participation (if any) in the Maturing Advance and that Lender will not be required to make its
participation in the Rollover Advance available in cash; and

(b) if the amount of the Maturing Advance is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the Rollover
Advance:

(i) the relevant Borrower will not be required to make any payment in cash; and

**15. INTEREST PERIODS**

**15.1 Interest Periods for Term Facility Advances**

The period for which a Term Facility Advance is outstanding shall be divided into successive periods (each
an “Interest Period”) each of which (other than the first) shall start on the last day of the preceding such
period.

**15.2 Duration**

(a) The duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise provided in this Agreement, be (x) one,
two, three or six months in respect of each Term Facility, or, in each case, such other period of up to 12
months as all the Lenders holding Commitments (in the case of the first Interest Period for a Term
Facility Advance, and thereafter, Outstandings) under the relevant Facility may agree with the
Borrower and (y) in connection with the first Term Facility Advance under any Term Facility, any
other period of six months or less as agreed to by the Borrower and the Facility Agent, in each case, as

three months; and

(ii) any Interest Period that would otherwise end during the month preceding or extend beyond a
Repayment Date relating to the Term Facility Outstandings shall be of such duration that it shall
end on that Repayment Date if necessary to ensure that there are Advances under the relevant
Term Facility with Interest Periods ending on the relevant Repayment Date in a sufficient
aggregate amount to make the repayment due on that Repayment Date.

(b) The length of an Interest Period or Term of a Term Rate Advance shall not be affected by that Term

Clause 13.2 (Delayed switch for existing Term Rate Advances).

**15.3 Consolidation and Division of Term Facility Advances**

contrary for the next Interest Period, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Term Facility
Advance on the last day of the Interest Period.

AA-97


-----

(b) Subject to the requirements of Clause 15.2 (Duration), a Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) may,
by no later than 9:30am on the date falling three Business Days before the first day of the relevant
Interest Period, direct that any Term Facility Advance borrowed by it shall, at the beginning of the next
Interest Period relating to it, be divided into (and thereafter, save as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, be treated in all respects as) two or more Advances in such amounts (equal in aggregate to
the Sterling Amount of the Term Facility Advance being so divided) as shall be specified by that
Borrower or the Company in such notice provided that no such direction may be made if:

(i) as a result of so doing, there would be more than 10 Advances outstanding under the relevant
Term Facility; or

(ii) any Term Facility Advance thereby coming into existence would have a Sterling Amount of less
than £25,000,000.

**16. MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES**

**16.1 Interest calculation if no Primary Term Rate**

(a) _Interpolated Primary Term Rate: If no Primary Term Rate is available for the Interest Period or Term_
of a Term Rate Advance, the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be the Interpolated Primary Term
Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance.

(b) _Shortened Interest Period: If paragraph (a) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the_
Interpolated Primary Term Rate, the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance shall (if it is
longer than the applicable Fallback Interest Period) be shortened to the applicable Fallback Interest
Period and the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be determined pursuant to the definition of
“Primary Term Rate”.

(c) _Shortened Interest Period and Historic Primary Term Rate: If paragraph (b) applies but no Primary_
Term Rate is available for the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance and it is not possible
to calculate the Interpolated Primary Term Rate, the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be the Historic
Primary Term Rate for that Term Rate Advance.

(d) _Shortened Interest Period and Interpolated Historic Primary Term Rate: If paragraph (c) above applies_
but no Historic Primary Term Rate is available for the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate
Advance, the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be the Interpolated Historic Primary Term Rate for a
period equal in length to the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance.

(e) _Alternative Term Rate: In relation to a Term Rate Advance that is not a Euro Term Rate Advance, if_
paragraph (d) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Historic Primary Term
Rate, the Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance shall, if it has been shortened pursuant to
paragraph (b) above, revert to its previous length and, the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be the
aggregate of:

(i) the applicable Alternative Term Rate as of the Quotation Time for a period equal in length to the
Interest Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance; and

(ii) any applicable Alternative Term Rate Adjustment.

(f) _Interpolated Alternative Term Rate: In relation to a Term Rate Advance that is not a Euro Term Rate_
Advance, if paragraph (e) above applies but no Alternative Term Rate is available for the Interest
Period or Term of that Term Rate Advance, the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be the aggregate
of:

(i) the Interpolated Alternative Term Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period or Term
of that Term Rate Advance; and

(ii) any applicable Alternative Term Rate Adjustment.

(g) _Alternative Fallback Rate: In relation to a Term Rate Advance that is not a Euro Term Rate Advance, if_
there is no Alternative Term Rate specified in the applicable Reference Rate Terms or paragraph
(f) above applies, and the Company and the Facility Agent (in its sole discretion and, for the avoidance
of doubt, without any requirement to consult with or seek any consent or instruction from the Lenders
or any other Finance Party), each acting reasonably, have determined that:

(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Interpolated Historic Primary
Term Rate and/or Interpolated Alternative Term Rate (as applicable) for the Interest Period or

AA-98


-----

Term of a Term Rate Advance because neither the Primary Term Rate nor the Alternative Term
Rate (if any) is available or published on a current basis for a relevant tenor and such
circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or

(ii) neither the Primary Term Rate nor the Alternative Term Rate (if any) will be made available or
permitted to be used for determining the interest rate applicable to such Term Rate Advance,

then, on the Alternative Fallback Rate Date the applicable Term Reference Rate in relation to such
Term Rate Advance shall be the aggregate of:

(A) the Alternative Fallback Rate; and

(B) any applicable Alternative Fallback Rate Adjustment,

to be calculated by the Facility Agent in a manner consistent with prevailing market practice,
provided that if the sum of the Alternative Fallback Rate and the Alternative Fallback Rate
Adjustment would be less than zero, in the case of an Advance under Additional Facility N or
Additional Facility Q, it shall be deemed to be zero, and in the case of any other Additional
Facility, any other adjustment specified in the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed shall
be made, provided further that to the extent such prevailing market practice is not administratively
feasible for the Facility Agent, the Alternative Fallback Rate shall be applied in a manner as
otherwise reasonably determined by the Facility Agent (in its sole discretion and, for the
avoidance of doubt, without any requirement to consult with or seek any consent or instruction
from the Lenders or any other Finance Party) in consultation with the Company.

(h) _Reference Bank Rate for Euro Term Rate Advances: In relation to a Euro Term Rate Advance, if_
paragraph (d) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Historic Primary Term
Rate, the Interest Period or Term of that Euro Term Rate Advance shall, if it has been shortened
pursuant to paragraph (b) above, revert to its previous length and the applicable Primary Term Rate
shall be the Reference Bank Rate as of the Specified Time for euros and for a period equal in length to
the Interest Period or Term of that Euro Term Rate Advance.

(i) _Alternative Reference Bank Rate for Euro Term Rate Advances: In relation to a Euro Term Rate_
Advance, if paragraph (h) above applies but no Reference Bank Rate is available for euros or the
relevant Interest Period or Term, the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be the Alternative Reference
Bank Rate as of the Specified Time for euros and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period or
Term of that Euro Term Rate Advance.

(j) _Cost of funds for Euro Term Rate Advances: In relation to a Euro Term Rate Advance, if paragraph_
(i) above applies but no Alternative Reference Bank Rate is available for euros or the relevant Interest
Period or Term there shall be no Primary Term Rate for that Term Rate Advance and Clause 16.4 (Cost
_of funds) shall apply to that Euro Term Rate Advance for that Interest Period or Term._

**16.2 Calculation of Reference Bank Rate and Alternative Reference Bank Rate**

In relation to Euro Term Rate Advances, the calculation of the Reference Bank Rate and Alternative
Reference Bank Rate shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) subject to paragraph (b) below, if the Primary Term Rate is to be determined on the basis of a
Reference Bank Rate but a Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the Specified Time the
Reference Bank Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference
Banks;

(b) if at or about noon on the Quotation Date none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a
quotation, there shall be no Reference Bank Rate for the relevant Interest Period or Term;

(c) subject to paragraph (d) below, if the Primary Term Rate is to be determined on the basis of an
Alternative Reference Bank Rate but an Alternative Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the
Specified Time, the Alternative Reference Bank Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations
of the remaining Alternative Reference Banks; and

(d) if before close of business in London on the date falling one Business Day after the Quotation Date
none or only one of the Alternative Reference Banks supplies a quotation, there shall be no Alternative
Reference Bank Rate for the relevant Interest Period or Term.

AA-99


-----

**16.3 Market disruption**

(a) If the Primary Term Rate is determined otherwise than on the basis of an Alternative Reference Bank
Rate and before close of business in London on the Quotation Date for the relevant Interest Period or
Term, the Facility Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in a
Euro Term Rate Advance exceed 40 per cent. of that Euro Term Rate Advance) that the cost to it of
funding its participation in that Euro Term Rate Advance from whatever source it may reasonably
select would be in excess of the Primary Term Rate then the applicable Primary Term Rate shall be the
Alternative Reference Bank Rate as of the Specified Time for the currency of that Euro Term Rate
Advance and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period or Term of that Euro Term Rate
Advance and if no Alternative Reference Bank Rate is available for the relevant currency or Interest
Period or Term there shall be no Primary Term Rate for that Euro Term Rate Advance and Clause 16.4
(Cost of funds) shall apply to that Euro Term Rate Advance for the relevant Interest Period or Term.

(b) If the Primary Term Rate is determined on the basis of an Alternative Reference Bank Rate and before
close of business in London on the date falling one Business Day after the Quotation Date for the
relevant Interest Period or Term of the relevant Euro Term Rate Advance the Facility Agent receives
notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in that Euro Term Rate Advance exceed
40 per cent. of that Euro Term Rate Advance) that the cost to it of funding its participation in that Euro
Term Rate Advance from whatever source it may reasonably select would be in excess of the Primary
Term Rate then Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Euro Term Rate Advance for the
relevant Interest Period or Term.

**16.4 Cost of funds**

(a) If this Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) applies in relation to a Euro Term Rate Advance, the rate of interest
on each Lender’s share of such Euro Term Rate Advance for the relevant Interest Period or Term shall
be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of:

(i) the Margin; and

(ii) the rate notified to the Facility Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in any event within
one Business Day of the first day of that Interest Period or Term (or, if earlier, on the date falling
five Business Days before the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest
Period or Term), to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant
Lender of funding its participation in that Term Rate Advance from whatever source it may
reasonably select.

(b) If this Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) applies or if the Primary Term Rate is to be determined on the basis
of a Reference Bank Rate or Alternative Reference Bank Rate and the Facility Agent or the Company
so requires, the Facility Agent (acting in its sole discretion and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any
requirement to consult with or seek any consent or instruction from the Lenders or any other Finance
Party) and the Company shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty days) with a
view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

(c) Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall, with the prior consent of the
Facility Agent (acting in its sole discretion and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any requirement to
consult with or seek any consent or instruction from the Lenders or any other Finance Party) and the
Company, be binding on all Parties.

(d) If this Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) applies in relation to a Euro Term Rate Advance pursuant to Clause
16.3 (Market disruption) and:

(i) a Lender’s Funding Rate is less than the Primary Term Rate; or

(ii) a Lender does not supply a quotation by the time specified in paragraph (a)(ii) above,

the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Euro Term Rate Advance for that Interest
Period or Term shall be deemed, for the purposes of paragraph (a) above, to be the Primary Term Rate.

(e) If this Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) applies to a Euro Term Rate Advance pursuant to Clause 16.1
(Interest calculation if no Primary Term Rate) but any Lender does not supply a quotation by the time
specified in paragraph (a)(ii) above the rate of interest for that Lender will be the weighted average of
the quotations notified to the Facility Agent by the other Lenders.

**16.5 Notification to Company**

If Clause 16.4 (Cost of funds) applies or if the Primary Term Rate is to be determined on the basis of an
Alternative Reference Bank Rate, the Facility Agent shall, as soon as is practicable, notify the Company.

**17. COMMISSIONS AND FEES**

**17.1 Commitment Fees**

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, the Company shall pay (or procure the payment of) to the Facility Agent

40 per cent. of the Revolving Facility B Margin and shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each
successive period of three months which ends during such period and on the Termination Date for
Revolving Facility B.

(c) No commitment fee is payable to the Facility Agent (for the account of a Lender) on any Available
Revolving Facility Commitment of that Lender for any day on which that Lender is a Defaulting
Lender.

(d) Any commitment fee in respect of the Original Revolving Facility which accrued to a Lender prior to
the 2023 Second Amendment and Restatement Date shall be deemed to have accrued under Revolving
Facility A if such Lender is a Lender under Revolving Facility A as of the 2023 Second Amendment
and Restatement Date and shall be deemed to have accrued under Revolving Facility B if such Lender

which the relevant Documentary Credit is denominated at a rate equal to the Revolving Facility Margin
applied on the Outstanding L/C Amount in relation to such Documentary Credit (less any amount which has
been repaid or prepaid). Such documentary credit fee shall be paid in arrears on each Quarter Date during
the Term of the relevant Documentary Credit and on the relevant Expiry Date (or the date of its repayment,
prepayment or cancellation, if earlier) for that Documentary Credit.

**18. TAXES**

**18.1 Tax Gross-up**

(a) Each payment made by the Parent or an Obligor under a Relevant Finance Document shall be made by
it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by Law. Any Tax Deduction in
relation to any payment due in any currency other than Sterling shall be calculated using the Facility
Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange on the date such payment is made and the Parent and the Obligors shall
have no liability if any subsequent credit or refund received by any Lender from any tax authority in
relation thereto is in a different amount (when converted to the non-Sterling currency on any date).

(b) As soon as it becomes aware that the Parent or an Obligor is or will be required by Law to make a Tax
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate at which or the basis on which such Tax Deduction is
to be made) the Parent or the relevant Obligor shall notify the Facility Agent accordingly. Similarly, a
Lender shall notify the Facility Agent and the Parent upon becoming so aware in respect of a payment
payable to that Lender.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Parent or an Obligor, the amount of the
payment due shall, unless paragraph (f) below applies, be increased to an amount so that, after the
required Tax Deduction is made, the payee receives an amount equal to the amount it would have
received had no Tax Deduction been required.

(d) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee (other
than by reason of the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee performing its obligations as such under
this Agreement through an office located outside the United Kingdom) from any payment to any
Relevant Finance Party which represents an amount or amounts received from the Parent or an Obligor,
either the Parent or that Obligor, as the case may be, shall, unless paragraph (f) below applies, pay
directly to that Relevant Finance Party an amount which, after making the required Tax Deduction
enables the payee of that amount to receive an amount equal to the payment which it would have
received if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(e) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee from
any payment to any Relevant Finance Party under paragraph (d) above, the Facility Agent or the
Security Trustee as appropriate shall unless paragraph (g) below applies, make that Tax Deduction and
any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction to the relevant taxing authority within the
time allowed and in the minimum amount required by Law and within 30 days of making either a Tax
Deduction or any payment in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Facility Agent or the Security
Trustee, as appropriate, making that Tax Deduction or other payment shall deliver to the relevant
Borrower evidence that the Tax Deduction or other payment has been made or accounted for to the
relevant tax authority.

(f) Neither the Parent nor any Obligor is required to make a Tax Payment to a Lender under paragraphs
(c) or (d) above for a Tax Deduction in respect of tax imposed by the United Kingdom on a payment of
interest by a UK Borrower in respect of a participation in an Advance by that Lender to any UK
Borrower where that Lender is not a Qualifying UK Lender on the date on which the relevant payment
of interest is due (otherwise than as a consequence of a Change in Tax Law) to the extent that payment
could have been made without a Tax Deduction if that Lender had been a Qualifying UK Lender on
that date.

(g) The Parent or the relevant Obligor (as the case may be) which is required to make a Tax Deduction
shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction to the
relevant tax authority within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by Law.

(h) Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax
Deduction, either the Parent or the relevant Obligor making that Tax Deduction or other payment shall
deliver to the Facility Agent for the Relevant Finance Party entitled to the interest to which such Tax
Deduction or payment relates, evidence that the Tax Deduction or other payment has been made or
accounted for to the relevant tax authority.

-----

(i) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment
required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any
payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient
of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

**18.2 Lender Tax Status**

(a) Each Lender to any UK Borrower represents and warrants to the Facility Agent and to each UK
Borrower:

(i) in the case of a Lender under Revolving Facility A as at the 2023 Second Amendment and
Restatement Date, that as at the 2021 First Amendment and Restatement Date, it has the tax status
set out opposite its name in Part 2: of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax Status);

(ii) in the case of a Lender under Revolving Facility B as at the 2023 Second Amendment and
Restatement Date, that as at the 2023 Second Amendment and Restatement Date, it has the tax
status set out opposite its name in Part 2: of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax Status); or

(iii) in the case of any other Lender, that as at the relevant Transfer Date, Increase Date or the date of
the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed, it is:

(A) a UK Bank Lender;

(B) a UK Non-Bank Lender and falls within paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition thereof;

(C) a UK Treaty Lender; or

(D) not a Qualifying UK Lender,

as the same shall be expressly indicated in the relevant Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Increase
Confirmation or Additional Facility Accession Deed.

(b)

(i) Each Lender expressed to be a “UK Non-Bank Lender” in Part 2: of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax
_Status) or in the Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Additional Facility Accession Deed or_
Increase Confirmation pursuant to which it becomes a Lender represents and warrants to:

(A) the Facility Agent and each UK Borrower, on the 2021 First Amendment and Restatement
Date (in the case of a Lender under Revolving Facility A) or on the 2023 Third Amendment
and Restatement Date (in the case of a Lender under Revolving Facility B), or on the relevant
Transfer Date, Increase Date or the date of the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed
(as the case may be) that it is within paragraph (a) of the definition of UK Non-Bank Lender
on that date (unless, if it is not within such paragraph (a), it is within paragraph (b) of such
definition on that date, and has notified the Facility Agent of the circumstances by virtue of
which it falls within such paragraph (b) and has provided evidence of the same to the
Company if and to the extent requested to do so, by the Facility Agent or the Company); and

(B) the Facility Agent and each UK Borrower, that unless it notifies the Facility Agent and the
Company to the contrary in writing prior to any such date, its representation and warranty in
paragraph (A) above is true in relation to that Lender’s participation in each Advance made
to such Borrowers, on each date that such UK Borrower makes a payment of interest in
relation to such Advance.

(c) (i) A Lender under Revolving Facility A or Revolving Facility B on the 2023 Third Amendment and
Restatement Date that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and which
wishes that Scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the
benefit of the Facility Agent and without liability to any Parent Entity or any Obligor) by
including its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in
Part 2: of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax Status).

(ii) A New Lender, an Additional Facility Lender or an Increase Lender that holds a passport under
the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and which wishes that Scheme to apply to this
Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of the Facility Agent and
without liability to any Parent Entity or any Obligor) by including its scheme reference number
and its jurisdiction of tax residence in the Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Additional Facility
Accession Deed or Increase Confirmation which it executes.

AA-103


-----

(iii) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in
accordance with paragraph (c)(i) or (c)(ii) above, then neither any Parent Entity nor any Obligor
shall make any filing under or in relation to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme in respect of
that Lender’s Commitment(s) or its participation in any Advance unless that Lender otherwise
agrees.

(iv) The Parent or the relevant Obligor that makes a payment to which that Lender is entitled shall
cooperate with the Lender in completing any procedural formalities as may be necessary for either
the Parent or the relevant Obligor to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a Tax
Deduction (including where a Lender includes the indication described in paragraphs (c)(i) or
(c)(ii) above, filing with HMRC, within any applicable time limit, a form DTTP2 or such
equivalent or other HMRC form(s) as may be required to be filed pursuant to the HMRC DT
Treaty Passport Scheme in respect of that Lender, completed in accordance with the information
provided by that Lender); provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph (c)(iv) shall require a
Lender to disclose any confidential information or information regarding its business, tax affairs
or tax computations (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its calculations).

(d) (i) If, in relation to any interest payment to a Lender on an Advance made to a UK Borrower:

(A) that Lender has confirmed to the relevant UK Borrower and to the Facility Agent before that
interest payment would otherwise fall due that:

(1) it has completed, where applicable, the necessary procedural formalities referred to in,
and otherwise complied with, paragraph (c) above; and

(2) H.M. Revenue & Customs has not declined to issue the authorisation referred to in the
definition of “UK Treaty Lender” (the “Authorisation”) in respect of that Lender in
relation to that Advance, or if H.M. Revenue & Customs has declined, the Lender is
disputing that decision in good faith; and

(B) the relevant UK Borrower has not received the Authorisation,

then, such Lender may elect, by not less than five Business Days prior confirmation in writing to
the Facility Agent, that such interest payment (the “Relevant Interest Payment”) shall not be due
and payable under Clause 14.3 (Payment of Interest – Term Rate Advances) or Clause 14.4
(Payment of Interest – Compounded Rate Advances) (as applicable) until the date (the
“Confirmation Date”) which is five Business Days after the earlier of:

(C) the date on which the Authorisation is received by the relevant UK Borrower;

(D) the date that Lender confirms to the relevant UK Borrower and the Facility Agent that it is
not entitled to claim full relief from liability to taxation otherwise imposed by the United
Kingdom (in relation to that Lender’s participation in Advances made to that UK Borrower)
on interest under a Double Taxation Treaty in relation to the Relevant Interest Payment; and

(E) the earlier of (1) the date which is six months after the date on which the Relevant Interest
Payment had otherwise been due and payable and (2) the date of final repayment (whether
scheduled, voluntary or mandatory) of principal in respect of the Relevant Interest Payment.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that paragraph (i) above applies, the Interest Period or
Term to which the Relevant Interest Payment relates shall not be extended and the start of the
immediately succeeding Interest Period or Term shall not be delayed.

(e) Any Lender which was either:

(i) a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently ceases to be a Qualifying UK
Lender; or

(ii) not a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently becomes a Qualifying UK
Lender,

(in each case, other than by reason of a Change in Tax Law in the United Kingdom) shall promptly
notify the UK Borrowers of that event, provided that if there is a Change in Tax Law in the United
Kingdom which in the reasonable opinion of such UK Borrowers may result in any Lender which was,
either: (i) a Qualifying UK Lender when it became a Party ceasing to be a Qualifying UK Lender, or
(ii) not a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently becomes a Qualifying UK
Lender, such Qualifying UK Lender or non-Qualifying UK Lender (as applicable) shall co-operate with

AA-104


-----

such UK Borrowers and provide reasonable evidence requested by such UK Borrowers in order for
such UK Borrowers to determine whether such Lender has ceased to be a Qualifying UK Lender or
became a Qualifying UK Lender (as applicable) provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph
(e) shall require a Lender to disclose any confidential information or information regarding its
business, tax affairs or tax computations (including without limitation, its tax returns or its
calculations).

(f) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) to (e) above, each Lender shall promptly deliver such documents
evidencing its corporate and tax status as the Facility Agent or the Company may reasonably request,
provided that in the event that any Lender fails to comply with the foregoing requirement, any UK
Borrower shall be permitted:

(i) to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the applicable withholding tax estimated in good
faith by the Borrower to be required to be withheld in respect of interest payable to such Lender;
or

(ii) subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of Clause 37.4 (Assignments or Transfers by Lenders),
to refuse to grant its consent to such transfer.

(g) In the event that either the Facility Agent or the Company has reason to believe that any representation
given by a Lender in accordance with this Clause 18.2 (Lender Tax Status) is incorrect or inaccurate,
the Facility Agent or the Company (as the case may be) shall promptly inform the other party and the
relevant Lender, and may thereafter request such documents relating to the corporate and tax status of
such Lender as the Facility Agent or the Company may reasonably require for the purposes of
determining whether or not such representation was indeed incorrect.

(h) If, following delivery of such documentation and following consultation between the Facility Agent,
the Company and the relevant Lender, the Company concludes (acting reasonably and in good faith)
that there is insufficient evidence to determine the relevant tax status of such Lender, the UK Borrower
shall be permitted in respect of such Lender, to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the
applicable withholding tax estimated in good faith by the UK Borrower to be required to be withheld in
respect of interest payable to such Lender until such time as that Lender has delivered sufficient
evidence of its tax status to the Facility Agent and the Company.

(i) Each Relevant Finance Party shall confirm whether it is entitled to receive payments under the
Relevant Finance Documents free from withholding under FATCA and shall provide any
documentation, forms and other information relating to its status under FATCA reasonably requested
by the Facility Agent or a Borrower sufficient for the Facility Agent and the Borrowers to comply with
their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Relevant Finance Party has complied
with such applicable reporting requirements.

(j) Solely in the case of a Tax Deduction imposed by a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 18 (Taxes):

(i) any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to
payments made by a Borrower under any Relevant Finance Document shall deliver to the
Borrowers and the Facility Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or
the Facility Agent (and promptly after the occurrence of a change in the Lender’s circumstance
requiring a change in the most recent documentation previously delivered), such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility
Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
withholding; and

(ii) any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Facility Agent, shall deliver such
other documentation prescribed by an applicable requirement of law or reasonably requested by
the Borrowers or the Facility Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Facility Agent to
determine whether or not such Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation shall not be required if in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any
material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial
position of such Lender. In the event that any Lender fails to comply with the foregoing
requirement, any Borrower shall be permitted to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the
applicable withholding tax (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any withholding tax imposed by

AA-105


-----

the United Kingdom) estimated in good faith by the Borrowers to be required to be withheld in
respect of interest payable to such Lender. Neither any Parent Entity nor any Obligor is required to
make a Tax Payment to a Lender under paragraphs (c) or (d) above to the extent such taxes are
attributable to a failure by a Lender to provide the documentation required to be delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this Clause 18.2(j) (Lender Tax Status). For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Clause 18.2(j) (Lender Tax Status) shall be understood to affect the rights of
Lenders to a gross-up in respect of a Tax Deduction levied in the United Kingdom, but only to the
extent permitted under Clause 18.1 (Tax Gross-up).

**18.3 Tax Indemnity**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Company shall (within 10 Business Days of written demand by the
Facility Agent) pay (or procure that either the Parent or the relevant Obligor pays) for the account of a
Protected Party an amount equal to any Tax Liability which that Protected Party reasonably determines
has been or will be suffered by that Protected Party (directly or indirectly) in connection with any
Relevant Finance Document. The Protected Party shall within five Business Days’ of request by the
Company provide to the Company reasonable written details explaining the loss, liability or cost and
the calculation of the amount claimed by the Protected Party.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(i) with respect to any Tax Liability of a Protected Party in respect of Tax on Overall Net Income of
that Protected Party;

(ii) to the extent that any Tax Liability has been compensated for by an increased payment or other
payment under paragraphs (c) or (d) of Clause 18.1 (Tax Gross-up) or would have been
compensated for by such an increased payment or other payment, but for the application of
paragraph (f) of Clause 18.1 (Tax Gross-up);

(iii) with respect to any Tax Liability which relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a
Party;

(iv) to the extent that any Tax Liability has been compensated for by a payment under Clause 38.4
(Stamp Duties) or would have been compensated for by such payment, but for an exception in
such Clause; or

(v) to the extent that any Tax Liability is suffered or incurred by a Finance Party in respect of a Bank
Levy.

(c) A Protected Party making, or intending to make, a claim pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall
promptly notify the Facility Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim together
with supporting evidence, following which the Facility Agent shall notify the Company and provide
such evidence to it.

(d) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from either the Parent or an Obligor under this Clause
18.3 (Tax Indemnity), notify the Facility Agent.

(e) In this Clause 18.3 (Tax Indemnity):

“Tax Liability” means, in respect of any Protected Party:

(i) any liability or any increase in the liability of that person to make any payment of or in respect of
tax;

(ii) any loss of any relief, allowance, deduction or credit in respect of tax which would otherwise have
been available to that person;

(iii) any setting off against income, profits or gains or against any tax liability of any relief, allowance,
deduction or credit in respect of tax which would otherwise have been available to that person;
and

(iv) any loss or setting off against any tax liability of a right to repayment of tax which would
otherwise have been available to that person.

For this purpose, any question of whether or not any relief, allowance, deduction, credit or right to
repayment of tax has been lost or set off in relation to any person, and if so, the date on which that loss
or set off took place, shall be conclusively determined by that person, acting reasonably and in good
faith and such determination shall be binding on the relevant Parties.

AA-106


-----

“Tax on Overall Net Income” means, in relation to a Protected Party, tax (other than tax deducted or
withheld from any payment) imposed on the net income received or receivable (but not any sum
deemed to be received or receivable) by that Protected Party by the jurisdiction in which the Relevant
Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the Relevant
Finance Party is treated as residing for tax purposes or in which the Relevant Finance Party’s Facility
Office or head office is situated.

**18.4 Tax Credit**

(a) If either the Parent or an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the Relevant Finance Party determines, in
its sole opinion, that:

(i) a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment; and

(ii) that Relevant Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,

the Relevant Finance Party shall (subject to paragraph (b) below and to the extent that such Relevant
Finance Party can do so without prejudicing the availability and/or the amount of the Tax Credit and
the right of that Relevant Finance Party to obtain any other benefit, relief or allowance which may be
available to it) pay to either the Parent or the relevant Obligor such amount which that Relevant
Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax
position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Parent or
the relevant Obligor.

(b) Each Relevant Finance Party shall have an absolute discretion as to the time at which and the order and
manner in which it realises or utilises any Tax Credits and shall not be obliged to arrange its business
or its tax affairs in any particular way in order to be eligible for any credit or refund or similar benefit.

(c) No Relevant Finance Party shall be obliged to disclose to any other person any information regarding
its business, tax affairs or tax computations (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its
calculations).

(d) If a Relevant Finance Party has made a payment to the Parent or an Obligor pursuant to this Clause
18.4 (Tax Credit) on account of a Tax Credit and it subsequently transpires that Relevant Finance Party
did not receive that Tax Credit, or received a reduced Tax Credit, either the Parent or such Obligor, as
the case may be, shall, on demand, pay to that Relevant Finance Party the amount which that Relevant
Finance Party determines, acting reasonably and in good faith, will put it (after that payment is
received) in the same after-tax position as it would have been in had no such payment or a reduced
payment been made to the Parent or such Obligor.

(e) No Relevant Finance Party shall be obliged to make any payment under this Clause 18.4 (Tax Credit)
if, by doing so, it would contravene the terms of any applicable Law or any notice, direction or
requirement of any governmental or regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law).

**19. INCREASED COSTS**

**19.1 Increased Costs**

Subject to Clause 19.3 (Exceptions), the Company shall, within ten Business Days of a demand by the
Facility Agent, pay (or procure the payment of) for the account of a Relevant Finance Party the amount of
any Increased Cost incurred by that Relevant Finance Party or any of its Affiliates as a result (direct or
indirect) of:

(a) the introduction or implementation of or any change in (or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application of) any Law, regulation, practice or concession or any directive,
requirement, request or guideline (whether or not having the force of law but where such law,
regulation, practice, concession, directive, requirement, request or guideline does not have the force of
law, it is one with which banks or financial institutions subject to the same are generally accustomed to
comply) of any central bank, including the European Central Bank, the Financial Conduct Authority or
any other fiscal, monetary, regulatory or other authority after the later of the date upon which (i) the
Relevant Finance Party which has incurred any Increased Cost which is the subject of this Clause
becomes a Party in accordance with the provisions this Agreement, or (ii) in the case of a Lender where
the Facility under which such Lender initially had a Commitment when it became a Party has been
cancelled, the first day of the Availability Period for the Facility under which such Lender has a

AA-107


-----

Commitment (it being acknowledged that, where such Lender has Commitments under more than one
Facility and such Facilities’ Availability Periods commenced on different dates, the relevant date shall
be the earlier of the dates); or

(b) compliance with any Law, regulation, practice, concession or any such directive, requirement, request
or guideline made after the later of the date upon which (i) the Relevant Finance Party which has
incurred any Increased Cost which is the subject of this Clause becomes a Party in accordance with the
provisions this Agreement, or (ii) in the case of a Lender where the Facility under which such Lender
initially had a Commitment when it became a Party has been cancelled, the first day of the Availability
Period for the Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment (it being acknowledged that, where
such Lender has Commitments under more than one Facility and such Facilities’ Availability Periods
commenced on different dates, the relevant date shall be the earlier of the dates).

**19.2 Increased Costs Claims**

(a) A Relevant Finance Party intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 19.1 (Increased Costs) shall, as
soon as is reasonably practicable after that Relevant Finance Party becomes aware that circumstances
have arisen which entitle it to make such claim, notify the Facility Agent of the event giving rise to the
claim, following which the Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Company.

(b) Each Relevant Finance Party shall, as soon as practicable after a demand by the Facility Agent, provide
a certificate (giving reasonable details of the circumstances giving rise to such claim and of the
calculation of the Increased Cost) confirming (i) the amount of its Increased Costs or, if applicable, the
Increased Costs of any of its Affiliates, (ii) that it is its policy or current practice to seek to recover
such Increased Costs to a similar extent from other similar borrowers in relation to similar existing
facilities (such similarity, in each case, determined by reference to the treatment of borrowers and
facilities under the law or regulation giving rise to the relevant Increased Cost) and (iii) that it had not
already taken such Increased Costs into account as part of its fees and pricing in connection with the
Facilities, a copy of which shall be provided to the Company at the same time as such certificate is
delivered to the Facility Agent, provided that no Relevant Finance Party shall be required to disclose
information it is not legally allowed to disclose or in respect of which it is bound by contractual
requirements of confidentiality or which is otherwise price-sensitive information prohibited from being
disclosed pursuant to applicable law or regulation.

net income of the Relevant Finance Party (or any Affiliate of it) or of the branch or office through
which it lends any Advance;

procuring that:

(i) additional equity is injected into, and/or additional Subordinated Funding is provided to,
one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than
the amount which if it had been deducted from Total Net Debt for the Ratio Period in
respect of which the breach arose, would have avoided the breach;

(ii) additional equity is injected into, and/or additional Subordinated Funding is provided to,
one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than
the amount which if it had been added to EBITDA for the Ratio Period in respect of which
the breach arose, would have avoided the breach;

(iii) Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to
an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any
Ancillary Facility are prepaid (from any source selected by the Company in its sole
discretion) in an amount which if such prepayment had occurred immediately prior to the
calculation on the last day of the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose, the
Financial Ratio Test Condition as at the last day of that Ratio Period would have not been
met and therefore the financial ratio would not have been required to be tested;

(iv) non-cash assets are contributed to one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate
amount (determined by reference to such non-cash assets’ fair market value (as determined
by the Company in good faith)) equal to or greater than the amount which if it had been
deducted from Total Net Debt for the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose,
would have avoided the breach; or

(v) non-cash assets are contributed to one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate
amount (determined by reference to such non-cash assets’ EBITDA (as determined by the
Company in good faith)) equal to or greater than the amount which if it had been added to
EBITDA for the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose, would have avoided the
breach.

(b) A cure under this Clause 23.4 (Cure provisions) will not be effective unless:

(i) in the case of paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iv) and (a)(v) above, an amount equal to or
greater than the required amount of additional equity, the proceeds of any Subordinated
Funding, the EBITDA of the non-cash assets or the amount of non-cash assets (as
applicable) are received by one or more members of the Bank Group; or

(ii) in the case of paragraph (a)(iii) above, the amount of the Revolving Facility Outstandings
and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to an Additional Facility that is a
revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any Ancillary Facility that are required to
be prepaid are so prepaid,

in each case, within 30 Business Days of delivery of the financial statements delivered under Clause
24.2 (Financial information) which show that Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio) has been breached (the
“Cure Period”).

(c) No cure may be made under this Clause 23.4 (Cure provisions):

(i) in respect of more than five Ratio Periods during the life of the Additional Facilities; or

(ii) in respect of consecutive Ratio Periods.

(d) The Company shall make an election (at its sole discretion) by notice to the Facility Agent prior to the
end of the Cure Period as to whether a breach of the financial ratio set out in Clause 23.2 (Financial
_Ratio) shall be cured pursuant to a recalculation as described in either sub-paragraph (a)(i), (a)(ii),_
(a)(iii), (a)(iv) or (a)(v) above.

(e) If the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in sub-paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii),
(a)(iv) or (a)(v) above, it shall be under no obligation to apply the amount of additional equity, the
proceeds of any Subordinated Funding, the EBITDA of non-cash assets or the amount of non-cash
assets that are received by one or more members of the Bank Group in prepayment of the Facilities or
for any other specific purpose and such amount will be deemed to be deducted from Total Net Debt or
added to EBITDA for the purposes of Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio) (as applicable) as at the last day
of the relevant Ratio Period.

AA-120

(f) If the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in sub-paragraph (a)(iii) above, the
amount of the Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation
to an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any Ancillary
Facility that are prepaid shall be deemed to be deducted in the calculation of the Financial Ratio Test
Condition for the purposes of Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio) as at the last day of the relevant Ratio
Period.

(g) For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio), the Financial Ratio
Test Condition and the ratio set out in Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio), will be tested or retested, as
applicable, giving effect to the elections and adjustments referred to in paragraph (d), (e) and
(f) above. If, after giving effect to such elections and adjustments, the requirements of Clause 23.2
(Financial Ratio) are met, then the requirements under Clause 23.2 (Financial Ratio) shall be deemed
to have been satisfied as at the relevant original date of determination.

(h) Where a cure is exercised under this Clause 23.4 in respect of a breach of Clause 23.2 (Financial
_Ratio) for any financial quarter and the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in_
sub-paragraph (a)(ii) or (a)(v) above, the amount of additional equity, the proceeds of any
Subordinated Funding or the EBITDA of the non-cash assets (as applicable) that are received by one
or more members of the Bank Group shall also be added in calculating EBITDA for any future Ratio
Period that includes such financial quarter. Any Adjustments pursuant to this paragraph will not be

with respect to which substantial steps have been taken, by the Company or any other member of the
Bank Group in connection with any cost reduction synergies or cost savings plan or program or in

most recent Ratio Period for which financial statements have been delivered to the Facility Agent

any person or asset the Annualised EBITDA of or attributable to which does not exceed the
Remaining Percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group for the Latest Ratio
Period, provided that:

(A) no Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result of such disposal;
and

(B) where required, a prepayment is made in accordance with Clause 12.2(a) (Mandatory
_prepayment from disposal proceeds) in respect of such disposal; and_

(li) a disposal of any person or asset otherwise pursuant to paragraph (l) provided that:

(A) if, at the time of such disposal, any member of the Bank Group has contractually
committed or agreed to a future Acquisition and such an Acquisition occurs within 12
months (or less) of the disposal; and

(B) the Remaining Percentage (as defined in paragraph (c) below) would not be exceeded
if the aggregate percentage value of the contemplated Acquisition is added to the
calculation and tested at the time of the disposal on a pro forma basis (giving effect to
the Annualised EBITDA (as defined in paragraph (d) below) of the Target based on
then available historical financial information) and on an actual basis at the completion
of the Acquisition (and for these purposes the proviso in paragraph (c) below shall be
disapplied so that the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group
represented by the Annualised EBITDA of the relevant disposal could be more than the
Remaining Percentage immediately prior to such disposal provided that the Remaining
Percentage would not be exceeded once any contemplated Acquisition is taken into
account as described in this paragraph (li)).

(c) The “Remaining Percentage” is:

(i) 17.5 per cent;

(ii) less the aggregate Percentage Value of all previous disposals made after the Signing Date;

(iii) and plus the aggregate Percentage Value of all Reinvestments made,

as calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) below,

**provided that the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group represented by the**
Annualised EBITDA of the person or asset disposed of can never be more than the Remaining
Percentage immediately prior to such disposal.

(d) For the purposes of paragraphs (b)(l), (b)(li) and (c) above:

“Annualised EBITDA” and “EBITDA” have the meaning given to them in Clause 23.1 (Financial
_definitions) but, when calculating EBITDA in relation to a person or asset that is being (or has been)_
acquired or disposed of, any amounts will be calculated using the methodology for calculating operating
cash flow used in the accounts most recently filed with the SEC by or on behalf of the Ultimate Parent
prior to the date of that acquisition or disposal, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any corporate costs or
allocations paid or payable during the relevant period by a member of the Bank Group which is being
disposed of to one of its Affiliates pursuant to any general services (or similar) arrangement shall be
deducted from the EBITDA of the member of the Bank Group being disposed of.

“Latest Ratio Period” means the most recent Ratio Period for which financial statements have been
delivered pursuant to Clause 24.2 (Financial information).

“Percentage Value” means:

(a) in relation to a disposal, the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group for what was
the Latest Ratio Period at the time of the disposal which is represented by the Annualised EBITDA of
the person or asset disposed of (the “EBITDA Percentage”), after deducting a percentage equal to
the EBITDA Percentage multiplied by the Proportion Repaid; and

(b) in relation to a Reinvestment, the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group for what
was the Latest Ratio Period at the time of the Reinvestment (but taking into account each disposal
made by the Bank Group after the last day of that Latest Ratio Period and prior to the date of the
relevant Reinvestment) which is represented by the Annualised EBITDA of the person or asset
acquired multiplied by the Proportion Reinvested,

AA-134


-----

**Where:**

the “Proportion Reinvested” is that proportion of the purchase price for the person or asset acquired
which is represented by the amount of the Net Proceeds of a previous disposal that were reinvested
pursuant to the relevant Reinvestment;

the “Proportion Repaid” is that proportion of the Net Proceeds of that disposal prepaid pursuant to Clause
12.2(a) (Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) and/or repaid pursuant to Clause 11.1 (Voluntary
_Prepayment); and_

“Reinvestment” means the reinvestment of all or any part of the Net Proceeds of a previous disposal made
under paragraph (b)(ix) above by the Bank Group after the Signing Date, including in circumstances where
all or any part of such Net Proceeds are distributed as a Permitted Payment and an equity subscription is
subsequently made in, or a Subordinated Funding is subsequently made to, a member of the Bank Group.

(e) Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement or the relevant Security Document, the
Company will not sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its assets which are
subject to a Security Document to which it is a party.

(f) In the event that a transaction (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of a Permitted Disposal and also
meets the criteria of a Permitted Payment, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to
divide and classify such transaction (or a portion thereof) as a disposal permitted under Clause 24.11
(Disposals) and/or a Restricted Payment under Clause 24.14(c) (Restricted Payments).

subparagraphs (C) to (G) below are provided to the Facility Agent within 30 days after
the date on which the merger is entered into;

(B) if the proposed merger is between a member of the Bank Group and an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the Company has delivered to the Facility Agent within 30 days after the
date on which the merger is entered into, a certificate signed by an authorised signatory

to the shares in each relevant Original Entity within 60 days of the merger;

(E) such Merged Entity has entered into Security Documents (if applicable) within 60 days
of the merger which provide security over the same assets of at least an equivalent
nature and ranking to the security provided by the relevant Original Entities pursuant to
any Security Documents entered into by them;

(F) any possibility of the Security Documents referred to in subparagraphs (D) or (E)
above being challenged or set aside is not materially greater than any such possibility
in relation to the Security Documents entered into by, or in respect of the share capital
of, any relevant Original Entity; and

(G) all the property and other assets of the relevant Original Entities are vested in the
Merged Entity and the Merged Entity has assumed all the rights and obligations of the
relevant Original Entities under any, material Necessary Authorisations and Licences
and other licences or registrations (to the extent reasonably necessary for the business
of the relevant Original Entities) granted in favour of the Original Entities under
Telecommunications and Cable Laws and/or all such rights and obligations have been
transferred to the Merged Entity and/or the relevant Necessary Authorisations and
Licences and other licences or registrations (to the extent reasonably necessary for the
business of the relevant Original Entities) granted in favour of the Original Entities
under Telecommunications and Cable Laws have been reissued to the Merged Entity,

except that the requirements of paragraphs (C) to (G) above will not apply in respect of
any merger between Original Entities:

(1) both of which are not Obligors; and

(2) neither one of which is party to a Security Document, neither one of whose share
capital is charged pursuant to a Security Document and neither one of whom owes
any receivables to another member of the Bank Group which are pledged pursuant
to a Security Document; or

(v) in the event that the relevant member of the Bank Group liquidates or dissolves in
accordance with the provisions of Clause 24.31 (Internal Reorganisations).

identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to
it, the Company shall promptly upon the request of the Facility Agent or any Lender supply, or
procure the supply of, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the

within 60 days of its accession to this Agreement as an Obligor (or if longer by the end

of the delivery of a compliance certificate by the Company demonstrating that the 80%
Security Test is not satisfied; and

(ii) the Facility Agent (acting reasonably) is satisfied that the 80% Security Test would have

Permitted Affiliate Parent as a Borrower and/or a Guarantor and the inclusion of the
Subsidiaries of the Permitted Affiliate Parent as members of the Bank Group in the manner
set out in Clause 26.1 (Permitted Affiliate Group Designation)) for which the 80% Security
Test is being tested and any other transactions that took place after the end of such Financial
Quarter that also required the satisfaction of the 80% Security Test; and

(ii) any member of the Bank Group which (A) is not an Obligor and (B) has not granted
Security over assets in accordance with the 80% Security Test, each in favour of the
Security Trustee in accordance with this Clause, shall (subject to the provisio to the

**24.34 Intentionally Left Blank**

**24.35 Limited Condition Transaction**

(a) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no
Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such
action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Company, be deemed satisfied, so long
as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreement (or other
relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Company has exercised its option under the first sentence of this
paragraph (a) and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the date that such definitive
agreement for a Limited Condition Transaction is entered into prior to the consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have
occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection
with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted under this Agreement.

(b) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the
calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the ratio of Senior Net Debt to Annualised
EBITDA or Total Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA, or testing baskets set forth in this Agreement
including baskets measured as a percentage or multiple, as applicable, of Total Assets or Annualised
EBITDA, in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option
in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination
of whether such action is permitted under this Agreement shall be deemed to be the date of that
definitive agreement (or other relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition
Transaction is entered into (the “LCT Test Date”) provided that the Company shall be entitled to
subsequently elect, in its sole discretion, the date of consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction instead of the LCT Test Date as the applicable date of determination and if, after giving
pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof), as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, a Permitted Affiliate Parent or any member of the Bank Group could have
taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the relevant ratio, test or basket,
such ratio, test or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.

(c) If the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which
compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Annualised EBITDA or Total Assets,
of the Company, a Permitted Affiliate Parent and any member of the Bank Group or the person or
assets subject to the Limited Condition Transaction (as if each reference to the Company or a member
of the Bank Group in such definitions was to such person or assets) at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant transaction or action, such ratios, tests or basket amounts will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited
Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, test or basket
availability under this Agreement on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier
of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the definitive agreement
for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been
consummated.

**24.36 Group Redesignation**

The Company may at any time deliver a notice (a “Group Redesignation Notice”) to the Facility Agent
designating any Holding Company of the Company and/or any Holding Company of any Permitted
Affiliate Parent as a “New Group Topco” for the purposes of this Agreement, provided that, taking into
account any actions to be taken by the Company for the benefit of the Lenders, it would not be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Lenders in the opinion of the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).

(iv) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific
amount is set out in this Agreement and any definitions used therein (including all “annual”,
“life of Facilities” and “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by 50 per
cent.

(b) If at any time after a Release Condition has been satisfied and a Release Condition subsequently
ceases to be satisfied, any breach of this Agreement or any other Finance Document that arises as a
result of any of the obligations, restrictions or other terms referred to in paragraph (a) above ceasing
to be suspended or amended shall not (provided that it did not constitute an Event of Default at the
time the relevant event or occurrence took place) constitute (or result in) a breach of any term of this
Agreement or any other Finance Documents, a Default or an Event of Default.

(c) In respect of any amount which has not been applied in mandatory prepayment of the Facilities in
accordance with Clause 12 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation) as a result of the Release
Condition being satisfied (the “Released Amounts”), if the Release Condition subsequently ceases to
be satisfied after the date the prepayment would have been required had the Release Condition not
been satisfied, the failure to apply the Released Amounts in prepayment shall not result in a breach of
any term of this Agreement or any other Finance Document.

(d) For the purposes of this Clause 24.37 the “Release Condition” means the Facilities or the Company
receive any two of the following:

(i) a rating of “Baa3” (or the equivalent) or higher from Moody’s or any of its successors or
assigns;

(ii) a rating of “BBB-” (or the equivalent) or higher from Standard & Poor’s or any of its
successors or assigns; and/or

**28.** **DEFAULT INTEREST**

**28.1 Consequences of Non-Payment**

If any sum due and payable by the Parent or any Obligor under this Agreement is not paid on the due date
therefor in accordance with the provisions of Clause 33 (Payments) or if any sum due and payable by an
Obligor pursuant to a judgment of any court in connection with this Agreement is not paid on the date of
such judgment, the period beginning on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of such judgment
and ending on the Business Day on which the obligation of such Obligor to pay the Unpaid Sum is
discharged shall be divided into successive periods, each of which (other than the first) shall start on the
last day of the preceding such period (which shall be a Business Day) and the duration of each of which
shall (except as otherwise provided in this Clause 28 (Default Interest)) be selected by the Facility Agent.

**28.2 Default Rate**

During each such period relating thereto as is mentioned in Clause 28.1 (Consequences of Non-Payment)
an Unpaid Sum shall bear interest at the rate per annum which is one per cent. per annum higher than the
rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment,
constituted an Advance in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods or Terms,
each of a duration selected by the Facility Agent in accordance with Clause 28.1 (Consequences of
_Non-Payment), provided that if such Unpaid Sum is all or part of an Advance which became due and_
payable on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period or Term relating thereto, the first Interest
Period or Term applicable to it shall be of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of that Interest Period
or Term and the rate of interest applicable thereto from time to time during such Interest Period or Term
shall be that which exceeds by one per cent. the rate which would have been applicable to it had it not so
fallen due.

**28.3 Maturity of Default Interest**

Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 28.2 (Default Rate) in respect of an Unpaid Sum shall
be due and payable and shall be paid by the Obligor owing such sum at the end of the period by reference
to which it is calculated or on such other dates as the Facility Agent may specify by written notice to such
Obligor.

**28.4 Construction of Unpaid Sum**

Any Unpaid Sum shall (for the purposes of this Clause 28 (Default Interest), Clause 19 (Increased Costs)
and Clause 31 (Break Costs)) be treated as an advance and accordingly in those provisions the term
“Advance” includes any Unpaid Sum and the term “Interest Period” and “Term”, in relation to an Unpaid
Sum, includes each such period relating thereto as is mentioned in Clause 28.1 (Consequences of
_Non-Payment)._

**29.** **GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY**

Relevant Finance Parties the due and punctual payment by each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor of all
sums payable by each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor under each of the Relevant Finance Documents
and agrees that promptly on demand it will pay to the Facility Agent each and every sum of money which
each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor is at any time liable to pay to any Relevant Finance Party under
or pursuant to any Relevant Finance Document and which has become due and payable but has not been
paid at the time such demand is made and provided that before any such demand is made on a Restricted
Guarantor, demand for payment of the relevant sum shall first have been made on the relevant Borrower or
Hedging Obligor.

**29.2 Indemnity**

With effect from the Signing Date, or if later, the date upon which it accedes to this Agreement in such
capacity, each Guarantor (other than a Restricted Guarantor) irrevocably and unconditionally agrees,

Relevant Finance Party on demand by the Facility Agent from and against any loss incurred by such
Relevant Finance Party as a result of any of the obligations of each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor
under or pursuant to any Relevant Finance Document being or becoming void, voidable, unenforceable or
ineffective as against any Borrower or Hedging Obligor for any reason whatsoever (whether or not known
to that Relevant Finance Party or any other person) the amount of such loss being the amount which the
Relevant Finance Party suffering it would otherwise have been entitled to recover from the relevant
Borrower or Hedging Obligor and provided that the amount payable by a Guarantor under this Clause 29.2
(Indemnity) shall not exceed the amount such Guarantor would have had to pay under Clause 29.1
(Guarantee) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.

**29.3 Continuing and Independent Obligations**

The obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement shall constitute and be continuing obligations
which shall not be released or discharged by any intermediate payment or settlement of all or any of the
obligations of each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor under the Relevant Finance Documents, shall
continue in full force and effect until the unconditional and irrevocable payment and discharge in full of all
amounts owing by each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor under each of the Relevant Finance
Documents and are in addition to and independent of, and shall not prejudice or merge with, any other
security (or right of set off) which any Relevant Finance Party may at any time hold in respect of such
obligations or any of them.

**29.4 Avoidance of Payments**

Where any release, discharge or other arrangement in respect of any obligation of any Borrower or
Hedging Obligor, or any Security held by any Relevant Finance Party therefor, is given or made in reliance

insolvency, liquidation or otherwise and whether or not any Relevant Finance Party has conceded or
compromised any claim that any such payment or other disposition will or should be avoided or repaid (in
whole or in part), the provisions of this Clause 29 (Guarantee and Indemnity) shall continue as if such
release, discharge or other arrangement had not been given or made.

**29.5 Immediate Recourse**

None of the Relevant Finance Parties shall be obliged, before exercising or enforcing any of the rights
conferred upon them in respect of the Guarantors by this Agreement or by Law, to seek to recover amounts
due from any Borrower or Hedging Obligor or to exercise or enforce any other rights or Security any of
them may have or hold in respect of any of the obligations of any Borrower or Hedging Obligor under any
of the Relevant Finance Documents save that no demand for any payment may be made on any Restricted
Guarantor unless such demand has first been made on the relevant Borrower or Hedging Obligor.

**29.6 Waiver of Defences**

Neither the obligations of the Guarantors contained in this Agreement nor the rights, powers and remedies
conferred on the Relevant Finance Parties in respect of the Guarantors by this Agreement or by Law shall
be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by:

any other person or any change in the status, function, control or ownership of any Borrower or
Hedging Obligor or any such person;

Obligor or any other person in respect of its obligations or (ii) in respect of any security granted under

AA-168


-----

(e) any total or partial failure to take, or perfect, any Security proposed to be taken in respect of the
obligations of any Borrower or Hedging Obligor or any other person under the Relevant Finance
Documents;

(f) any total or partial failure to realise the value of, or any release, discharge, exchange or substitution
of, any security held by any Relevant Finance Party in respect of any Borrower or Hedging Obligor’s
obligations under any Relevant Finance Document;

(g) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the
members or status of an Obligor, any Hedging Obligor or any other person;

(h) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however fundamental and whether or
not more onerous) or replacement of a Relevant Finance Document or any other document or security
including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility
or the addition of any new facility under any Relevant Finance Document or other document or
security; or

(i) any other act, event or omission which might operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of
the obligations of any of the Guarantors under this Agreement or any of the rights, powers or
remedies conferred upon the Relevant Finance Parties or any of them by this Agreement or by Law.

**29.7 No Competition**

Until all amounts which may become payable by each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor under or in
connection with the Relevant Finance Documents have been paid in full, no Guarantor will exercise any
rights:

(a) to claim by way of contribution or indemnity in relation to any of the obligations of each Borrower
and each Hedging Obligor under any of the Relevant Finance Documents;

(b) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Borrower or Hedging Obligor or any other person or its estate in
competition with the Relevant Finance Parties or any of them;

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights

security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Relevant Finance Documents by any Relevant
Finance Party;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor or Hedging Obligor to make any
payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee,
undertaking or indemnity under Clause 29.1 (Guarantee); or

(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor or Hedging Obligor,

except to the extent that the Facility Agent so requires and in such manner and upon such terms as the
Facility Agent may specify and each Guarantor shall hold any moneys, rights or security held or received
by it as a result of the exercise of any such rights on trust for the Facility Agent for application in or
towards payment of any sums at any time owed by each Borrower and each Hedging Obligor under any of
the Relevant Finance Documents as if such moneys, rights or security were held or received by the Facility
Agent under this Agreement.

**29.8 Appropriation**

To the extent any Relevant Finance Party receives any sum from any Guarantor in respect of the
obligations of any of the other Obligors or Hedging Obligors under any of the Relevant Finance
Documents which is insufficient to discharge all sums which are then due and payable in respect of such
obligations of such other Obligors or Hedging Obligors, such Relevant Finance Party shall not be obliged
to apply any such sum in or towards payment of amounts owing by such other Obligor or Hedging
Obligors under any of the Relevant Finance Documents, and any such sum may, in the Relevant Finance
Party’s discretion, be credited to a suspense or impersonal account and held in such account pending the
application from time to time (as the Relevant Finance Party may think fit) of such sums in or towards the
discharge of such liabilities owed to it by such other Obligor or Hedging Obligors under the Relevant
Finance Documents as such Relevant Finance Party may select provided that such Relevant Finance Party
shall promptly make such application upon receiving sums sufficient to discharge all sums then due and
payable to it by such other Obligor or Hedging Obligors under the Relevant Finance Documents.

**29.9 Limitation of Liabilities of United States Guarantors**

Each Restricted Guarantor and each of the Relevant Finance Parties (by its acceptance of the benefits of
the guarantee under this Clause 29 (Guarantee and Indemnity)) hereby confirms its intention that this
guarantee should not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for the purposes of any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law, the United States Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal,
state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Restricted Guarantor and each of the
Relevant Finance Parties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the guarantee under this Clause 29
(Guarantee and Indemnity)) hereby irrevocably agrees that its obligations under this Clause 29 (Guarantee
_and Indemnity) shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum_
amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Restricted Guarantor that are relevant
under such laws, and after giving effect to any rights to contribution pursuant to any agreement providing
for an equitable contribution among such Restricted Guarantor and the other Guarantors, result in the
obligations of such Restricted Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance.

**29.10 US Guarantors**

(a) In this Clause, the terms “Fraudulent Transfer Laws,” “US Obligor” and “US Guarantor” are to be
construed in accordance with the Fraudulent Transfer Laws.

(b) Each US Guarantor acknowledges that:

(i) it will receive valuable direct or indirect benefits as a result of the transactions financed by
the Relevant Finance Documents;

(ii) those benefits will constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the
purpose of any fraudulent transfer law; and

(iii) each Relevant Finance Party has acted in good faith in connection with the guarantee given
by that US Guarantor and the transactions contemplated by the Relevant Finance
Documents.

(c) Each US Guarantor represents and warrants to each Relevant Finance Party that:

(i) the aggregate amount of its debts (including its obligations under the Relevant Finance
Documents) is less than the aggregate value (being the lesser of fair valuation and present
fair saleable value) of its assets;

(ii) its capital is not unreasonably small to carry on its business as it is being conducted;

(iii) it has not incurred and does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they
mature; and

(iv) it has not made a transfer or incurred any obligation under any Relevant Finance Document
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors.

(i) is made by each US Guarantor on the Signing Date;

(ii) is deemed to be repeated by:

(A) each Acceding Guarantor on the date that Acceding Guarantor becomes a US
Guarantor; and

(B) each US Guarantor on the date of each Utilisation Request and the first day of each
Term; and

(iii) is, when repeated, applied to the circumstances existing at the time of repetition.

Document, the obligations being guaranteed by any Guarantor (by express guarantee, grant of
security, or otherwise) shall not include any Excluded Swap Obligations.

**29.11 Keepwell**

irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by

AA-170


-----

each other Obligor to honor all of its obligations under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause
29 (Guarantee and Indemnity) in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified
ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Clause 29.11 (Keepwell) for the maximum amount of
such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Clause 29.11
(Keepwell), or otherwise under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause 29 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity), voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, or_
otherwise, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under
this Clause 29.11 (Keepwell) shall remain in full force and effect until the obligations under the
Relevant Finance Documents are discharged in full. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this
Clause 29.11 (Keepwell) constitutes, and this Clause 29.11 (Keepwell) shall be deemed to constitute, a
“keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Obligor for all purposes of
Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(b) As used in this Clause 29.11 (Keepwell), “Qualified ECP Guarantor” means, in respect of any Swap
Obligation, each Obligor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant guarantee
or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or
such other person as constitutes an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act
or any regulations promulgated thereunder and can cause another person to qualify as an “eligible
contract participant” at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the
Commodity Exchange Act.

**29.12 Droit de Discussion and Droit de Division**

(a) Any right which at any time any Guarantor may have under the existing or future laws of Jersey
whether by virtue of the droit de discussion or otherwise to require that recourse be had to the assets

assumed by such Guarantor under or in connection with any Relevant Finance Document is hereby
waived.

(b) Any right which at any time any Guarantor may have under the existing or future laws of Jersey
whether by virtue of the droit de division or otherwise to require that any liability under any guarantee
or indemnity given in or in connection with any Relevant Finance Document be divided or
apportioned with any other person or reduced in any manner whatsoever is hereby waived.

**29.13 Guarantee Limitations**

This guarantee does not apply to any liability to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting
unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of sections 678 or 679 of the Act or any equivalent and
applicable provisions under the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant Guarantor and, with
respect to any Acceding Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Notice applicable
to such Acceding Guarantor.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Relevant Finance Document to the contrary, none of the
Facility Agent, the Arranger or the L/C Bank is obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or
might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a breach of a fiduciary
duty or duty of confidentiality.

in accordance with any instructions given to it by the Instructing Group or Revolving Facility
Instructing Group, as applicable (or, if so instructed by the Instructing Group or Revolving Facility
Instructing Group, as applicable, refrain from acting or exercising any right, power, authority or
discretion vested in it as Facility Agent) and (ii) shall not be liable to any Relevant Finance Party for
any act (or omission) if it acts (or refrains from taking any action) in accordance with such an
instruction of the Instructing Group.

instructions should only be binding on the Lenders under that Facility) or (ii) a Revolving Facility
Instructing Group will be binding on all the Lenders under the relevant Revolving Facility.

(c) The Facility Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing
Group, a Revolving Facility Instructing Group, or, if appropriate, the Lenders until it has received
such security or collateral as it may require for any cost, loss or liability (together with any associated
VAT) which it may incur in complying with such instructions.

(d) In the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group, a Revolving Facility Instructing Group, or,
if appropriate, the Lenders, the Facility Agent may act (or refrain from taking action) as it considers to
be in the best interests of the Lenders.

applicable law or regulation relating to insider dealing or otherwise.

**30.9 Exclusion of Liability**

(a) Without limiting paragraph (b) below (and without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 33.8(e)

will not be liable to any Relevant Finance Party for any action taken by it under or in connection with
any Relevant Finance Document, unless directly caused by its negligence or wilful misconduct.

(b) No Party (other than any Agent, L/C Bank or Ancillary Facility Lender (as applicable)) may take any
proceedings, or assert or seek to assert any claim, against any officer, employee or agent of any
Agent, L/C Bank or Ancillary Facility Lender in respect of any claim it might have against such
Agent, L/C Bank or Ancillary Facility Lender or in respect of any act or omission of any kind by that
officer, employee or agent in relation to any Relevant Finance Document and agrees that any such
officer, employee or agent may enforce this provision.

(c) The Facility Agent will not be liable for any failure to notify any person of any matter referred to in
Clause 14.1(e) (Calculation of interest – Term Rate Advances) and Clause 14.2(e) (Calculation of
_interest – Compounded Rate Advances) or any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an_
account with an amount required under the Relevant Finance Documents to be paid by it if it has
taken all reasonable steps to comply with Clause 14.1(e) (Calculation of interest – Term Rate
_Advances) and Clause 14.2(e) (Calculation of interest – Compounded Rate Advances) and taken all_
necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating
procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by it for that purpose.

**30.10 Lender’s Indemnity**

Each Lender shall, in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are
then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero, indemnify
the Facility Agent from time to time within three Business Days of demand by any Agent against any cost,
loss or liability incurred by such Agent (otherwise than by reason of its negligence or wilful misconduct or,
in the case of any cost, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 33.8 (Disruption to Payment Systems)
notwithstanding the Facility Agent’s negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability
whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Facility Agent) in acting as a Facility

pursuant to the terms of the Relevant Finance Documents).

Kingdom as successor Facility Agent by giving notice to the Lenders and the Company.

(b) The Facility Agent may resign without having designated a successor as agent under paragraph

Lenders and the Company, in which case the Instructing Group may appoint a successor Facility
Agent (acting through an office in the United Kingdom), approved by the Company, acting
reasonably. If the Instructing Group has not appointed a successor Facility Agent in accordance with
this paragraph (b) within 30 days after notice of resignation was given, the Facility Agent may appoint
a successor Facility Agent (acting through an office in the United Kingdom), approved by the
Company, acting reasonably.

(c) Provided no Default is continuing, the Company may, by notice to the Facility Agent, require the
Facility Agent to resign by giving five Business Days’ notice. In this event, the Facility Agent shall
resign and the Company shall appoint a successor Facility Agent (without any Lender’s consent but
the successor Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders of its appointment). The Company may exercise
such right to replace the Facility Agent twice during the life of the Facilities.

Facility Agent.

obligation in respect of the Relevant Finance Documents (other than obligations under paragraph

shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such
successor Facility Agent had been an original Party as Facility Agent.

(g) If requested by the Company by written notice to the Facility Agent, the Facility Agent shall resign in
accordance with this Clause 30.11 (Resignation) if on or after the date which is three months before

Documents the Facility Agent notifies the Company that the Facility Agent will cease to be a FATCA
Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date and (in each case) the Company reasonably
believes that a Party would be required to make a deduction on account of FATCA that would not be
required if the Facility Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party.

through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate person from any other of its divisions
or departments.

confidential to that division or department and the Facility Agent shall not be deemed to have notice
of it.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Relevant Finance Document to the contrary, the Relevant
Finance Parties are not obliged to disclose to any other person (i) any confidential information or
(ii) any other information if the disclosure would, or might in its reasonable opinion, constitute a
breach of any Law.

**30.13 Facility Office**

The Facility Agent may treat each Lender as a Lender, entitled to payments under this Agreement and
acting through its Facility Office unless it has received not less than five Business Days prior notice from
that Lender to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Ancillary Facility Lender that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own
independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Relevant
Finance Document including but not limited to:

of its respective assets under or in connection with any Relevant Finance Document, the transactions
contemplated by the Relevant Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document
entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Relevant Finance
Document;

AA-175


-----

(d) the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information provided by the Facility Agent, the
Bookrunners, the Arrangers or by any other person under or in connection with any Relevant Finance
Document, the transactions contemplated by the Relevant Finance Documents or any other
agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in
connection with any Relevant Finance Document; and

priority of any of the Security or the existence of any Security Interests affecting the Security.

**30.15 Deduction from Amounts Payable by the Facility Agent**

If any amount is due and payable by any party to the Facility Agent under any Relevant Finance Document
the Facility Agent may, after giving notice to that party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from
any payment to that party which the Facility Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Relevant
Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the
purposes of the Relevant Finance Documents that party shall be regarded as having received such payment
without any such deduction.

**30.16 Obligors’ Agent**

(a) The Parent and each Obligor (other than the Company) irrevocably authorises the Company to act on
its behalf as its agent in relation to the Relevant Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises:

(i) the Company on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself, its financial condition
and otherwise to the relevant persons contemplated under this Agreement and to give all
notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests), to
execute on its behalf any Relevant Finance Document and to enter into any agreement in
connection with the Relevant Finance Documents notwithstanding that the same may affect
the Parent or such Obligor, without further reference to or the consent of the Parent or such
Obligor; and

(ii) each Relevant Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to be given
to or served on the Parent or such Obligor pursuant to the Relevant Finance Documents to
the Company on its behalf,

and in each such case the Parent or such Obligor will be bound thereby as though the Parent or such
Obligor itself had supplied such information, given such notice and instructions, executed such
Relevant Finance Document and agreement or received any such notice, demand or other
communication and each Relevant Finance Party may rely on any action purported to be taken by the
Company on behalf of that Obligor.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, notice or other communication given
or made by the Obligors’ Agent under any Relevant Finance Document, or in connection with this
Agreement (whether or not known to the Parent or any other Obligor, as the case may be, and whether
occurring before or after such person became party to this Agreement), shall be binding for all
purposes on the Parent and all other Obligors as if the Parent or the other Obligors had expressly
made, given or concurred with the same. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other
communications of the Obligors’ Agent and the Parent or any other Obligor, those of the Obligors’
Agent shall prevail.

(c) If (notwithstanding the fact that the guarantees granted under this Agreement are, and the Security is,
intended to guarantee and secure, respectively, all obligations arising under the Relevant Finance
Documents), any guarantee or Security does not automatically extend from time to time to any
(however fundamental and of whatsoever nature and whether or not more onerous) amendment,
variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Relevant Finance Documents and/or any
Facility or amount made available under any of the Relevant Finance Documents, each Obligor (other
than the Company) expressly confirms that the Company as Obligors’ Agent is authorised to confirm
such guarantee and/or Security on behalf of such Obligor.

**30.17 Co-operation with the Facility Agent**

(a) Each Lender and each Obligor will co-operate with the Facility Agent to complete any legal
requirements imposed on the Facility Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under

AA-176


-----

this Agreement and shall supply any information requested by the Facility Agent in connection with
the proper performance of those duties provided that neither the Parent nor any Obligor shall be under
any obligation to provide any information the supply of which would be contrary to any
confidentiality obligation binding on any member of the Group or prejudice the retention of legal
privilege in such information and provided further that neither the Parent nor any Obligor shall (and
the Company shall procure that no member of the Bank Group shall) be able to deny the Facility
Agent any such information by reason of it having entered into a confidentiality undertaking which
would prevent it from disclosing, or be able to claim any legal privilege in respect of, any financial
information relating to itself or the Group.

(b) Any Lender may by notice to the Facility Agent appoint a person to receive on its behalf all notices,
communications, information and documents to be made or dispatched to that Lender under the
Relevant Finance Documents. Such notice shall contain the address, fax number and (where
communication by electronic mail or other electronic means is permitted under Clause 40.5
(Electronic Communication)) electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable
the sending and receipt of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or officer, if
any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and be treated as a notification of a substitute
address, fax number, electronic mail address (or such other information), department and officer by
that Lender for the purposes of Clause 40.2 (Giving of Notice) and Clause 40.5(a)(iii) (Electronic
_Communication) and the Facility Agent shall be entitled to treat such person as the person entitled to_
receive all such notices, communications, information and documents as though that person were that
Lender.

**30.18 Accession documents**

The Facility Agent will promptly countersign each Deed of Accession (as defined in the Group

to this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement and HYD Intercreditor Agreement.

agrees to give notice of resignation under clause 5.1 (Resignation of Security Trustee) of the Security
Trust Agreement and to use its reasonable commercial efforts (at the cost of the Company) to resign
in accordance with the provisions of the Relevant Trustee Documents.

(c) If the Security Trustee gives notice of its resignation under clause 5.1 (Resignation of Security
_Trustee) of the Security Trust Agreement, each Lender hereby gives its consent, under clause 5.3_
(Successor Security Trustee) of the Security Trust Agreement, to the appointment of The Bank of
Nova Scotia (or one of its Affiliates) as a successor Security Trustee in accordance with the
provisions of the Relevant Trustee Documents.

paid by that Borrower on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period or Term for that Term
Rate Advance or Unpaid Sum.

(e) the Facility Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses whatsoever (including, without
limitation for negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not

currency of either obligation. If the obligations are in different currencies, the Relevant Finance Party
may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the
purpose of the set-off.

(b) Any credit balances taken into account by an Ancillary Facility Lender when operating a net limit in

or recovery to the Facility Agent;

(b) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the

receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(c) the Recovering Relevant Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Facility
Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the “Sharing Payment”) equal to such receipt or
recovery less any amount which the Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering
Relevant Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 33.5
(Partial Payments).

**35.2 Redistribution of Payments**

The Facility Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the Parent or the relevant
Obligor and shall distribute it between the Relevant Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Relevant
Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 33.5 (Partial Payments).

**35.3 Recovering Relevant Finance Party’s Rights**

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under Clause 35.2 (Redistribution of Payments), of a payment
received by a Recovering Relevant Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant Obligor and the

treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Relevant Finance Party becomes
repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Relevant Finance Party, then:

(a) each Relevant Finance Party which has received a share of the relevant Sharing Payment pursuant to
Clause 35.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall, upon the request of the Facility Agent, pay to the
Facility Agent for account of that Recovering Relevant Finance Party an amount equal to its share of
the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Relevant
Finance Party for its share of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Relevant
Finance Party is required to pay); and

(b) that Recovering Relevant Finance Party’s rights of subrogation in respect of any reimbursement shall
be cancelled and the Parent or the relevant Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing Relevant Finance
Party for the amount so reimbursed.

Recovering Relevant Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause 35

(b) A Recovering Relevant Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Relevant Finance Party
under this Clause 35 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties), any amount which the

Notwithstanding any other term of any Relevant Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement
or understanding between the Parties, each Party acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any Party
to any other Party under or in connection with the Relevant Finance Documents may be subject to Bail-In
Action by the relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of:

**35.8 QFC Credit Support**

(a) To the extent that the Relevant Finance Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise,
for any Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC
**Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the Parties acknowledge and agree as**
follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution
**Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below**
applicable notwithstanding that the Relevant Finance Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact
be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other
state of the United States):

becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of
such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and
obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in
property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered
Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any
such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of

a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
Default Rights under the Relevant Finance Documents that might otherwise apply to such
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered
Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be
exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Relevant
Finance Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United
States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the Parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights

amount guaranteed by it as a Guarantor will not be decreased, subject to Clause 43.7 (Release of

(e) If a relevant disposal or other transaction is not made, the Resignation Letter of that Borrower or

(Insolvency Proceedings), 27.8 (United States Bankruptcy Laws), 27.9 (Execution or

the Company (acting in its sole discretion), provided that no such consent shall be required in the case
of any assignment, transfer or Sub-participation:

(i) by a Lender to another Lender under a Revolving Facility and/or to its Affiliate (or, if

participations in Advances denominated in Sterling, Dollars or euro respectively) (or
its equivalent as at the date of such assignment or transfer) unless its Commitment and
Outstandings under any Facility is less than such amount, in which case it shall be
permitted to transfer or assign its entire Commitment and Outstandings for such
Facility;

(B) which would result in it or the proposed assignee or transferee holding an aggregate
participation of more than zero but less than £1,000,000 (or its equivalent as at the date
of such assignment or transfer) in the Facilities, save that an assignment or transfer
may be made to or by a trust, fund or other non-bank entity which customarily
participates in the institutional market which would result in such entity holding an
aggregate participation of at least £1,000,000, $1,000,000 or €1,000,000 (in the case of
participations in Advances denominated in Sterling, Dollars or euro respectively) in the
Facilities; or

subject at all times to Clause 37.5, relinquish some or all of its voting rights in respect of the

be aggregated.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the consent of each L/C Bank shall be
required (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) for any assignment or transfer of
any Lender’s rights and/or obligations under a Revolving Facility provided that in relation to any
assignment or transfer required by the Company under Clause 10.4 (Right of Repayment and
_Cancellation in Relation to a Single Lender) or Clause 43.15 (Replacement of Lenders), an L/C Bank_
may not withhold such consent unless, acting reasonably, the reason for so doing relates to the
creditworthiness of the proposed New Lender.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 37.4 (Assignments or Transfers by Lenders), no
assignment or transfer shall be permitted to settle or otherwise become effective within the period of
five Business Days prior to (i) the end of any Interest Period (or Term) or (ii) any Repayment Date.

avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or
waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with
this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in
accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the
transferring Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

transfer or sub-participate any of its rights, benefits or obligations under the Finance Documents to a

and remains liable under the Relevant Finance Documents for any such obligation;

(b) such Lender retains exclusive control over all rights and obligations in relation to the participations
and Commitments that are the subject of the relevant agreement or arrangement, including all voting
rights (for the avoidance of doubt, free of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which it is
required to or will consult with any other person in relation to the exercise of any such rights and/or
obligations), unless:

(i) the proposed sub-participant is a person to whom the relevant rights and obligations could
have been assigned or transferred in accordance with the terms of this Clause 37; and

(ii) prior to entering into the relevant agreement or arrangement, the relevant Lender provides
the Company with full details of that proposed sub-participant and any voting, consultation

of the Relevant Finance Documents or in any monies received by the relevant Lender under or in
relation to this Agreement or any of the Relevant Finance Documents (in its capacity as

under or in relation to this Agreement or any of the Relevant Finance Documents (in its capacity as
sub-participant under that arrangement).

**37.6 Sub-participant Register**

(a) In the case of a Sub-participation (in each case, other than any non-voting derivatives (which are not
participations) which would otherwise be caught by the definition of “Sub-participation”), the person
granting the Sub-participation (or similar right) shall, acting solely for these purposes as non-fiduciary
agent for the Borrower, maintain a register (a “Sub-Participant Register”) on which it enters the
name and address of each sub-participant (or person holding the similar right) and the Commitment
and obligations (including principal and stated interest) in which each sub-participant (or other
person) has an interest or obligation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, including without limitation Clause 36
(Calculations and Accounts), the entries in the Sub- Participant Register shall be conclusive (absent
manifest error), and such person maintaining the Sub-Participant Register shall treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Sub-Participant Register as the owner of such Sub-participation (or
similar right) for all purposes under the Relevant Finance Documents notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary.

(c) Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Clause 37, no Lender shall have any obligation to
disclose all or any portion of the Sub-Participant Register to any person (including the identity of any
sub-participant or any information relating to a sub-participant’s interest in any Advance,
Commitments or other obligations under any Relevant Finance Documents) except to the extent that
such disclosure to a tax authority is necessary to establish that such Advance, Commitment or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or
is otherwise required thereunder.

**37.7 Assignments**

(a) Unless such assignment or transfer is effected by a Transfer Agreement pursuant to Clause 37.9

Relevant Finance Documents, unless and until the relevant assignee has agreed with the other
Relevant Finance Parties that it shall be under the same obligations towards each of them as it would
have been under if it had been an original party to the Relevant Finance Documents as a Lender, such
assignment shall not become effective and the other Relevant Finance Parties shall not be obliged to
recognise such assignee as having the rights against each of them which it would have had if it had
been such a party to this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting any right or discretion of the Facility Agent under the Relevant Finance Documents,
the Facility Agent may in its discretion stop processing assignments or transfers under this Clause 37
(Assignments and Transfers) when a notice of prepayment has been received by it under this
Agreement, for a period of five Business Days prior to the date the prepayment is required or
expected to be made.

**37.8 Transfer Deed**

Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Facility Agent on such Transfer
Deed or Transfer Agreement falling on or after) the date of execution of such Transfer Deed or
Transfer Agreement by the Facility Agent:

(i) to the extent that in such Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement the Lender party to it seeks
to transfer its rights, benefits and obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents, the
Parent, each of the Obligors and such Lender shall be released from further obligations
towards one another under the Relevant Finance Documents to that extent and their
respective rights against one another shall be cancelled to that extent (such rights and
obligations being referred to in this Clause 37.8 (Transfer Deed) as “discharged rights and
**obligations”);**

(ii) the Parent, each of the Obligors and the New Lender party to it shall assume obligations
towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
discharged rights and obligations only insofar as the Parent, such Obligor and such New
Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of the Parent, such Obligor and
such Lender;

(iii) the other Relevant Finance Parties and the New Lender shall acquire the same rights and
benefits and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired
and assumed had such New Lender been an original party to the Relevant Finance
Documents as a Lender with the rights, benefits and obligations acquired or assumed by it
as a result of such transfer and to that extent the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security
Trustee, each L/C Bank and any relevant Ancillary Facility Lender and the Lender which
has transferred its rights, benefits and obligations shall each be released from further
obligations to each other under the Relevant Finance Documents; and

Agent a Transfer Agreement via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Facility Agent or
(ii) if previously agreed with the Facility Agent, manually execute and deliver to the Facility Agent a
Transfer Agreement, and the assignee shall provide to the Facility Agent such information as may be
required by the Facility Agent for the purposes of this Agreement (including any applicable tax forms)
in which the assignee shall designate one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level
information (which may contain material non-public information about the Obligors and their
Affiliates or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information
in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including U.S. federal
and state securities laws.

(b) By executing and delivering a Transfer Agreement, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee
thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto the
representations set out in paragraph 1 of Annex 1 to the Transfer Agreement.

assignee, the transfer fee referred to in Clause 37.11 (Transfer Fee) and, if required, the written
consent of the Company to such assignment and any applicable tax forms, the Facility Agent shall
(i) accept such Transfer Agreement and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.

**37.10 Limitation of Responsibility of Transferor**

(a) Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, a Lender which assigns or transfers its rights and/or

Documents, the Security or any other documents;

(ii) the financial condition of any Obligor;

(iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other member of the Group of its

(iv) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any
Relevant Finance Document or any other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

(b) Each New Lender confirms to the Transferor and the other Relevant Finance Parties that it:

(i) has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of
the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with
its participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information
provided to it by the Transferor or any other Relevant Finance Party in connection with any
Relevant Finance Document or the Security; and

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor
and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Relevant
Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Relevant Finance Document obliges a Transferor to:

(i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations
assigned or transferred under this Clause 37 (Assignments and Transfers); or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the
non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents
or otherwise.

in an Advance or Commitment hereunder shall be effective unless and until recorded in the Register.

rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Relevant
Finance Documents.

**37.19 Pro rata Interest Settlement**

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a “pro rata

so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

(i) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for
the account of the Transferor; and

(ii) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for
the application of this Clause 37.19 (Pro rata Interest Settlement), have been payable to it
on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

The Facility Agent shall, within 10 Business Days of receiving a notice relating to an assignment pursuant

correct and appropriately authorised.

**38.7 Value Added Tax**

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under any Relevant Finance Document by any Obligor to a
Relevant Finance Party shall be exclusive of any VAT. If VAT is chargeable on any supply made by a
Relevant Finance Party to any Obligor under any Relevant Finance Document (whether that supply is
taxable pursuant to the exercise of an option or otherwise), the Relevant Finance Party shall provide a

entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

to any other Relevant Finance Party (the “Recipient”) under a Relevant Finance Document, and any
party other than the Recipient (the “Subject Party”) is required by the terms of any Relevant Finance
Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than
being required to reimburse the Recipient in respect of that consideration), such party shall also pay to
the Supplier (in addition to and at the same time as paying such amount) an amount equal to the
amount of such VAT. The Recipient will promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any
credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient
reasonably determines is in respect of such VAT.

is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the
context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the
term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Relevant Finance Parties or any of
them, any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or

other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

specifications for, the Designated Website following designation of that website by the Company and
the Facility Agent.

relevant Security Document or certify that any floating charge constituted by any
relevant Security Documents over such shares, assets, revenues or rights has not
crystallised; and

AA-199


-----

(B) release any person which as a result of that disposal, ceases to be the Parent or any
Obligor, from any guarantee, indemnity or Security Document to which it is a party
and its other obligations under any other Relevant Finance Document.

(b) The Security Trustee shall only be required under paragraph (a) above to grant the release of any
Security or to deliver a certificate of non-crystallisation on account of a disposal as described in that
paragraph if:

(i) the disposal or resignation is (A) permitted under Clause 24.11 (Disposals), (B) in
accordance with Clause 37.2(b)(i)(B) (Resignation of an Obligor (Other than the
_Company)), (C) as a result of, or in connection with, any solvent liquidation or dissolution_
that complies with Clause 24.31 (Internal Reorganisation) or (D) in circumstances where
the consent of the Instructing Group has been obtained; and

(ii) to the extent that the disposal is to be in exchange for replacement assets the Security
Trustee has either received (or is satisfied, acting reasonably, that it will receive within 60
days of the date of the disposal) one or more duly executed Security Documents granting
Security over those replacement assets or is satisfied, acting reasonably, that the
replacement assets will be subject to Security pursuant to any existing Security Documents.

(c) If at any time the Obligors at the relevant time represent a percentage which is greater than that
required to satisfy the 80% Security Test and the Company provides a certificate to the Facility Agent
certifying that upon the release of one or more specified Obligors from its obligations under this
Agreement the 80% Security Test would continue to be satisfied, the Security Trustee shall (and it is
hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the request and cost of the Company,
execute such documents as may be required to release such specified Obligors from any guarantees,
indemnities and/or Security Documents to which it is a party and to release it from its other
obligations under any Relevant Finance Document, provided however that suspension of the
provisions of paragraph (b) of Clause 24.26 (Further Assurance) pursuant to Clause 24.37 (Ratings
_Trigger) shall not by itself permit a release pursuant to this paragraph (c). Any Obligor, whose assets_
are to be released by this paragraph (c) or any other provision of this Agreement or the Relevant
Finance Documents and who as a result will not have granted security over its assets in accordance
with the 80% Security Test for the benefit of the Relevant Finance Parties, shall, for purposes of the
determination of the 80% Security Test, not be treated as an Obligor for the calculation in the
preceding sentence and on a going forward basis. The release provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not
permit any release of any guarantees or Security in favour of the Relevant Finance Parties, in each
case, granted by the Parent, the Company and any Borrower (other than the Company) for as long as
such entity is a Borrower.

(d) The Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the
cost of the relevant Obligor, execute such documents as may be required or desirable to effect any
release (i) permitted under clause 10.2 (Releases) and clause 10.3 (Release of Obligors), in each case,
of the Security Trust Agreement, (ii) to which a prior written consent of the relevant Lenders has been
granted in accordance with Clause 43.6 (Guarantees and Security), (iii) required to permit the
granting of any Security Interest permitted under Clause 24.8 (Negative pledge), (iv) expressly
permitted under the Relevant Finance Documents (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to
any consent obtained from the Instructing Group), (v) in connection with any Permitted Transaction
(other than a Permitted Transaction pursuant to paragraph (a) or (i) of that definition) or (vi) if it is
necessary or desirable in connection with Clause 24.31 (Internal Reorganisation).

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may require the Security
Trustee to, and the Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance
Parties to) at the cost of the relevant Obligor, execute such documents as may be required or desirable
to effect the release of the Security granted over any asset of an Obligor pursuant to the Security
Documents to which it is a party to enable the relevant Obligor to grant in connection with that asset
any encumbrance permitted under Clause 24.8 (Negative pledge). If, immediately prior to such release
the relevant Obligor was treated as an Obligor for the purpose of the 80% Security Test, the relevant
Obligor shall continue to be treated as an Obligor for those purposes notwithstanding any such
release.

(f) The Company may designate that (i) any Affiliate Subsidiary is no longer an Affiliate Subsidiary and
(ii) any Subsidiary of an Affiliate Subsidiary that is an Obligor is no longer an Obligor, and require
the Security Trustee to, and the Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other
Relevant Finance Parties to) at the cost of the Company, execute such documents as may be required

AA-200


-----

or desirable to effect the release of the guarantees provided and Security granted in connection with
the accession of such Affiliate Subsidiary and/or Subsidiary of such Affiliate Subsidiary as a
Guarantor (“Affiliate Subsidiary Release”); provided that immediately after giving effect to such
Affiliate Subsidiary Release, either (A) the Guarantors at the relevant time represent a percentage
which is greater than that required to satisfy the 80% Security Test such that it would continue to be
satisfied or (B) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur
as a consequence thereof and either (1) an Obligor could incur at least £1 of additional Financial
Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (b)(xxiv) of Clause 24.13 (Restrictions _on_ _Financial_
_Indebtedness) or (2) the ratios of Senior Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA and of Total Net Debt to_
Annualised EBITDA would be no greater than they were immediately prior to giving effect to such
designation, in each case, on a pro forma basis taking into account such Affiliate Subsidiary Release.

(g) The Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the
cost of the Company, execute such documents as may be required or desirable to effect the release of
any guarantees and/or Security which it is necessary or desirable to release in connection with any
Permitted Tax Reorganisation provided that any equivalent guarantees and/or Security in respect of
any other Pari Passu Lien Obligations are released simultaneously.

(h) The Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) upon
the occurrence of a Permitted Guarantee Release, at the cost of the Company, execute such documents
as may be required or desirable to effect the release of any guarantees and Security (other than
Security in respect of (i) the shares in the Company and (ii) intercompany receivables payable by the
Company) granted by the Parent.

**43.8 Asset Security Release**

(a) Following receipt by the Lenders of the Lender Asset Security Release Confirmation, the Security
Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties (including, if
applicable, in their capacities as Hedge Counterparties (under and as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)) to) be irrevocably authorised by the
Lenders to execute such documents as may be required to ensure that the Security (other than any
Security required to be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is
released.

(b) The Lenders shall procure that any of their Affiliates that are Hedge Counterparties (under and as
defined in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement) shall, at the
request of the Company at any time, enter into all documentation that is necessary or desirable to
ensure that, subject to obtaining the consent to the extent necessary of any applicable party to the
Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement that is not a Party (or an
Affiliate of a Party that is a Hedge Counterparty (under and as defined in the Group Intercreditor
Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)) the Security (other than any Security required to
be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is released.

**43.9 Amendments Affecting the Facility Agent**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Facility Agent shall not be obliged to agree to
any amendment, consent or waiver if the same would:

(a) amend or waive any provision of Clause 30 (Role of the Facility Agent, the Arrangers, the L/C Banks
_and Others), Clause 37.12 (Disclosure of Information), Clause 38 (Costs and Expenses) or this Clause_
43 (Amendments); or

(b) otherwise amend or waive any of the Facility Agent’s rights under this Agreement or subject the
Facility Agent to any additional obligations under this Agreement.

**43.10 Calculation of Consent**

Where a request for a waiver of, or an amendment to, any provision of any Relevant Finance Document
has been sent by the Facility Agent to the Lenders at the request of an Obligor:

(a) each Lender that does not respond to such request for waiver or amendment within 10 Business Days
after receipt by it of such request (or within such other period as the Facility Agent and the Company
shall specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in determining whether the requisite level of
consent to such waiver or amendment was granted; and

AA-201


-----

(b) the Facility Agent, in determining whether sufficient Lenders have consented to that amendment or
waiver, shall not take into account any Commitments or Advances under any relevant Facility in
relation to which a cancellation or prepayment notice (as applicable) has been served in accordance
with Clause 10.1 (Voluntary Cancellation) or Clause 11.1 (Voluntary Prepayment) provided that to
the extent that any cancellation or prepayment is not made on the date specified in a relevant
cancellation or prepayment notice then the requirement to take into account any such Commitments or
Advances under any relevant Facility shall be reinstated with retroactive effect from the date of
delivery of such cancellation or prepayment notice.

**43.11 Reference Banks and Alternative Reference Banks**

An amendment and waiver which relates to the rights and obligations of a Reference Bank or an
Alternative Reference Bank (each in their capacity as such) may not be effected without the consent of that
Reference Bank or that Alternative Reference Bank, as the case may be.

**43.12 Primary Term Rate**

If any Primary Term Rate is not available for a currency which can be selected for a Utilisation, any
amendment or waiver which relates to providing for another benchmark rate to apply in relation to that
currency in place of that Primary Term Rate (or which relates to aligning any provision of a Relevant
Finance Document to the use of that other benchmark rate) may be made with the consent of the Facility
Agent (acting in its sole discretion and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any requirement to consult with
or seek any consent or instruction from the Lenders or any other Finance Party) and the Company.

**43.13 Published Rate**

Any amendment or waiver which relates to providing for the use of any alternative benchmark rate (each a
“Replacement Benchmark”) as the replacement for any Screen Rate from time to time for the purpose of
any Utilisation in any currency under any Facility under this Agreement including, without limitation:

(a) aligning any provision of any Finance Document to the use of that Replacement Benchmark;

(b) enabling that Replacement Benchmark to be used for the calculation of interest under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any consequential changes required to enable that Replacement
Benchmark to be used for the purposes of this Agreement);

(c) implementing market conventions applicable to that Replacement Benchmark;

(d) providing for appropriate fall-back (and market disruption) provisions for that Replacement
Benchmark;

(e) adjusting the pricing to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable, any transfer of
economic value from one Party to another as a result of the application of that Replacement
Benchmark;

(f) any other amendment or waiver which may be reasonably required, appropriate, necessary or
desirable in connection with and/or to facilitate the implementation and use of such Replacement
Benchmark; or

(g) any further modification to the terms relating to that Replacement Benchmark after its implementation
under this Agreement,

may be made with the consent of the Facility Agent (acting in its sole discretion and, for the
avoidance of doubt, without any requirement to consult with or seek any consent or instruction from
the Lenders or any other Finance Party) and the Company (in each case, acting reasonably) from time
to time, provided that in selecting any alternative benchmark rate the Facility Agent and the Company
shall consider the benchmark rates being used at that time in the then prevailing market for syndicated
debt financings of a similar size to, and in the same currency as, the relevant Utilisation or Facility
and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Facility Agent and the Company may agree to provide for the use
of different benchmark rates for different Utilisations and/or Facilities under this Agreement
notwithstanding that they may be denominated in the same currency.

**43.14 Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders**

(a) In ascertaining the Instructing Group, affected Lenders, all Lenders or any other class of Lenders (as
applicable) or whether any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of any
of the Commitments has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or
other vote under the Relevant Finance Documents, a Defaulting Lender’s Commitments and
participations will be deemed to be zero.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 43.14 (Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders), the Facility Agent
may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:

(i) any Lender which has notified the Facility Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender;
and

(ii) any Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or circumstances referred
to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of “Defaulting Lender” has occurred,

unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting
evidence reasonably requested by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent is otherwise aware that the
Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

**43.15 Replacement of Lenders**

(a) If at any time:

(i) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender; or

(ii) any Lender becomes a Non-Funding Lender,

then the Company may, on not less than three Business Days prior notice to the Facility Agent and
that Lender (A) replace that Lender by requiring it to (and that Lender shall) transfer all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to a Lender or other person selected by the Company for a
purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender’s share in the outstanding
Utilisations and all accrued interest and fees and other amounts payable to it under this Agreement or
(B) prepay that Lender all but not part of its share in its outstanding Utilisations and all accrued
interest and fees and other amounts payable to it under this Agreement from any source of funds
available to the Bank Group. Any notice delivered under this paragraph (a) shall be accompanied by a
Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement complying with Clause 37 (Assignments and Transfers), which
Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement shall be immediately executed by the relevant Non-Consenting
Lender or, as the case may be, Non-Funding Lender and returned to the Company. If a Lender does
not execute and/or return a Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement as required by this paragraph
(a) within two Business Days of delivery by the Company, the Facility Agent shall execute (and is
hereby irrevocably authorised by the relevant Lender to do so) that Transfer Deed or Transfer
Agreement on behalf of such Lender.

(b) The Company shall have no right to replace the Arrangers, the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee
under paragraph (a) above and none of the foregoing nor shall any Lender have any obligation to the
Company to find a replacement Lender or other such person.

(c) In no event shall the Lender being replaced be required to pay or surrender to such replacement
Lender or other person any of the fees received by such Lender being replaced pursuant to this
Agreement.

**43.16 Ancillary Facilities**

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility Document shall require the consent of any
Relevant Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Facility Lender.

**44.** **THIRD PARTY RIGHTS**

(a) A person which is not a Party (a “third party”) shall have no right to enforce any of its provisions
except that:

(i) a third party shall have those rights it would have had if the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 had not come into effect; and

(ii) each of Clause 18.3 (Tax Indemnity), Clause 19 (Increased Costs) and Clause 30.9
(Exclusion of Liability) shall be enforceable by any third party referred to in such clause as
if such third party were a Party.

AA-203


-----

(b) Subject to Clause 43.11 (Reference Banks and Alternative Reference Banks) but otherwise
notwithstanding any term of any Finance Documents the consent of any third party is not required to
rescind or vary this Agreement at any time.

**45.** **COUNTERPARTS**

A Relevant Finance Document (other than a Security Document governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
which requires such Security Document to be signed on a single copy in order for such Security Document
to grant a valid and enforceable Security Interest) may be executed in any number of counterparts and all
of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

**46.** **GOVERNING LAW**

This Agreement, including all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, English Law.

**47.** **JURISDICTION**

**47.1 Courts**

Each of the Parties (other than the US Borrower) irrevocably agrees for the benefit of each of the Relevant
Finance Parties that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit,
action or proceedings, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with this
Agreement or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
(respectively “Proceedings” and “Disputes”) and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts.

**47.2 Waiver**

Each of the Obligors (other than the US Borrower) irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or
hereafter have to Proceedings being brought or Disputes settled in the courts of England and agrees not to
claim that any such court is an inconvenient or inappropriate forum.

**47.3 Service of Process**

Each of the Obligors (other than the US Borrower) which is not incorporated in England agrees that the
process by which any Proceedings are begun may be served on it by being delivered in connection with
any Proceedings in England, to the Company at its registered office for the time being and the Company,
by its signature to this Agreement, accepts its appointment as such in respect of each such Obligor. If the
appointment of the person mentioned in this Clause 47.3 (Service of Process) ceases to be effective in
respect of any of the Obligors the relevant Obligor shall immediately appoint a further person in England
to accept service of process on its behalf in England and, failing such appointment within 15 days, the
Facility Agent shall be entitled to appoint such person by notice to the relevant Obligor. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

**47.4 Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions**

Nothing in Clause 47.1 (Courts) shall (and shall not be construed so as to) limit the right of the Relevant
Finance Parties or any of them to take Proceedings against any of the Obligors (other than the US
Borrower) in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in any one or
more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or
not) if and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

**47.5 US Borrower**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 47 (Jurisdiction), each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States sitting
in the State of New York, and of the courts of the US Borrower’s corporate domicile with respect to
actions or proceedings brought against the US Borrower as a defendant, for purposes of all legal
proceedings relating to the US Borrower (a “US Proceeding”) and relating to, or arising out of, this

AA-204


-----

Agreement. The US Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any US Proceeding and any claim that any
US Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Any process or summons for purposes of any
US Proceeding may be served on a US Borrower by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail, or a form of
mail substantially equivalent thereto, addressed to it at its address as provided for notices hereunder.

**47.6 General Consent**

Each of the Obligors consents generally in respect of any Proceedings or US Proceedings to the giving of
any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such proceedings including the making,
enforcement or execution against any property whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any
order or judgment which may be made or given in such proceedings.

**47.7 Waiver of Immunity**

To the extent that any Obligor may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its assets or revenues immunity
from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal
process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed to itself, its assets or revenues
such immunity (whether or not claimed), such Obligor irrevocably agrees not to claim, and irrevocably
waives, such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.

**47.8 Waiver of trial by jury**

EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY RELEVANT FINANCE DOCUMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY ANY RELEVANT FINANCE DOCUMENT. THIS
AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO TRIAL BY THE COURT.

**48.** **COMPLETE AGREEMENT**

The Relevant Finance Documents contain the complete agreement between the Parties on the matters to
which they relate and supersede all prior commitments, agreements and understandings, whether written or
oral, on those matters.

This Agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of this Agreement.

We refer to the Facilities Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement, the HYD Intercreditor Agreement and

We refer to Clause 2.3 (Increase) of the Facilities Agreement.

The Increase Lender agrees to assume and will assume all of the obligations corresponding to the Commitment

**SCHEDULE 19**
**AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES**

1. **Security Principles**

(a) The guarantees and security to be provided will be given in accordance with the security principles set
out in this Schedule (the “Security Principles”). This Schedule addresses the manner in which the
Security Principles will impact on the guarantees and security proposed to be taken in relation to this
transaction.

(b) The Security Principles embody recognition by all Parties that there may be certain legal and practical
difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from all Obligors and third party security providers
(together the “Security Providers”) in every jurisdiction in which the Security Providers are
incorporated. In particular:

(i) general statutory limitations (including, but not limited to, with respect to the relevant
jurisdictions for which guarantee limitation language is set out in Clause 29.13 (Guarantee
_Limitations) of this Agreement, such limitations as set out therein), regulatory requirements or_
restrictions, tax restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and “capital maintenance”
rules, retention of title claims, employee or works council consultation or approval requirements
and similar principles may limit the ability of a Security Provider to provide a guarantee or
security or may require that the enforcement of the guarantee or security be limited by or to an
amount or otherwise; if any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be
limited to the maximum amount which the relevant Security Provider may provide having regard
to applicable law (including any jurisprudence); additional guarantee limitations may be included
in any Accession Notice where required in connection with the accession of a new Obligor;

(ii) guarantees and security will not be required from or over the shares in, or over the assets of, any
joint venture or similar arrangement or any person which is neither an Obligor nor a Holding
Company of an Obligor;

(iii) third party security providers will not be required to provide any guarantees;

(iv) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the Bank
Group of providing such security (including any increase to the tax and/or regulatory costs of the
Bank Group) so as to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, those costs are
proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Finance Parties and the maximum guaranteed or
secured amount may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other
applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount
is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable
fees, taxes and duties, taking into account the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration
or other applicable fees, taxes and duties, provided that no maximum secured amount may be
limited to minimise any taxes imposed pursuant to section 956 of the Code;

(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will, subject to (iv) above, be granted over the material assets only;

(vi) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by this Agreement and which
prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security document;

(vii) if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or person acquired
by the Bank Group (where those third party arrangements were not entered into in contemplation
of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third party is required for that acquired
person to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset, such guarantee and/or security will
not be required to be granted;

(viii) Security Providers will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that
would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or
result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant
Security Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle;

(ix) the granting of guarantees, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will
be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within the time periods
specified in the Finance Documents thereof or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are

AA-258


-----

specified in the Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order
to ensure due perfection or as otherwise set out in this Schedule;

(x) the granting of guarantees, security or perfection of security will not be required if (1) it would
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Security Provider to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Finance
Documents or (2) it would be either impossible or impractical or would unduly disrupt the
business of the relevant Security Provider and, in each such event, a guarantee will not be granted
and/or security will not be taken over such assets, as applicable (including, without limitation,
notification of such security to any third party);

(xi) the Security Trustee on behalf of each of the Lenders shall be able, subject to the terms of the
Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement, to enforce the security
constituted by the security documents without any restriction from either:

(A) the constitutional documents of the relevant Security Provider;

(B) any Security Provider which is or whose assets are the subject of such security document
(but subject to any inalienable statutory rights which the Security Provider may have to
challenge such enforcement); or

(C) any shareholders of the foregoing not party to the relevant security document;

(xii) guarantee limitations may mean that access to the assets of a Security Provider for its guarantee is
limited, in which case, any asset security granted by that Security Provider shall be proportionate
(in terms of liability) to the value of its guarantee;

(xiii) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Obligors or material assets are not
located;

(xiv) local law restrictions may mean that the Lenders may not be able to benefit from the same
security;

(xv) the Security Trustee will hold one set of security for the Lenders (subject to applicable law);

(xvi) under the Dutch Works Council Act any Dutch members of the Bank Group may not, without the
advice of their works council, inter alia resolve to enter into any transaction effectuating:

(A) the attraction of an important credit on behalf of the relevant Dutch members of the Bank
Group;

(B) the provision of an important credit by such Dutch members of the Bank Group;

(C) the granting of guarantees and security by the relevant Dutch members of the Bank Group
for important debts of another entrepreneur; and

(D) the establishment of a right of pledge over the shares of the relevant Dutch members of the
Bank Group and the conditional transfer of the voting rights to the pledgee; and

(xvii) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any Excluded Swap Obligations.

(c) The Security Trustee (upon request or instruction, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement) or
the other Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall promptly discharge any guarantees and release any
security which is or are subject to any transaction permitted by this Agreement, unless contrary to these
Security Principles.

2. **Guarantors and Security**

(a) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 29 (Guarantees and Indemnity) of this Agreement and the
Security Principles, each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and
will be for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject
to, the requirements of the Security Principles set out in paragraph 1 above in each relevant jurisdiction
and the requirements of local law in each relevant jurisdiction.

(b) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 29 (Guarantees and Indemnity) of this Agreement and this
Schedule, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Trustee and not the Finance Parties
individually. “Parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be
contained in the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement and not the

AA-259


-----

individual security documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be
no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender transfers any of
its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender.

(c) Security Documents will, to the extent legally possible and subject to this Schedule, incorporate the
defined terms used in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and/or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement and
secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and/or the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement) of the relevant Obligor to the secured parties, in each case in accordance with,
and subject to, local law requirements and the requirements of this Schedule in each relevant
jurisdiction and, in no circumstances, shall impose any obligation more onerous than those contained in
this Agreement other than to the extent required by local law in order to create, enforce or perfect the
security interest expressed to be created thereby.

(d) Where a Security Provider secures shares, the relevant security document will be governed by the laws
of the company whose shares are being charged or pledged and not by the law of the country of the
Security Provider.

(e) No action will be required to be taken in relation to any guarantee or security where any Lender
transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Facilities. The Security Providers will not be liable for
any fees, costs, taxes or expenses in relation to any re-registration, re-notarisation or other requirement
for perfection or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by Finance Parties.

(f) Any security document shall only be required to be notarised or notarially certified if required by law
in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence.

3. **Terms of Security Documents**

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken as part of this transaction
subject to due execution of all relevant security documents, completion of all relevant formalities, the
reservations or qualifications in the Finance Documents or the Legal Reservations and the application of the
Security Principles:

who is not a Security Provider and (y) security shall not be granted over any assets other than as set out
in (i) and (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, security in respect of any real property);

(b) the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any security permitted under the
Finance Documents;

(c) security will not be enforceable until the date on which, following the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing, either the Relevant Agent (as defined in the Group Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Trustee notifies the relevant chargor of the occurrence of that Event of
Default, or takes, under any one or more of the Senior Finance Documents (as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Agreement), any of the steps it is entitled to take by reason of the occurrence of such
Event of Default and will be enforceable only subject to the terms of the Group Intercreditor
Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement (a “Declared Default”);

(d) any rights of set-off will not be exercisable until the occurrence of a Declared Default;

(e) notification of receivables security to debtors (other than intra-group debtors where notice will be given
as soon as is reasonably practicable) will only be given if a Declared Default has occurred (subject to
local law advice);

document to the extent they relate to the security interest or secured assets or any registration or
perfection of the security unless otherwise required by local law;

AA-260


-----

(g) the provisions of each security document will not be unduly burdensome on the Security Provider (in
relation to the benefit conferred) or interfere materially with the operation of its business and will be
limited to those required to create effective security and will not impose commercial obligations and
shall not contain additional representations and undertakings (such as in respect of insurance,
maintenance of assets, information or the payment of costs) or otherwise repeat any such
representations or undertakings given in this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the
HYD Intercreditor Agreement, other than those which are strictly required as a matter of law for the
creation and perfection of the security;

(h) in the security documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in this Agreement
(or the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement) including, without
limitation, those relating to notices, costs and expenses, default or penalty interest, indemnities, tax
gross up or indemnity, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and
undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent that they are strictly
required by local law for the creation and perfection of the security interest expressed to be created
thereby; the security documents will not contain repeating representations;

(i) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, that they are strictly
required by local law to be provided to perfect, enforce or register the security and, when required,
shall be provided no more frequently than annually or, following a Declared Default on the Security
Trustee’s written request;

(j) the security documents should not and will not operate so as to prevent transactions which are not
prohibited under the other Finance Documents;

(k) the secured parties shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of a
Declared Default or if the relevant Security Provider has failed to comply with a further assurance or
perfection obligation within 10 Business Days of being notified of that failure and being requested to
comply (provided that in such case, the power of attorney shall be limited to remedying such failure);

(l) the Security Trustee shall (and is irrevocably authorised and instructed to) promptly enter into and
deliver any documentation and/or take such other action as may be required by the Company to give
effect to the Security Principles;

(m) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same
type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental charges to be delivered in respect
of future assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental
charges shall be provided at intervals no more frequently than annually, in each case on the Security
Trustee’s reasonable written request; and

(n) each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the
security document and this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor
Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of this Agreement or (as
applicable) the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement will take priority
over the provisions of the relevant security document.

4. **Share Security**

(a) Subject to these Security Principles, the shares in each Obligor shall be secured.

(b) The security document will be governed by the laws of the Obligor whose shares are being secured and
not by the law of the country of the Security Provider granting the security.

(c) Until a Declared Default, the Security Providers will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights
to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of the security or cause an event of default to occur and the person whose shares have
been pledged will be permitted to pay dividends to each of its shareholders (including the Security
Provider) and the relevant Security Provider shall be entitled to receive dividends from such person.

(d) Where customary the share certificate and a stock transfer form executed in blank will be provided to
the Security Trustee, and where required by law the share certificate or shareholders register will be
endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided
to the Security Trustee, in each case, within 20 Business Days following execution of any security over
those shares or the registration of the acquisition of those shares that are subject to such security.

AA-261


-----

(e) Unless the restriction is required by law (or as expressly contemplated in any security document), the
constitutional documents of any company the shares in which are subject to security will be amended
to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement
of the security granted over them.

(f) The enforcement of security over shares and the acquisition or exercise by the Security Trustee of
voting rights in respect of shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, enforcement of
any security over shares and the exercise by the Security Trustee of the voting rights in respect of such
shares will be expressed to be conditional upon obtaining any consents required by law or regulation
and no such consents shall be required to be sought or requested prior to a Declared Default and written
request having been made by the Security Trustee to the Company.

5. **Receivables**

(a) If a Security Provider grants security over its intercompany receivables or rights in respect of
Subordinated Funding it shall be free to deal with same in the course of its business (provided
permitted by this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)
until notified by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default.

(b) The perfection of receivables security granted by notification will not be required until the occurrence
of a Declared Default other than where such notification is required by applicable law to create
security. If such notification is required by applicable law to perfect, notice of the security will be
served on the relevant counterparties in respect of material intercompany receivables and Subordinated
Funding within 20 Business Days of the security being granted and the Security Provider shall use its
commercially reasonable endeavours (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of external
expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the
Security Provider has used its commercially reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain
acknowledgement or acceptance its obligation to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance shall cease on
the expiry of that 20 Business Day period.

(c) Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would
prevent the Security Provider from dealing with a receivable in the course of its business (provided
permitted by this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)
no notice of security shall be served until required by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default.

6. **Real Estate**

(a) There will be no obligation for a Security Provider to grant security over real property provided that a
Security Provider may grant a floating charge (or other similar security) over any of its material
freehold real property under a security document which charges all of the assets of the relevant
Security Provider.

(b) There will be no obligation to investigate title, provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due
diligence.

7. **Bank Accounts**

(a) There will be no obligation for a Security Provider to grant security over its bank accounts provided
that a Security Provider may grant a floating charge (or other similar security) over any of its material
bank accounts under a security document which charges all of the assets of the relevant Security
Provider. Any security over bank accounts shall be subject to any prior Security Interests and any other
rights (including but not limited to set off rights) in favour of the bank which maintains the relevant
account which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the relevant bank.

(b) No notices of any Security Interest over bank accounts will be required to be served on the bank which
maintains the relevant account.

8. **Fixed Assets**

Security Provider may grant a floating charge (or other similar security) over any of its material fixed assets
under a security document which charges all of the assets of the relevant Security Provider.

AA-262


-----

9. **Insurance Policies**

(a) There will be no obligation for a Security Provider to grant security over its insurance policies provided
that a Security Provider may grant a floating charge (or other similar security) over any of its material
insurance policies which permit the granting of security over such insurance policies (excluding any
third party liability or public liability insurance and any directors and officers insurance) under a
security document which charges all of the assets of the relevant Security Provider.

(b) No notices of any Security Interest over insurance policies will be required to be served on the relevant
insurer, no loss payee or other endorsement will be required to be made on the relevant insurance
policy, no physically issued (if any) insurance policies will be required to be delivered to the Security
Trustee (or any other Finance Party) and the Security Trustee will not (and neither will any other
Finance Party) be required to be named as co-insured on the relevant insurance policies.

10. Intellectual Property

(a) There will be no obligation for a Security Provider to grant security over its intellectual property
provided that a Security Provider may grant a floating charge (or other similar security) over any of its
material intellectual property which permit the granting of security over such intellectual property, in
terms of (if applicable) the relevant licensing agreement, under a security document which charges all
of the assets of the relevant Security Provider.

(b) No notices of any Security Interest over intellectual property will be required to be served on the
relevant counterparty to the licensing agreement, no security over any intellectual property will be
required to be registered at any national or supra-national intellectual property registry and any security
over intellectual property will be taken on an “as is, where is” basis and the Security Trustee will not
(and no other Finance Party will) require any changes to be made to, or corrections of filings on,
external intellectual property registers.

11. Release of Security

Unless required by local law, the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt
with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be
the same as those set out in this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor
Agreement.

Credit Facility Amendments, unless (i) such consideration is also offered to be paid to the Issuer (as a Credit
Facility Lender) in respect of the Finco Loan € on a pro rata basis and (ii) if the Issuer consents, waives or

supplement any Credit Facility Loan Document requiring the consent of the Instructing Group or all Credit
Facility Lenders to amend, waive or supplement, unless such amendment, waiver or supplement applies to
all Credit Facility Lenders; provided that this Clause 2.5 will not apply to (a) the Credit Facility
Amendments, (b) any such amendment, waiver or supplement that does not adversely affect the rights of the
Issuer or the holders of the Notes in any material respect, (c) any amendment, waiver or supplement
consented to by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes in

the aggregate of the Claim Amount and all of the obligations of the Issuer ranking pari passu with the

realisation of all of the assets of the Issuer other than any assets subject to a mortgage, charge,
assignment or pledge in favour of the Security Trustee, the proceeds of the issued ordinary share capital
of the Issuer and any transaction fees charged by the Issuer in respect of the issuance of the Notes (and

Issuer’s debts, costs, expenses and other obligations of the Issuer determined by its directors in their
absolute discretion other than the Claim and any obligations ranking pari passu with or behind the
Claim. If there are no Net Proceeds, any outstanding debt shall be extinguished and the Issuer shall
have no obligations to the Company, Holdco 5 or the Credit Facility Borrower (as the case may be)
under this Deed.

(c) Each of the Company, Holdco 5 and the Credit Facility Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the
Issuer’s obligations under this Deed are solely its corporate obligations, and that each of the Company,

directors, officers or employees for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, indemnities or other

(ii) do not seek to regulate a particular matter, step or action (which shall be the case if the
relevant matter, step or action is not the subject of an express requirement or restriction in that
Debt Document),

that Debt Document.

(u) In determining whether any indebtedness or other amount (including, without limitation, any Second
Lien Finance Documents) is prohibited by the terms of any Debt Document or to the extent any

amount is incurred by a member of the Group or following the taking effect of such
amendment or waiver,

shall not be taken into account (including for purposes of any vote or consent of any class (including
an Instructing Group) for the purposes of any Debt Document in respect of any such amendment or
waiver).

subject to the consent of specified Parties under this Agreement), the Parties hereto agree that such
step or action will be permitted under the other Debt Documents (or permitted thereunder subject to
the consent of such specified Parties) and if there is any conflict between the terms of, or the
requirement for any conditions in, this Agreement and any other Debt Document, the terms of, or the
requirement for any conditions in, this Agreement will prevail (save to the extent that to do so would
result in or have the effect of any member of the Group contravening any applicable law or
regulation, or present a material risk of liability for any member of the Group and/or its directors or
officers, or give rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties), in each case
notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the contrary, any provision expressed or purported
to override any provision of this Agreement or the requirement to fulfil any additional conditions, in
each case, in any other Debt Document.

(x) References to any Creditors (or any class, group or percentage of any Creditors (including, for the

to this Agreement implemented from time to time, and such paragraph and clause numbers are
referred to in any other Debt Document in force at the time of such amendments, such paragraph or
clause numbers shall be read and construed in this Agreement, for the purposes of the relevant Debt
Document only, so that the relevant equivalent provision in this Agreement is referred to in each
such Debt Document.

currency of the Documentary Credit to an interest-bearing account in the name of that Party and the
following conditions being met:

the account may only be made to pay the relevant Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to it
under the Debt Documents in respect of that Documentary Credit; and

security document over that account, in form and substance satisfactory to such Issuing Bank

taken or not taken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement while that Insolvency Event is
continuing).

(dd) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, where any provision of this Agreement grants any rights
(“Rights”) to, or refers to or otherwise contemplates any consent, approval, release, waiver,

any person:

(i) which is not a Party at such time;

relation thereto) at such time; or

(iv) in respect of Liabilities or Creditors (or other persons) for which the relevant Discharge Date
has occurred at or prior to such time or concurrently with any Action coming into effect,

unless otherwise agreed or specified by the Company, no Rights shall accrue or be enforceable and
such Action shall not be required (or be required from any person that is a party thereto) and no such
provision shall, or shall be construed so as to, in any way prohibit or restrict the rights or actions of
any member of the Group. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, no references to any agreement which
is not in existence (or under which no debt obligations are outstanding) shall, or shall be construed
so as to, in any way prohibit or restrict the rights or actions of any member of the Group (and no
Rights shall be granted to, or Action shall be required from, any party thereto).

(ee) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the express terms of this Agreement and any other applicable
Debt Document, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any debt exchange, non-cash rollover or
other similar or equivalent transaction in relation to any Liabilities.

(ff) To the extent that in this Agreement the consent of any Agent under any Debt Document or the
relevant Creditors under any Debt Document is required, then such consent is hereby expressly given

(a) Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, a person who is not a Party has no right
under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the “Third Parties Rights Act”) to enforce
or to enjoy the benefit of any term of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, the Consent of any person who is not a Party is not

Noteholder, Second Lien Noteholder, High Yield Noteholder or Unsecured Noteholder which by

to receive the benefits hereof, and be subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as if such person
was a Party hereto. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, upon any person becoming a Senior
Secured Noteholder, Second Lien Noteholder, High Yield Noteholder or Unsecured Noteholder,
such person shall be deemed a Party provided that such person is deemed to be a Party under the
terms of the relevant Notes Indenture.

or any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any Liabilities owed to it by
a Debtor or Security Grantor with the prior consent of the Company; and by written notice from the
Company to each Agent party to this Agreement and the Security Agent at such time (a “Unilateral
**Waiver”).**

(b) Following a Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the Security
Agent shall (i) be deemed to have unilaterally waived, relinquished, or otherwise released or
declined the right to receive or benefit from the same or any substantially equivalent right to the
rights subject to such Unilateral Waiver, in connection with any parallel debt and/or joint and several
creditorship structure relating to the relevant Liabilities; and (ii) at the request and cost of the
Company, take any action or execute any document reasonably requested by the Company which is
necessary or desirable to give effect to or evidence the releases and other actions described in this
Clause 1.4.

(c) Any Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall also be deemed to
constitute a waiver of the rights of such Party (and the Security Agent, as relevant) under Clause 18
(Application of Proceeds), Clause 19 (Equalisation) and any other equalisation or loss sharing
provisions under any Debt Document in so far as such provisions relate to the rights subject to such
Unilateral Waiver, including such that to the extent that the Liabilities of a Creditor would, but for
the Unilateral Waiver, have had the benefit of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss or Transaction Security under which Group Recoveries are received by the Security Agent or
other Creditors, that Creditor will not benefit from the application of, or receive any payments in
respect of, such Group Recoveries pursuant to Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) in respect of
those Liabilities; and if, as a result of this paragraph (c), the amount of a payment to a Creditor
pursuant to Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) is lower than the amount which would have been so

payable to that Creditor if no Unilateral Waiver was given (the difference for that Creditor being its
“Shortfall”), for the purposes of Clause 19 (Equalisation) its Exposure will be deemed to be reduced
by an amount equal to the Shortfall.

(d) To the extent that the consent of any Creditor or other Party (in each case other than the Company

and without any preference between them.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that any Hedging Liability that
constitutes an Excluded Swap Obligation shall not be secured by the assets of any Non-ECP Debtor.

**2.3** **Intra-Group Liabilities and Subordinated Liabilities**

(a) Each of the Parties agrees that the Intra-Group Liabilities and Subordinated Liabilities are postponed
and subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors or the Security Grantors to the Primary

Liabilities as between themselves.

**2.4** **Additional and/or Refinancing Debt**

(a) The Creditors acknowledge that the Debtors (or any of them) may wish to (a) incur incremental
Borrowing Liabilities and/or Guarantee Liabilities in respect of incremental Borrowing Liabilities or

existing Security pari passu with any existing Liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing
Liabilities and/or to share in any existing Security behind any existing Liabilities. The Creditors
confirm that if and to the extent such a financing or refinancing and such ranking and such Security
is permitted by the terms of the Debt Documents at such time, they will (at the cost of the Debtors)
co-operate with the Debtors with a view to enabling such financing or refinancing and such sharing
in the Security to take place. In particular, but without limitation, the Senior Lenders, the Senior
Secured Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Lenders, the Second Lien
Noteholders, the High Yield Lenders, the High Yield Noteholders, the Unsecured Lenders and the
Unsecured Noteholders hereby authorise and direct their Agent to and such Agent shall, and the
Hedge Counterparties agree that they shall, execute any amendment to this Agreement and such
other Debt Documents that are reasonably required to reflect such arrangements to the extent such
financing, refinancing and/or sharing is permitted by such Debt Documents.

(b) The Debtors may not incur any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities which:

(i) fall within paragraph (c) of the definition of Secured Obligations; but

(ii) do not fall within paragraphs (a) or (b) of the definition of Secured Obligations,

unless additional Security is granted in favour of the Secured Parties over the assets secured by each
Pre-Effective Date Security Document.

(i) are secured or expressed to be secured by Transaction Security on a basis junior to the Senior
Secured Liabilities but senior to the Second Lien Liabilities;

(ii) are expressed to rank or rank so that they are subordinated to any of the Senior Secured
Liabilities but are senior to the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(iii) are contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Liabilities and senior
in right of payment to the Second Lien Liabilities.

(b) The foregoing shall not prevent:

(i) subordination arising by operation of law; or

(ii) a Debtor from incurring additional Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Finance Documents which are expressed to be secured by the Transaction Security on a
_pari passu super senior basis to the other Senior Liabilities and/or which are contractually_
senior in right of payment to any of the other Senior Liabilities.

Agreement as a result of:

(A) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is based on the 1992 ISDA Master
Agreement:

(1) an Illegality or Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger (each as defined in the 1992
ISDA Master Agreement); or

(2) an event similar in meaning and effect to a Force Majeure Event (as defined in
paragraph (B) below),

has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement;

(B) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is based on the 2002 ISDA Master
Agreement, an Illegality or Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger or a Force Majeure
Event (each as defined in the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement) has occurred in respect of
that Hedging Agreement;

(C) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement,
any event similar in meaning and effect to an event described in paragraphs (A) or (B)
above has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement; or

AC-56


-----

(D) a Termination Event (other than a Termination Event described in paragraphs (A), (B)
and (C) above) in respect of which the Hedge Counterparty is an Affected Party
(“Termination Event” and “Affected Party” being as defined in the relevant Hedging
Agreement, in the case of a Hedging Agreement based on an ISDA Master Agreement)
or an equivalent termination event (in the case of a Hedging Agreement not based on an
ISDA Master Agreement),

in each case provided that no Distress Event has occurred and is continuing; or

(ix) if the Payment arises from a close-out or termination in whole or in part required pursuant to
Clause 4.16 (Terminations of Offsetting Swaps).

(b) No Payment may be made to a Hedge Counterparty under paragraph (a) above if:

(i) any Scheduled Payment due from that Hedge Counterparty to a Debtor under a Hedging
Agreement to which they are both party is due and unpaid; or

(ii) an Acceleration Event or an Insolvency Event has occurred, except from Group Recoveries
distributed in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

For the avoidance of doubt, no Payment will be due and unpaid by a Hedge Counterparty if a Hedge
Counterparty is entitled to withhold any payment pursuant to section 2(a)(iii) of the ISDA Master
Agreement or any provision similar in meaning and effect to section 2(a)(iii) of the ISDA Master
Agreement (in the case of a Hedging Agreement not based on an ISDA Master Agreement).

(c) Failure by a Debtor to make a Payment to a Hedge Counterparty which results solely from the
operation of paragraph (b) above shall, without prejudice to Clause 4.4 (Payment obligations
_continue), not result in a default (however described) in respect of that Debtor under that Hedging_
Agreement or any other Secured Debt Document.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement obliges a Hedge Counterparty to make a payment to a Debtor under a
Hedging Agreement to which they are both party if any Scheduled Payment due from that Debtor to
the Hedge Counterparty under that Hedging Agreement is due and unpaid. For the avoidance of
doubt, this provision shall not affect any Payment which is due from a Hedge Counterparty to a
Debtor as a result of a Hedging Agreement to which they are both a party being terminated or
closed-out.

**4.4** **Payment obligations continue**

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any Payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Debt Document by the operation of Clauses 4.2 (Restriction on
_Payment: Hedging Liabilities) and 4.3 (Permitted Payments: Hedging Liabilities) even if its obligation to_
make that Payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those Clauses.

**4.5** **No acquisition of Hedging Liabilities**

Without prejudice to Clause 4.6 (Amendments and Waivers: Hedging Agreements), following a Distress
Event the Debtors shall not, and the Company shall procure that no other member of the Group will:

(a) enter into any Liabilities Acquisition; or

(b) beneficially own all or any part of the share capital of a company that is party to a Liabilities
Acquisition,

in respect of any of the Hedging Liabilities unless the prior Consent of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors is obtained.

**4.6** **Amendments and Waivers: Hedging Agreements**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below and Clause 4.14 (No Outstanding Transactions), the Hedge
Counterparties and the Debtors may not, at any time, amend or waive any term of the Hedging
Agreements.

(b) A Hedge Counterparty and a Debtor may, by mutual agreement, amend or waive any term of a
Hedging Agreement to which they are a party in accordance with the terms of that Hedging
Agreement if:

(i) that amendment or waiver does not breach another term of this Agreement; and

AC-57


-----

(ii) such amendment or waiver would not result in a breach of the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture(s) or the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

**4.7** **Security: Hedge Counterparties**

The Hedge Counterparties may not take, accept or receive the benefit of any Security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss from any Debtor, any member of the Group or any Security
Grantor in respect of the Hedging Liabilities other than:

(a) the Common Transaction Security and (to the extent applicable) the Transaction Security granted
under the Pre-Effective Date Security Documents;

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss contained in:

(i) the form of the Senior Facilities Agreement as at the Effective Date;

(ii) this Agreement;

(iii) any Common Assurance; or

(iv) the relevant Hedging Agreement no greater in extent than any of those referred to in
paragraphs (i) to (iii) above;

(c) as otherwise contemplated by Clause 3.3 (Security and guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors); and

(d) the indemnities contained in the ISDA Master Agreements (in the case of a Hedging Agreement
which is based on an ISDA Master Agreement) or any indemnities which are similar in meaning and
effect to those indemnities (in the case of a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA
Master Agreement).

**4.8** **Restriction on Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties**

Subject to Clause 4.9 (Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties) and Clause 4.10 (Required
_Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties) and without prejudice to each Hedge Counterparty’s rights under_
Clauses 16.2 (Enforcement instructions) and 16.3 (Manner of enforcement), the Hedge Counterparties shall
not take any Enforcement Action in respect of any of the Hedging Liabilities or any of the hedging
transactions under any of the Hedging Agreements at any time.

**4.9** **Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties**

(a) To the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, a Hedge Counterparty may
terminate or close-out in whole or in part any hedging transaction under that Hedging Agreement
prior to its stated maturity:

(i) if, prior to a Distress Event, the Company has certified to that Hedge Counterparty that the
termination or close-out would not result in a breach of any of the following: (A) the Senior
Facilities Agreement; (B) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior
Secured Notes remain outstanding; or (C) the Pari Passu Debt Documents pursuant to which
any Pari Passu Debt remains outstanding;

ISDA Master Agreement); or

(2) an event similar in meaning and effect to a Force Majeure Event (as defined in
paragraph (B) below),

has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement;

(B) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is based on the 2002 ISDA Master
Agreement, an Illegality or Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger or a Force Majeure

that Hedging Agreement; or

AC-58


-----

(C) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement,
any event similar in meaning and effect to an event described in paragraphs (A) or (B)

of the Senior Facilities Agreement or any equivalent provision in any other Secured Debt
Document (other than a Hedging Agreement) which is similar in meaning and effect, in
relation to a Debtor that is a party to that Hedging Agreement;

(v) if the obligations owing by any Debtor under the relevant Hedging Agreement cease to be
secured by substantially the same Security as that which secures any other Senior Secured
Liabilities on a pari passu basis (or, if there are no other Senior Secured Liabilities outstanding
at the time, by the Security which secured such other Senior Secured Liabilities immediately
prior to their discharge); or

(vi) on or immediately following the later to occur of the Senior Lender Discharge Date, the Pari
Passu Debt Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date and the Second Lien
Discharge Date; provided that there is no refinancing of any debt discharged on any such
discharge date and provided that there are no classes of debt (in each case, other than Hedging
Liabilities, Subordinated Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities) for the purposes of this
Agreement following the occurrence of all such discharge dates.

(b) If a Debtor has defaulted on any Payment due under a Hedging Agreement (after allowing any
applicable notice or grace periods) and the default has continued unwaived for more than five
Business Days after notice of that default has been given by the relevant Hedge Counterparty to the
relevant Debtor and to the Security Agent pursuant to paragraph (m) of Clause 26.3 (Notification of
_prescribed events), the relevant Hedge Counterparty:_

(i) may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, terminate or
close-out in whole or in part all hedging transactions under that Hedging Agreement; and

(ii) until such time as the Security Agent has given notice to that Hedge Counterparty that the
Transaction Security is being enforced (or that any formal steps are being taken to enforce the
Transaction Security), shall be entitled to exercise any right it might otherwise have to sue for,
commence or join legal or arbitration proceedings against any Debtor to recover any Hedging
Liabilities due under that Hedging Agreement.

(c) After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Hedge Counterparty shall be entitled to exercise
any right it may otherwise have in respect of that Debtor or member of the Group to:

(i) prematurely close-out or terminate any Hedging Liabilities of that Debtor or member of the
Group;

(ii) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
Debtor or member of the Group in respect of any Hedging Liabilities;

(iii) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any Payment in respect of any Hedging
Liabilities of that Debtor or member of the Group; or

(iv) claim and prove in the liquidation of that Debtor or member of the Group for the Hedging
Liabilities owing to it.

**4.10 Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, a Hedge Counterparty shall promptly (if it is entitled to) terminate or
close-out in full all hedging transactions under all of the Hedging Agreements to which it is party
prior to their stated maturity, following:

(i) the occurrence of a Senior Acceleration Event, a Pari Passu Debt Acceleration Event or a
Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event and delivery to it of a notice from the Security
Agent that that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt Acceleration Event or Senior
Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable) has occurred; and

(ii) delivery to it of a subsequent notice from the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an
Instructing Group) instructing it to do so.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to the extent that that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt
Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable) occurred as a result

AC-59


-----

of an arrangement made between any Debtor and any Senior Secured Creditor with the purpose of
bringing about that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt Acceleration Event or Senior
Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable).

(c) If a Hedge Counterparty is entitled to terminate or close-out any hedging transaction under
paragraph (b) of Clause 4.9 (Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties) (or would have been
able to if that Hedge Counterparty had given the notice referred to in that paragraph) but has not
terminated or closed out each such hedging transaction, that Hedge Counterparty shall promptly
terminate or close-out in full each such hedging transaction following a request to do so by the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group).

**4.11 Treatment of Payments due to Debtors on termination of hedging transactions**

(a) If, on termination of any hedging transaction under any Hedging Agreement occurring after a
Distress Event, a settlement amount or other amount (following the application of any Close-Out
Netting, Payment Netting or Inter-Hedging Agreement Netting in respect of that Hedging
Agreement) falls due from a Hedge Counterparty to the relevant Debtor then that amount shall be
paid by that Hedge Counterparty to the Security Agent, treated as the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) The payment of that amount by the Hedge Counterparty to the Security Agent in accordance with
paragraph (a) above shall discharge the Hedge Counterparty’s obligation to pay that amount to that
Debtor.

**4.12 Terms of Hedging Agreements**

In the case of each Hedging Agreement entered into after the Effective Date, the Hedge Counterparties (to
the extent party to the Hedging Agreement in question) and the Debtors party to the Hedging Agreements
shall ensure that, at all times:

(a) each Hedging Agreement documents only Offsetting Swaps and/or other hedging transactions
permitted by the terms of the Senior Finance Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Senior
Secured Notes Finance Documents and the Second Lien Finance Documents, provided that this
paragraph (a) applies only to Debtors;

(b) each Hedging Agreement is based on or incorporates by reference either (i) an ISDA Master
Agreement or (ii) another framework agreement which is similar in effect to an ISDA Master
Agreement;

(c) in the event of a termination of the hedging transaction entered into under a Hedging Agreement,
whether as a result of:

(i) a Termination Event or an Event of Default, each as defined in the relevant Hedging
Agreement (in the case of a Hedging Agreement which is based on an ISDA Master
Agreement); or

(ii) an event similar in meaning and effect to either of those described in paragraph (i) above (in
the case of a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement),

that Hedging Agreement will:

(A) if it is based on a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, provide for payments under the
“Second Method” and will make no material amendment to section 6(e) (Payments on
_Early Termination) of the ISDA Master Agreement;_

(B) if it is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, make no material amendment to the
provisions of section 6(e) (Payments on Early Termination) of the ISDA Master
Agreement; or

(C) if it is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement, provide for any other method the effect
of which is that the party to which that event is referable will be entitled to receive
payment under the relevant termination provisions if the net replacement value of all
terminated transactions entered into under that Hedging Agreement is in its favour;

(d) each Hedging Agreement will provide that the relevant Hedge Counterparty will be entitled to
designate an Early Termination Date (as defined in the relevant ISDA Master Agreement) or
otherwise be able to terminate each transaction under such Hedging Agreement if so required
pursuant to Clause 4.10 (Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties);

AC-60


-----

(e) each Hedging Agreement will permit (but shall not require) the relevant Debtor to exercise its rights
provided for in (and in accordance with) Clause 4.13 (Termination of Hedging); and

(f) each Hedging Agreement states that it is a Hedging Agreement for the purposes of this Agreement.

**4.13 Termination of Hedging**

Each Debtor shall have the right (but not the obligation) to:

(a) terminate and cancel any Hedging Agreement upon 5 Business Days prior written notice to the
relevant Hedge Counterparty (with a copy to the Security Agent), provided that there are no
outstanding hedging transactions thereunder;

(b) terminate (in full or in part) any transaction under a Hedging Agreement with the prior written
consent of the relevant Hedge Counterparty, provided that no Senior Default, Senior Secured Notes
Default or Pari Passu Debt Default has occurred and is continuing at such time; and/or

(c) notwithstanding (b) above, terminate in full (or in part) any transaction under a Hedging Agreement
if at any time the financial indebtedness underlying such transaction has been reduced and the
Debtor party to that Hedging Agreement gives notice to the relevant Hedge Counterparty specifying
that there has been a reduction of financial indebtedness and the Debtor has elected to terminate the
transactions entered into to hedge risks in relation to such financial indebtedness (each such
transaction, a “Relevant Transaction”). Only a portion of each outstanding Relevant Transaction
shall be treated as an Affected Transaction under and as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement,
such portion being a percentage of the Relevant Transaction equal to or less than (if so determined
by the relevant Debtor) the percentage by which the relevant financial indebtedness has been
reduced.

**4.14 No Outstanding Transactions**

If a Hedging Agreement is terminated by the relevant Debtor in circumstances where there are no
outstanding transactions thereunder, as provided for in paragraph (a) of Clause 4.13 (Termination of
_Hedging), the Hedge Counterparty to that Hedging Agreement shall immediately cease to be a Hedge_
Counterparty in respect of that Hedging Agreement for the purposes of this Agreement and shall be
discharged from further obligations to the Parties under this Agreement in respect of that Hedging
Agreement and their respective rights against one another in respect of that Hedging Agreement shall be
cancelled (except in each case for those rights which arose prior to such termination).

**4.15 Offsetting Swaps**

A Debtor may enter into a secured hedging transaction (an “Offsetting Swap”) with a Hedge Counterparty
that has the economic effect of fully offsetting the mark to market movements of all or part of an existing
hedging transaction under a Hedging Agreement (each an “Existing Unmatured Hedge”).

**4.16 Terminations of Offsetting Swaps**

The relevant Debtor shall, and the Company shall procure that the relevant Debtor shall, promptly
terminate a proportion of any Offsetting Swap upon the termination or close-out of the corresponding
Existing Unmatured Hedge, such proportion to be equal to the proportion of such Existing Unmatured
Hedge that has been terminated.

**5.** **GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY TO HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES**

**5.1** **Guarantee and Indemnity**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss in favour of any Hedge Counterparty under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) shall only apply and take effect on and from such time as a_
Debtor provides a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss to another Senior Secured
Creditor (other than a Hedge Counterparty) under or pursuant to a Secured Debt Document.

AC-61


-----

(b) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

(i) guarantees to each Hedge Counterparty punctual performance by each other Debtor of all that
Debtor’s payment obligations under the Hedging Agreements;

(ii) undertakes with each Hedge Counterparty that whenever another Debtor does not pay any
amount when due under or in connection with any Hedging Agreement, that Debtor shall
immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

(iii) agrees with each Hedge Counterparty that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes
unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify
that Hedge Counterparty immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as
a result of a Debtor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability,
invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Hedging Agreement on the date
when it would have been due. The amount payable by a Debtor under this indemnity will not
exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to
_Hedge Counterparties) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a_
guarantee.

**5.2** **Continuing guarantee**

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any
Debtor under the Hedging Agreements, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in
part.

**5.3** **Reinstatement**

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Debtor or any
security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Hedge Counterparty in whole or in part on the
basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency,
liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Debtor under this
Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) will continue or be reinstated as if the
discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

**5.4** **Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Debtor under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)
will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 5 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties), would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this_
Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) (without limitation and whether or not
known to it or any Hedge Counterparty) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Debtor or other person;

(b) the release of any other Debtor or any other person under the terms of any composition or
arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect,
take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Debtor or other person or any
non-presentation or non- observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any
instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the
members or status of a Debtor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however fundamental and whether or
not more onerous) or replacement of a Hedging Agreement or any other document or security
including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any
amount due or the addition of any new Hedging Liability under any Hedging Agreement or other
document or security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Hedging
Agreement or any other document or security; or

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

AC-62


-----

**5.5** **Debtor Intent**

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 5.4 (Waiver of defences), each Debtor expressly confirms
that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation,
increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Hedging Agreements or amount made available under
any of the Hedging Agreements.

**5.6** **Immediate Recourse**

Each Debtor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or
agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any
person before claiming from that Debtor under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge
_Counterparties). This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Hedging Agreement to_
the contrary.

**5.7** **Appropriations**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Debtors under or in connection with the
Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full, each Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or agent
on its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that
Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and
enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or
otherwise) and no Debtor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Debtor or on account of
any Debtor’s liability under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties).

**5.8** **Deferral of Debtors’ Rights**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Debtors under or in connection with the
Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Security Agent otherwise directs, no
Debtor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under
the Hedging Agreements or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 5
(Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties):

(a) to be indemnified by a Debtor;

(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Debtor’s obligations under the Hedging
Agreements;

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights
of the Hedge Counterparties under the Hedging Agreements or of any other guarantee or security
taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Hedging Agreements by any Hedge Counterparty;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Debtor to make any payment, or
perform any obligation, in respect of which any Debtor has given a guarantee, undertaking or
indemnity under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties);

(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Debtor; and/or

(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Debtor in competition with any Hedge Counterparty.

If a Debtor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall promptly pay or
transfer the same to the Security Agent or as the Security Agent may direct for application in accordance
with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

**5.9** **Release of Debtors’ Rights of Contribution**

If any Debtor (a “Retiring Debtor”) ceases to be a Debtor in accordance with the terms of any Secured
Debt Document for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Debtor then on the date such
Retiring Debtor ceases to be a Debtor:

(a) that Retiring Debtor is released by each other Debtor from any liability (whether past, present or
future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Debtor arising by reason
of the performance by any other Debtor of its obligations under the Hedging Agreements; and

AC-63


-----

(b) each other Debtor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations
under the Hedging Agreements to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of
subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Hedge Counterparties under any Hedging Agreement
or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Hedging Agreement where
such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Debtor.

**5.10 Additional security**

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or
subsequently held by any Hedge Counterparty.

**5.11 Limitation of Liabilities of United States Guarantors**

Each Restricted Debtor and each of the Hedge Counterparties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the
guarantee under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)) hereby confirms its
intention that this guarantee should not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for the purposes of
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the United States Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any
similar Federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Restricted Debtor and each
of the Hedge Counterparties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the guarantee under this Clause 5
(Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)) hereby irrevocably agrees that its obligations under
this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) shall be limited to the maximum amount
as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of
such Restricted Debtor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any rights to
contribution pursuant to any agreement providing for an equitable contribution among such Restricted
Debtor and the other Guarantors, result in the obligations of such Restricted Debtor in respect of such
maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(d) Each Restricted Debtor formed in the state of California waives, to the extent permitted by law, for
the benefit of the Hedge Counterparties:

(i) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a
surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal;

(ii) in accordance with Section 2855 of the California Civil Code, any and all rights and defenses
available to it by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code;

(iii) any defense based upon any Hedge Counterparty’s errors or omissions in the administration of
the Hedging Agreements, except behaviour that amounts to bad faith;

(iv) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, that are or might be in conflict with
the terms of this guarantee and any legal or equitable discharge of such Restricted Debtor’s
obligations hereunder;

(v) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Restricted Debtor’s liability hereunder
or the enforcement hereof;

(vi) any rights to set offs, recoupments and counterclaims;

(vii) other than as expressly set forth in Clause 5.1 (Guarantee and Indemnity), promptness,
diligence, notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonour,
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this guarantee, notices of default
under this Agreement, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the guarantied
obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any
Borrower, notices of any of the matters referred to in Clause 5.6 (Immediate Recourse) and
any right to consent to any thereof; and

(viii) any right to revoke such Restricted Debtor’s obligations hereunder as to future obligations.

(e) Notwithstanding any term or provision of this Agreement, with respect to any US Borrower, no
direct or indirect CFC Subsidiary of such US Borrower, FSHCO or Subsidiary of either of the
foregoing shall be required to make any payment on behalf of any US Borrower; guarantee or
support the obligations of, or pledge any of its assets as security for the obligations of, any US
Borrower; and no more than 65 per cent. of the total combined voting power of all classes of all
voting stock or voting shares, or any other voting equity interest in any direct CFC Subsidiary or

AC-64


-----

FSHCO, shall be pledged as security for the obligations of any US Borrower. For these purposes,
“US Borrower” has the meaning given to such term in the Senior Facilities Agreement and any
Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as applicable), “CFC Subsidiary” means each Subsidiary of a
US Borrower that is incorporated or organised under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States or any state or territory thereof and is a “controlled foreign corporation” (within the
meaning of Section 957 of the Code) and “FSHCO” means any entity, substantially all the assets of
which consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more CFC
Subsidiaries or entities that are themselves FSHCOs.

**5.12 US Guarantors**

(a) Terms used in this clause are to be construed in accordance with the Fraudulent Transfer Laws.

(b) Each Restricted Debtor acknowledges that:

(i) it will receive valuable direct or indirect benefits as a result of the transactions financed by the
Hedging Agreements;

(ii) those benefits will constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the
purpose of any Fraudulent Transfer Law; and

(iii) each Hedge Counterparty has acted in good faith in connection with the guarantee given by
that Restricted Debtor and the transactions contemplated by the Hedging Agreements.

(c) Each Restricted Debtor formed in the state of California acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole
responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers under (and as defined
in) the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as applicable) such
information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers under (and
as defined in) the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as
applicable) as such Restricted Debtor requires.

(d) Each Hedge Counterparty agrees that each Restricted Debtor’s liability under this clause is limited
so that no obligation of, or transfer by, any Restricted Debtor under this Clause is subject to
avoidance and turnover under any Fraudulent Transfer Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any Hedging Agreement,
the obligations being guaranteed by any Debtor (by express guarantee, grant of security, or
otherwise) shall not include any Excluded Swap Obligations.

**5.13 Keepwell**

(a) Each ECP Debtor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other
Debtor to honour all of its obligations under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause 5
(Guarantee and indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) in respect of Swap Obligations (provided,
_however, that each ECP Debtor shall only be liable under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) for the_
maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations
under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell), or otherwise under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause
5 (Guarantee and indemnity to Hedge Counterparties), voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, or otherwise, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each ECP Debtor under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) shall remain in full force and
effect until the Hedging Liabilities are discharged in full. Each ECP Debtor intends that this Clause
5.13 (Keepwell) constitutes, and this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) shall be deemed to constitute, a
“keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Debtor for all purposes of
Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(b) As used in this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell), “ECP Debtor” means, in respect of any Swap Obligation,
each Debtor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant guarantee or grant of
the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or such other
person as constitutes an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act or any
regulations promulgated thereunder and can cause another person to qualify as an “eligible contract
participant” at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the
Commodity Exchange Act.

**12.7 Permitted Enforcement: Intra-Group Lenders**

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Intra-Group Lender may (unless otherwise directed by
the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action
on behalf of that Intra-Group Lender in accordance with Clause 13.5 (Filing of claims) or under the
Transaction Security Documents creating Security over the relevant Intra-Group Liabilities), exercise any
right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

**12.8 Representations: Intra-Group Lenders**

Each Intra-Group Lender which is not a Debtor represents and warrants to the Primary Creditors, the
Security Agent and the Agents on the date it becomes a Party that:

(a) it is a company duly organised or a partnership duly formed, in either case, validly existing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or establishment;

(b) subject to the Legal Reservations, the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in this Agreement
are legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations; and

(iii) any material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or binding on any of its assets,
where such violation would or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the

**13.** **EFFECT OF INSOLVENCY EVENT**

**13.1 SFA Cash Cover**

This Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency Event) is subject to Clause 18.3 (Treatment of SFA Cash Cover and

**13.2 Payment of distributions**

(a) After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any Party entitled to receive a distribution out of the

(b) The Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it under paragraph (a) above in accordance with
Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

amount of the Liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

AC-91


-----

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to:

(i) any such discharge of the Multi-account Overdraft Liabilities to the extent that the relevant
discharge represents a reduction from a Permitted Gross Amount of a Multi-account Overdraft

(ii) any Close-Out Netting by a Hedge Counterparty or a Hedging Ancillary Lender;

(iii) any Payment Netting by a Hedge Counterparty or a Hedging Ancillary Lender;

respect of any of the Liabilities (other than as contemplated in paragraph (e)(ii)(A) of Clause 17.2
(Distressed Disposals)), the Liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realisation proceeds are actually applied towards the Liabilities.

**13.5 Filing of claims**

Without prejudice to any Ancillary Facility Lender’s right of netting or set-off relating to a Multi-account
Overdraft Facility (to the extent that the netting or set-off represents a reduction from a Permitted Gross
Amount of that Multi-account Overdraft Facility to or towards its Designated Net Amount), after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Creditor irrevocably authorises the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent instructions)), on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) against that Debtor,
Security Grantor or member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that Debtor’s, Security Grantor’s or member of
the Group’s Liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that Debtor’s, Security
Grantor’s or member of the Group’s Liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that Debtor’s, Security Grantor’s or member of the Group’s Liabilities.

**13.6 Creditors’ actions**

Each Creditor will:

(a) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent
_instructions)) reasonably requests in order to give effect to this Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency_
_Event); and_

(b) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this Clause 13 (Effect
_of Insolvency Event) or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent_
_instructions)) requests that a Creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with_
the instructions of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent
_instructions)) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security_
Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent instructions)) may reasonably require,
although no Notes Trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable
the Security Agent to take such action.

**13.7 Security Agent instructions**

For the purposes of Clause 13.5 (Filing of claims) and Clause 13.6 (Creditors’ actions) the Security Agent
shall act:

(a) (except in relation to the High Yield Liabilities of a HY Issuer or HY Borrower that is not a member
of the Group) on the instructions of the group of Primary Creditors entitled, at that time, to give
instructions under Clause 16.2 (Enforcement instructions) or Clause 16.3 (Manner of enforcement);
or

AC-92

(b) in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no
actions).

**13.8 US Insolvency Proceedings: “subordination agreement”[6]**

If any Debtor commences a US Insolvency Proceeding, then this Agreement, which the Parties hereto
expressly acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code,
shall be effective during the US Insolvency Proceeding of any such Debtor.

**13.9 US Insolvency Proceedings: Reorganisation securities**

If, in any US Insolvency Proceeding of any Debtor, debt obligations of the reorganised Debtor secured by
liens upon any property of the reorganised Debtor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganisation or
similar dispositive restructuring plan, on account of the Second Lien Liabilities, then the provisions of this
Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with
like effect to the liens securing such debt obligations.

**13.10 US Insolvency Proceedings: recoveries and turnover**

(a) If any Primary Creditor is required in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any US Group Member or
otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay the bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy estate in
any such US Insolvency Proceedings, because such amount was avoided or ordered to be paid or
disgorged for any reason, including because it was found to be a fraudulent or preferential transfer,
any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of
set-off or otherwise then the Liabilities owed to such Primary Creditor shall be reinstated to the
extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the
Senior Secured Discharge Date or the Second Lien Discharge Date (as the case may be), if it shall
otherwise have occurred, shall be deemed not to have occurred.

(b) If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be
reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge,
impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties hereto.

(c) The Creditors and Debtors agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit in any manner that is
inconsistent with this Agreement from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any
distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement, whether by preference or
otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise
allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the
priorities set forth in this Agreement.

**13.11 US Insolvency Proceedings: rights as to Transaction Security and proceeds**

The relative rights as to the Transaction Security and proceeds thereof shall continue after the
commencement of any US Insolvency Proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of such
commencement, provided that:

(a) if, in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any US Group Member, the Senior Lenders (or a subset
thereof) instruct the Security Agent to consent to:

(i) any debtor-in-possession financing under section 364 of the US Bankruptcy Code that is
secured by liens (the “DIP Financing Liens”) senior to or pari passu with the liens securing
the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities (a “Bankruptcy Financing”); or

(ii) the use of cash collateral under section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code (“Section 363 Cash
**Collateral”),**

then each Second Lien Finance Party:

(A) will not object to, oppose or seek to challenge (or support or instruct the Security Agent
or any other person in objecting to, opposing or seeking to challenge) such Bankruptcy
Financing (provided it is a Qualifying Financing), the use of Section 363 Cash
Collateral or any adequate protection granted to the Senior Creditors hereunder; and

6 Clauses 13.8 to 13.14 are subject to review by local counsel.

AC-93


-----

(B) shall not object to subordination of:

(1) any liens securing the Second Lien Liabilities to such DIP Financing Liens; or

(2) any replacement liens provided to such Second Lien Finance Parties as adequate
protection to any replacement liens provided as adequate protection to the Senior
Creditors on the same terms as the liens securing the Second Lien Liabilities are
subordinated to the liens securing the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Hedging
Liabilities; and

(b) a Bankruptcy Financing shall be a “Qualifying Financing” only if:

(i) the priorities in the Transaction Security (including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of the applicable US Insolvency Proceeding) of the Security securing the
Senior Liabilities and the Security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be the same
relative to one another as existed immediately prior to the commencement of the applicable
US Insolvency Proceeding;

(ii) such Bankruptcy Financing does not compel any Debtor to seek confirmation of a specific
plan of reorganisation for which material terms are set forth in the documentation relating to
such Bankruptcy Financing (other than specifying that the Bankruptcy Financing must be paid
in full at consummation of such plan of reorganisation);

(iii) such Bankruptcy Financing does not expressly require the sale, liquidation or disposition of all
or any substantial part of the Transaction Security prior to a default under such Bankruptcy
Financing (other than a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code that meets the
criteria set out in paragraph (c) of Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals)); and

(iv) that to the extent that the Senior Liabilities are provided adequate protection in the form of
replacement collateral, the Second Lien Liabilities shall, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, be provided the same replacement collateral on a junior basis to the Senior
Liabilities; provided, that if the Second Lien Finance Parties are granted adequate protection in
the form of claims under Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, such claims shall be
subordinate in right of payment to any claim of the Senior Creditors (and to the claims of any
lenders providing any Qualifying Financing), and the Second Lien Finance Parties hereby
waive their rights under Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code and agree that such claims
may receive any treatment under a plan of reorganization which may be afforded the Second
Lien Liabilities.

**13.12 US Insolvency Proceedings: Common Transaction Security**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Security Documents, it is the intent of the
Parties that, solely for the purposes of the classification and allowance of claims in US Insolvency
Proceedings, the liens granted pursuant to the Security Documents constitute two separate and
distinct grants of liens on the Common Transaction Security, with the liens securing the Second Lien
Liabilities being subordinate and junior to the liens securing the Senior Secured Liabilities on the
terms set out in this Agreement.

(b) The Parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that because of, among other things, their
differing rights in the Common Transaction Security, the Senior Secured Liabilities are
fundamentally different from the Second Lien Liabilities and must be separately classified in any
Chapter 11 plan proposed or adopted in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any Debtor.

(c) To give effect to the intent of the Parties as provided in this Clause 13.12, if it is held that the claims
of the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors in respect of the Common Transaction
Security constitute only one class of secured claims (rather than separate classes of senior and
second lien secured claims), then the Second Lien Creditors hereby acknowledge and agree in
connection with any US Insolvency Proceedings:

(i) that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior
secured claims against members of the Group in respect of the Common Transaction Security;

(ii) that to the extent that the aggregate value of the Common Transaction Security is sufficient
(for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Second Lien Creditors), the Senior Creditors
shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal,
pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of Post-Petition Interest
before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien Creditors;

AC-94


-----

(iii) to turn over to the Security Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the
extent necessary to give effect to the intent of this Clause 13.12, even if such turnover has the
effect of reducing recovery of the Second Lien Creditors; and

(iv) until turned over to the Senior Secured Creditors, such amounts will be held in trust for the
Senior Secured Creditors.

**13.13 US Insolvency Proceedings: rights of Second Lien Finance Parties and Senior Creditors**

In connection with any US Insolvency Proceeding:

(a) each of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien Creditors, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, shall retain all rights to vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganisation,
composition, arrangement or liquidation, and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the ability of the Senior Secured Creditors or the Second Lien Creditors to make a
proposal to the Group to provide debtor-in-possession financing (including any Bankruptcy
Financing) in any US Insolvency Proceeding;

(b) the Second Lien Creditors may, in accordance with applicable law, exercise any rights and remedies
against any member of the Group which are available to unsecured creditors in US Insolvency
Proceedings which have commenced in respect of that member of the Group solely to the extent that
such exercise of rights and remedies is not in contravention of and does not have the effect of
contravening the provisions and relevant priorities set forth in this Agreement; and

(c) in the event that any Second Lien Creditor becomes a judgment lien creditor in respect of Charged
Property, such judgment lien shall be subordinated to the Security securing the Senior Secured
Liabilities on the same basis as the other Security securing the Second Lien Liabilities are so
subordinated to such Security securing the Senior Secured Liabilities under this Agreement provided
that any proceeds of any such lien shall be applied in the same way as any amounts received or
recovered by the Secured Parties are required to be applied under the terms of this Agreement.

**13.14 US Insolvency Proceedings: disposal of Transaction Security**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Second Lien Creditors will not contest,
protest, or object, and will be deemed to have consented pursuant to Section 363(f) of the US Bankruptcy
Code, to a disposal of Transaction Security, or the process or procedures for obtaining bids for and
effecting a disposal of Transaction Security (including the right of the Senior Secured Creditors to credit
bid and the retention by the Obligors of professionals in connection with any potential disposal), or any
motion or order in connection with any such disposal, process or procedures, under Section 363 of the US
Bankruptcy Code (or any other provision of the US Bankruptcy Code or applicable US Bankruptcy Law),
if the relevant Agent or Security Agent acting on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors consents to such
disposal, such process or procedures or such motion or order; provided that (a) either (i) pursuant to court
order, the Security of the Second Lien Creditors attach to the net proceeds of the disposal with the same
priority and validity as the Security held by the Second Lien Creditors on such Transaction Security, and
the Security remains subject to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) the net proceeds of a disposal of
Transaction Security received by the Security Agent on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors in excess of
those necessary to achieve the full and final discharge of Senior Secured Liabilities are distributed in
accordance with the UCC and applicable law, and (b) the net cash proceeds of any disposition under
Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code are permanently applied to the Bankruptcy Financing or to the
Senior Secured Liabilities or are set aside for a wind-down, liquidation or similar fund. Nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude the Second Lien Creditors from credit bidding all or any portion of the Second
Lien Liabilities provided that any such bid contemplates the payment in full in cash of all Senior Secured
Liabilities at closing of any such bid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Second Lien Agent, on behalf of
itself and the other Second Lien Creditors it represents, may raise any objections to any such disposal that
could be raised by any creditor of the Obligors whose claims were not secured by any Security on such
Transaction Security, provided such objections are not inconsistent with any other term or provision of this
Agreement and are not based on the status of the Second Lien Agent or the Second Lien Creditors as
secured creditors (without limiting the foregoing, the Second Lien Creditors may not raise any objections
based on rights afforded by Sections 363(e) and (f) of the US Bankruptcy Code to secured creditors (or by
any comparable provision of any US Bankruptcy Law)) with respect to the Security granted to the Second
Lien Creditors.

AC-95

**13.15 Limitation by Applicable Laws**

(a) Each of the provisions of this Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency Event) shall apply only to the extent
permitted by applicable laws.

(b) Nothing in this Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency Event):

(i) entitles any Party to exercise or require any other Party to exercise such power or voting or
representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or reschedule any
of the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities or the Hedging Liabilities or the Second Lien
Liabilities; or

(ii) shall be deemed to require any Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors, High Yield
Creditors or Unsecured Creditors to hold a meeting of the relevant Creditors or pass any
resolution at such meeting or give any consent pursuant to the terms of the relevant Secured
Debt Documents, High Yield Finance Documents or Unsecured Creditors.

of such receipt and recoveries shall be construed as one of principal and agent.

(a) Any amount paid by a Creditor (a “Recovering Creditor”) to the Security Agent under Clause 13
(Effect of Insolvency Event) or Clause 14 (Turnover of Receipts) shall be treated as having been paid

Recovering Creditor for its proportion of any interest on the Shared Amount which that
Recovering Creditor is required to pay) (the “Redistributed Amount”); and

(ii) as between the relevant Debtor or Security Grantor and each relevant Sharing Creditor, an
amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by
that Debtor or Security Grantor.

Security Grantor, owing to each Creditor) have been irrevocably paid in full.

the Transaction Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group,

and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Security Grantor to make a

Security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under
Clause 8.12 (Permitted Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors).

(d) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph (c) if at any time the Majority Second Lien Creditors are
then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security pursuant to
the preceding paragraph (c) and the Majority Second Lien Creditors either give such instructions or
indicate any intention to give such instructions, then either the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured
Notes Representative(s) may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security as such Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Representative(s) sees fit in lieu of any
instructions to enforce given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors under Clause 8.12 (Permitted
_Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors) and the Security Agent shall act on the first such instructions_
received from the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Representative(s).

(e) The Security Agent is entitled to rely on and comply with instructions given, or deemed to be given,
in accordance with this Clause 16.2 (Enforcement instructions).

_instructions), received instructions given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the_
Transaction Security; and

(ii) the Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the
Transaction Security,

the Majority Second Lien Creditors shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the
Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

**16.4 Exercise of voting rights**

(a) Each Intra-Group Lender agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of

similar proceedings relating to any Debtor or member of the Group or any Security Grantor as
instructed by the Security Agent.

(b) The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of paragraph (a) above as directed by an
Instructing Group.

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to Clause 16.2 (Enforcement instructions),
Clause 16.3 (Manner of enforcement), Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) and paragraph (c) of
Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals), each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors and Security Grantors waives
all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order
or manner or at any particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of
the enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other Security, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied.

**16.6 Duties owed**

Each of the Secured Parties, Security Grantors and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the
Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the Transaction Security prior to the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any Receiver or Delegate owed to any Second Lien
Finance Party or High Yield Creditor in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of
the exploitation, management or realisation of any of that Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph
(c) of Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals), be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the
Security Agent, the Receiver or Delegate to the Debtors and Security Grantors under general law.

**16.7 Security held by other Creditors**

If any Transaction Security is held by a Creditor other than the Security Agent, then Creditors may only
enforce that Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group in
accordance with this Clause 16.7 (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed
as references to that Creditor).

**16.8 Consultation Period**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to (i) enforce
the Transaction Security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors
represented in the Instructing Group concerned shall consult with each other Agent and the Security
Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of up to
10 days (or such shorter period as each other Agent and the Security Agent shall agree) (the

Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to (A) enforce the Transaction
Security or (B) take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above and the Instructing
Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

AC-100


-----

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group
determines in good faith (and notifies each Agent and the Security Agent) that to enter into
such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction
Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(B) the realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

Hedging Agreement on or prior to the Enforcement Date:

**19.2 Implementation of equalisation**

The provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation) shall be applied at such time or times after the
Enforcement Date as the Security Agent shall consider appropriate. Without prejudice to the generality of
the preceding sentence, if the provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation) have been applied before all the
Liabilities have matured and/or been finally quantified, the Security Agent may elect to re-apply those
provisions on the basis of revised Exposures and the Senior Secured Creditors shall make appropriate
adjustment payments amongst themselves.

**19.3 Equalisation**

If, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective
Exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate Exposures of all the Senior Secured Creditors at
the Enforcement Date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of Notes Trustee Amounts, to
paragraphs (a) and (c) of Clause 30.2 (Liability)) will make such payments amongst themselves as the
Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking into
account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

and/or the Second Lien Creditors but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such
Creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, are
subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Senior Secured Creditors; and

(b) the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet
occurred (nor would occur after taking into account such payments),

then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Second
Lien Creditors as the Security Agent shall require to place the Senior Secured Creditors in the position they
would have been in had such amounts been available for application against the Senior Secured Liabilities.

**19.5 Notification of Exposure**

Before each occasion on which it intends to implement the provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation), the
Security Agent shall send notice to each Hedge Counterparty, the Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior
Lenders), each Senior Secured Notes Representative (on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Creditors) and

shall be entitled (but not obliged) to take action on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditor(s) to whom such

(a) In this Clause 21.3 (Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)):

“Secured Party Claim” means any amount which a Debtor owes to a Secured Party under or in
connection with the Secured Debt Documents.

“Security Agent Claim” has the meaning given to it in paragraph (b) below.

(b) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Security Agent, as an
independent and separate creditor, an amount equal to each Secured Party Claim owed by such
Debtor on the due date of such Secured Party Claim (the “Security Agent Claims”).

(c) Each Security Agent Claim is created on the understanding that the Security Agent must:

(i) share the proceeds of each Security Agent Claim with the other Secured Parties; and

(ii) pay those proceeds to the Secured Parties in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of
_Proceeds)._

(d) The Security Agent may enforce performance of any Security Agent Claim in its own name as an
independent and separate right. This includes any suit, execution, enforcement of security, recovery
of guarantees and applications for and voting in respect of any kind of insolvency proceeding.

(e) Each Secured Party must, at the request of the Security Agent, (i) enforce its Secured Party Claim
and (ii) perform any act required in connection with the enforcement of any Security Agent Claim.
This includes joining in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Security Agent.

(f) Unless the Security Agent fails to enforce a Security Agent Claim within a reasonable time after its
due date, a Secured Party may not take any action to enforce the corresponding Secured Party Claim
unless it is requested to do so by the Security Agent.

(g) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to require a Secured Party
to join in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Security Agent in respect of any Security Agent
Claim.

Claim in the same amount.

(j) The aggregate amount of the Security Agent Claims will never exceed the aggregate amount of
Secured Party Claims.

(l) A defect affecting a Secured Party Claim against a debtor will not affect any Security Agent Claim.

(m) If the Security Agent returns to any Debtor, whether in any kind of insolvency proceedings or
otherwise, any recovery in respect of which it has made a payment to a Secured Party, that Secured
Party must repay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent.

(n) Without limiting or affecting the Security Agent’s rights against any Debtor (whether under this
Clause 21.3 (Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)) or under any other provision of the
Secured Debt Documents or High Yield Finance Documents), the Security Agent agrees with each
other Secured Party (on a several and divided basis) that it will not exercise its rights in respect of
the Security Agent Claims except with the consent of the Instructing Group. However, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in the previous sentence shall in any way limit the Security Agent’s
right to act in the protection or preservation of rights under any Transaction Security Document or to
enforce any Transaction Security as contemplated by this Agreement, the relevant Transaction
Security Document or any other Secured Debt Documents or High Yield Finance Documents (or to
do any act reasonably incidental to the foregoing).

Facilities Agreement and/or any Second Lien Facilities Agreement) except through the Security Agent.

**21.5 Instructions to Security Agent and exercise of discretion**

(a) Subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) below, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with any

of a Security Agent Claim and shall be entitled to assume that (i) any instructions received by it from
an Agent, the Creditors or a group of Creditors are duly given in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Documents and (ii) unless it has received actual notice of revocation, that those instructions or
directions have not been revoked.

(b) The Security Agent shall be entitled to request instructions, or clarification of any direction, from an
Instructing Group (or from the Majority Second Lien Creditors (to the extent it is entitled to give
instructions to the Security Agent pursuant to Clause 16 (Enforcement of Transaction Security)) as to
whether, and in what manner, it should exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, powers,
authorities and discretions and the Security Agent may refrain from acting unless and until those
instructions or clarification are received by it.

(c) Save in the case of decisions stipulated to be a matter for any other Creditor or group of Creditors
under this Agreement (including Clause 16 (Enforcement of Transaction Security)) and unless a
contrary intention appears in this Agreement, any instructions given to the Security Agent by an
Instructing Group shall override any conflicting instructions given by any other Parties.

(d) Any instructions or votes given or to be given to the Security Agent by any Creditor shall be
provided by that Creditor’s Agent in relation to the relevant Liabilities or, in the case of Hedging
Liabilities, by the relevant Hedge Counterparty and the Security Agent shall be entitled to

communicate with any Creditor or Creditors (other than Hedge Counterparties) other than through
such Creditor(s’) Agent.

limitation, the provisions set out in Clauses 21.7 (Security Agent’s discretions) to 21.22
(Disapplication); and

(C) Clause 18.2 (Prospective liabilities);

(D) Clause 18.3 (Treatment of SFA Cash Cover and Senior Lender Cash Collateral); and

(E) Clause 18.6 (Permitted Deductions).

(f) If giving effect to instructions given by an Instructing Group would (in the Security Agent’s good
faith opinion) have an effect equivalent to an Intercreditor Amendment, the Security Agent shall not
act in accordance with those instructions unless Consent to it so acting is obtained from each Party
(other than the Security Agent) whose Consent would have been required in respect of that
Intercreditor Amendment.

(g) In exercising any discretion to exercise a right, power or authority under this Agreement where
either:

(i) it has not received any instructions from an Instructing Group as to the exercise of that
discretion; or

the Security Agent shall:

(A) other than where paragraph (B) below applies, do so having regard to the interests of all
the Secured Parties; or

interests of all the Senior Secured Creditors;

Date, do so having regard only to the interests of the Second Lien Creditors; or

Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 16 (Enforcement of Transaction Security) and Clause 21.5

powers and duties under the Debt Documents as it considers in its good faith discretion to be appropriate.

**21.7 Security Agent’s discretions**

The Security Agent may:

(a) assume (unless it has received actual notice to the contrary from a Hedge Counterparty or from one
of the Agents) that (i) no Default has occurred and no Debtor or Security Grantor is in breach of or
default under its obligations under any of the Debt Documents and (ii) any right, power, authority or
discretion vested by any Debt Document in any person has not been exercised;

AC-118

take any action in relation to the Transaction Security, assume that all applicable conditions under
the Debt Documents for taking that action have been satisfied;

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, its obligations hereunder (if any) to make

acknowledged and agreed that no Notes Trustee shall have any responsibility for the actions of any
individual Creditor or Noteholder (save in respect of its own actions).

opinion of counsel or opinion of another qualified expert, at the expense of the Company or another
Debtor.

**31.** **COUNTERPARTS**

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and this has the same effect as if the

Notwithstanding any other term of any Debt Document or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the Parties, each Party acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any Party to

relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of:

any accrued but unpaid interest) in respect of any such liability;

**33.** **QFC CREDIT SUPPORT**

To the extent that the Secured Debt Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any
Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit
**Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with**
respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together
with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such
Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the
Secured Debt Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the
State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes
subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC
and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported
QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the
transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the
laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act
Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, Default Rights under the Secured Debt Documents that might otherwise apply to such
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the
U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Secured Debt Documents were
governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a

not apply to Facility AA, that the applicable rate per annum for the purposes of Clause 28.2 (Default Rate)
of the Credit Agreement shall be the sum of [one] per cent. and such fixed rate of [Š] per cent. per annum
and that no obligation to pay any Break Costs shall arise in connection with any prepayment of Facility

principal amount of Facility AA (such original principal amount to include any upsizing of Facility AA
pursuant to paragraph 26 below) during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, the
Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AA Lender) an
amount equal to 3.0% of the principal amount of Facility AA being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest
then due on the amount of Facility AA prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment. Such payment
shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AA
Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment. Prior to April 15, 2027, to the extent that during any twelvemonth period commencing on the Issue Date, the principal amount of Facility AA prepaid in one or more
voluntary prepayments is greater than an amount equal to 10% of the original principal amount of Facility
AA (such original principal amount to include any upsizing of Facility AA pursuant to paragraph 26 below)
(any such amount, the “Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Borrower will apply the Excess Early
Redemption Proceeds to a voluntary prepayment of Facility AA as described in paragraph 21 below.

20. A voluntary prepayment of Facility AA in accordance with Clause 11.1(a) (Voluntary Prepayment) of the
Credit Agreement may be made by the Borrower in whole or in part but if in part, by a minimum amount

AA Lender) an amount equal to the Additional Amount (as defined below), plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the amount of Facility AA prepaid, in each case, to, and including the due date of prepayment.

Additional Facility AA Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

with paragraph 22 below in respect of the principal amount of Facility AA being prepaid if such
amount were prepaid on April 15, 2027 pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit
Agreement exclusive of any accrued but unpaid interest, plus (ii) the principal amount of Facility
AA being prepaid plus (iii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on the principal
amount of Facility AA being prepaid through April 15, 2027 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest
to, and including, the prepayment date and assuming such interest payments are calculated at the rate
of interest on Facility AA in effect on such prepayment date), computed using a discount rate equal
to the Bund Rate plus 50 basis points; over

(b) the principal amount of Facility AA being prepaid.

“Bund Rate” means, with respect to any prepayment date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual
equivalent yield to maturity as of such date of the Comparable German Bund Issue, assuming a price for
the Comparable German Bund Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the
Comparable German Bund Price for such prepayment date, where:

“Comparable German Bund Issue” means the German Bundesanleihe security selected by any Reference
German Bund Dealer as having a fixed maturity most nearly equal to the period from such prepayment
date to April 15, 2027 and that would be utilized at the time of selection and in accordance with customary
financial practice, in pricing new issues of euro-denominated corporate debt securities in a principal
amount approximately equal to the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes and of a maturity most
nearly equal to April 15, 2027; provided, however, that, if the period from such prepayment date to
April 15, 2027 is not equal to the fixed maturity of the German Bundesanleihe security selected by such
Reference German Bund Dealer, the Bund Rate shall be determined by linear interpolation (calculated to
the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of German Bundesanleihe securities for which such
yields are given, except that if the period from such prepayment date to April 15, 2027, is less than one
year, a fixed maturity of one year shall be used;

“Comparable German Bund Price” means, with respect to any prepayment date, the average of all

all such quotations;

“Reference German Bund Dealer” means any dealer of German Bundesanleihe securities appointed by
the Borrower in good faith; and

Frankfurt am Main, Germany, time on a day no earlier than the third Business Day preceding the date of
the delivery of the redemption notice in respect of such prepayment date.

of the principal amount of Facility AA being prepaid as set out in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid
interest then due on the amount of Facility AA prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment, if
prepaid during the twelve-month period beginning on 15 April of the years indicated below.

plus any premium paid or less any discount received by the Additional Facility AA Lender in
connection with the purchase of the Notes in such Tender Offer, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
to, and including, the date that any interest accrues under the Notes in connection with such

Clause 2(a) (Amendment of the Group ICA, High Yield ICA and Security Trust Agreement) of this

Agreement) of this Deed and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Finance
Document entered into prior to the Effective Date, in the case of any inconsistency or conflict

of the Amended Group ICA shall prevail.

(d) Where paragraph or Clause numbers have changed in the Original Senior Facilities Agreement as a
result of amendments to the Original Senior Facilities Agreement prior to the Effective Date, and
such paragraph and Clause numbers are referred to in any other Finance Document in force on the
Effective Date, such paragraph or Clause numbers shall be read and construed in the Original Senior
Facilities Agreement, for the purposes of the relevant Finance Document only, so that the equivalent
provision in the Original Senior Facilities Agreement (as at the Effective Date) is instead referred to
in each such Finance Document.

**2.** **AMENDMENT** **OF** **THE** **GROUP** **ICA,** **HIGH** **YIELD** **ICA** **AND** **SECURITY** **TRUST**
**AGREEMENT**

(a) With effect on and from the Effective Date, the Group ICA, the High Yield ICA and the Security

be in effect in the form set out at Schedule 2 (Amended Group ICA) to this Deed.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, to the extent relevant in respect of any Pre-Effective Date
Security Documents, the definitions of “Beneficiaries”, “Designated Secured Obligations” and
“Secured Obligations” (in the Group ICA and the Security Trust Agreement) and all other
definitions in the Group ICA and Security Trust Agreement (to the extent they are used within the
definitions of “Beneficiaries”, “Designated Secured Obligations” and “Secured Obligations” in the
Group ICA and Security Trust Agreement) shall remain in full force and effect.
