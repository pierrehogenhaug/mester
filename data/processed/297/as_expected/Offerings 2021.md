The information in the attached offering memorandum is not complete and may be changed. The materials
relating to the offering of the Notes do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering of the Notes be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the

such jurisdiction.

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the
U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

Sterling Notes with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. Prior to July 15, 2026, during each 12-month period commencing on the Issue Date, up to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Dollar Notes and/or the Sterling Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of redemption.

Following a Change of Control (as defined in the VM Credit Facility), the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will be required, at the
election of the Instructing Group under (and as defined in) the VM Credit Facility, to prepay the New Finco Loans at a price equal to 101% of

Loan’s pro rata share of the amount of the applicable available proceeds from the related asset sale) or (ii) subject to the payment of certain premiums,

respect of amounts received by the Issuer under the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements. In each case where amounts of principal, interest and

The Issuer, Virgin Media Inc. (“Virgin Media”), O2 Holdings Limited (“O2 Holdings”), the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates make no assurances as to (i) whether the Notes offered hereby will meet investor
criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance for any investors,
(ii) whether the net proceeds will be used for the VM Eligible Green Projects, (iii) the characteristics of the VM
Eligible Green Projects, including their environmental and sustainability criteria or (iv) the suitability of the
Second-Party Opinion (as defined herein) or the Notes to fulfill such environmental and sustainability criteria.
The Initial Purchasers have not undertaken, nor are responsible for, any assessment of the VMED O2 Green
Bond Framework or the VM Eligible Green Projects, any verification of whether the VM Eligible Green Projects
meet the eligibility criteria of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework or any monitoring of the use of proceeds.
The Second-Party Opinion is not incorporated into and does not form part of this offering memorandum. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all
_investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the_
_Structure—Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from_
_the offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy_
_related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers are offering to sell the Notes only in places where offers and sales are
permitted. The Issuer is offering the Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering.
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the
SEC or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering
memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

This offering memorandum is a confidential document that is being provided for informational use solely in
connection with consideration of a purchase of the Notes (i) to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be
QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers and (ii) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions complying
with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S. The use of this offering memorandum for any other purpose is not
authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part nor may it be
distributed or any of its contents be disclosed to anyone other than QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers
described in (i) above or to persons considering a purchase of the Notes in offshore transactions described in
(ii) above.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Plan of Distribution” and
“Transfer Restrictions”. By purchasing any Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described in those sections of this offering memorandum. You may be
required to bear the financial risks of investing in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.

counsel, accountant and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial, regulatory and related aspects of a
purchase of the Notes. You are responsible for making your own examination of us and your own assessment of
the merits and risks of investing in the Notes. We are not, and the Initial Purchasers are not, making any
representations to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes made by you.

The information contained in this offering memorandum (including the information incorporated by
reference herein) has been furnished by us and other sources we believe to be reliable. No representation or
warranty, express or implied, is made by the Initial Purchasers or any of its affiliates as to the accuracy,
adequacy, truthfulness or completeness of any of the information set out in this offering memorandum or
incorporated by reference herein, and nothing contained in this offering memorandum or incorporated by
reference herein is or shall be relied upon as a promise or representation by the Initial Purchasers or any of its
affiliates, whether as to the past or the future. This offering memorandum (including the information
incorporated by reference herein) contains summaries, believed to be accurate, of some of the terms of specified
documents, but reference is made to the actual documents, copies of which will be made available by us upon
request, for the complete information contained in those documents. Copies of such documents and other
information relating to the issuance of the Notes will also be available for inspection at the specified offices of
the paying agent. All summaries of the documents contained herein are qualified in their entirety by this
reference. You agree to the foregoing by accepting this offering memorandum.

Each of the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings and the JV Holdco accepts responsibility for the information
contained in this offering memorandum (including the information incorporated by reference herein) and has

information contained in this offering memorandum (including the information incorporated by reference herein)
is true, accurate and complete in all material respects, that the opinions and intentions expressed in this offering
memorandum (including the information incorporated by reference herein) are honestly held, and none of the
Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings or the JV Holdco is aware of any other facts the omission of which would
make this offering memorandum (including the information incorporated by reference herein) or any statement
contained herein misleading in any material respect, as of the date hereof.

No person is authorized in connection with any offering made pursuant to this offering memorandum to give
any information or to make any representation not contained in this offering memorandum (including the

must not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers. The information contained in
this offering memorandum is current at the date hereof, and the information incorporated by reference herein is
current as of the date of such incorporated document. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum at any

by reference herein or in our affairs since the date of this offering memorandum or the date of the relevant
incorporated document.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time, and we and the Initial Purchasers
reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to you less
than the full amount of Notes subscribed for by you.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes may be restricted by law
in some jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes come must
inform themselves about, and observe any restrictions on the transfer and exchange of the Notes. See “Plan of
_Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”._

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase
any of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it
is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in
which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess this offering memorandum. You must also obtain any consents

or approvals that you need in order to purchase any Notes. The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers or any of their
affiliates are not responsible for your compliance with these legal requirements. You may be required to bear the
financial risks of investing in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.

**STABILIZATION**

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC, FOR THE DOLLAR
NOTES, AND BARCLAYS BANK PLC, FOR THE STERLING NOTES (TOGETHER, THE “STABILIZING
**MANAGERS”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGERS), MAY OVER-**
ALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE
OF THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL.
HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING MANAGERS (OR PERSONS
ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGERS) WILL UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION
ACTION. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH
ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE NOTES IS MADE
AND, IF BEGUN, MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN THE
EARLIER OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE AND 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE
ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES.

If issued, the Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. The Notes will be represented on
issue by one or more global notes, which will be delivered through, in the case of the Dollar Notes, DTC and, in
the case of the Sterling Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Issuer expects that the Notes offered and sold in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified
Purchasers in reliance upon Rule 144A will be represented by beneficial interests in one or more permanent
global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons. The Issuer expects that the Notes offered and sold
outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S will be initially represented by beneficial
interests in one or more temporary global notes in registered global form. Interests in the temporary Regulation S
global notes will be exchangeable for interests in one or more corresponding permanent Regulation S global
notes in registered global form not earlier than the later of (i) the “distribution compliance period” as defined in
Regulation S and (ii) the first day on which certification of non-U.S. ownership is provided to the Trustee as
described under “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance—Transfers”.

**NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS**

Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this offering memorandum under “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes
have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the
United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and resale. Prospective purchasers are hereby
notified that the seller of any new Note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer
of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By
accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or
indirectly, any new Note to the public.

**NOTICE TO EU INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis of an exemption provided by Preamble 14 (and
Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “EU Prospectus Regulation”), stating that the
mere admission of securities to trading on the multilateral trading facility (as defined in point (22) of article 4(1)
of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”)), is not to be regarded in itself as an offer of securities to the
public and is therefore not subject to the obligation to draw up, approve and distribute the prospectus as required
by the EU Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do any of them
authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

-----

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The notes are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs regulation.

**MIFID** **II** **PRODUCT** **GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL** **INVESTORS** **AND** **ECPS** **ONLY**
**TARGET MARKET: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target**
market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“U.K. MiFIR”); and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to our obligations in accordance with
U.K. MiFIR, a distributor subject to U.K. MiFIR is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Austria. This offering memorandum has not been and will not be approved and/or published pursuant to the_**

accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, nor may copies of this offering
memorandum or any other offering memorandum, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering

the Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as
amended from time to time (“Regulation No. 11971”), and the applicable Italian laws.

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this offering memorandum or any other

(a) made by an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to conduct such activities in the
Republic of Italy in accordance with the Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended
(the “Financial Services Act”), CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of 15 February 2018, as amended
(“Regulation No. 20307”) and Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended (the

(b) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirement imposed by CONSOB,
the Bank of Italy (including the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of

such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**_Ireland. No action may be taken with respect to the Notes in Ireland otherwise than in conformity with the_**
provisions of (i) the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 (as amended, the
“MiFID Regulations”), including, without limitation, Regulation 5 (Requirement for Authorization) thereof or
any codes of conduct made under the MiFID Regulations and the provisions of the Investor Compensation Act
1998 (as amended), (ii) the Companies Act 2014 (as amended, the “Companies Act”), the Central Bank Acts
1942 to 2015 (as amended) and any codes of conduct rules made under Section 117(1) of the Central Bank Act
1989, (iii) the European Union (Prospectus) Regulations 2019 (as amended) (the “Irish Prospectus
**Regulations”) and any rules issued under Section 1363 of the Companies Act by the Central Bank of Ireland and**
(iv) the Market Abuse Regulations (EU 596/2014) (as amended) and any rules or guidance issued by the Central
Bank of Ireland under Section 1370 of the Companies Act. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that, to the extent any offer is made in Ireland, any offer of the Notes will be made pursuant to one or more
of the exemptions in Regulation 9(1) of the Irish Prospectus Regulations from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in Ireland of
the Notes which are subject of the offering contemplated in this offering memorandum may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Regulation 12 of the Irish Prospectus Regulations or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Regulation
51 of the Irish Prospectus Regulations, in each case, in relation to such offer. None of the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers have authorized, or authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes in circumstances in which an
obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.

submitted for approval to the Luxembourg Supervision Commission of the Financial Sector (Commission de
_Surveillance du Secteur Financier) for purposes of a public offering or sale in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg_
(“Luxembourg”). Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in Luxembourg, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular, prospectus, form of application,
advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made available in or from, or published in,
Luxembourg except in circumstances which do not constitute a public offer of securities to the public, subject to
prospectus requirements, in accordance with the Luxembourg Act of July 10, 2005 on prospectuses for securities,
as amended (the “Prospectus Act”) and implementing the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, this offering

(ii) no more than 149 prospective investors, which are not qualified investors.

Federal Code of Obligations. No key information document according to the Swiss Financial Services Act
(“FinSA”) or any equivalent document under the FinSA has been prepared in relation to the Notes, and,

**NOTICE TO U.K. INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis of an exemption provided by Preamble 14 (and
Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA (the “U.K.
**Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering**
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the U.K. of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do any of them
authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum is being distributed only to and directed only at (i) persons who are outside the

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the
U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. MIFID PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY**
**TARGET MARKET: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market**
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take

viii


-----

into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO CANADIAN INVESTORS**

The Pro Forma Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, do not purport to

Financial Statements have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the VM Annual Combined
Financial Statements, the VM Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements, the O2 Annual Consolidated
Financial Statements and the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, incorporated by

reference or included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Pro Forma Financial Statements should also
be read in conjunction with the Issuer Annual Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma
financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards. For additional information, see “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements of
_JV Holdco”._

The Pro Forma Financial Statements are limited to certain financial statement items. As such, the Pro Forma
Financial Statements may not be comparable to the Issuer Annual Financial Statements, the VM Annual
Combined Financial Statements, the VM Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements, the O2 Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements, the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or the other
financial information incorporated by reference or included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and should
not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

**Other Financial Measures**

**_Virgin Media Group_**

In this offering memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein we present “Segment
Adjusted EBITDA” and “OFCF” of the Virgin Media Group, which are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are the primary measures used by the
Virgin Media Group’s chief operating decision maker and management to evaluate the operating performance of
its businesses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are also key factors that are used by the Virgin Media
Group’s internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of
its management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As the Virgin Media Group uses
the term, “Segment Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings (loss) before net income tax benefit (expense),
other non-operating income or expenses, net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) due to changes in fair value of certain debt, net foreign currency gains (losses), net realized and
unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net interest expense, net interest income, depreciation and
amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and
impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the
disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful
acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other
acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. As the Virgin
Media Group uses the term, “OFCF” is defined as Segment Adjusted EBITDA less property and equipment
additions. The Virgin Media Group’s internal decision makers believe Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are
meaningful measures because they represent a transparent view of the Virgin Media Group’s recurring operating
performance that is unaffected by its capital structure and allows management to (a) readily view operating
trends and (b) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the U.K. and Ireland. The Virgin Media
Group believes its Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF measures, which are non-GAAP measures, are useful
to investors because they are each a basis for comparing the Virgin Media Group’s performance with the
performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although the Virgin Media Group’s measures
may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA
and OFCF should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute
for U.S. GAAP measures of income or loss. Reconciliations of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF to the
most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is provided in this offering memorandum. See
“Summary Financial and Operating Data of the Virgin Media Group”.

**_O2 Group_**

In this offering memorandum we present “OIBDA”, “OIBDA Margin”, “OIBDA-CapEx”, “OIBDA-CapEx
Margin” and “Net debt” of the O2 Group, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS.
OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx, OIBDA-CapEx Margin and Net debt are the primary measures used
by the O2 Group to evaluate the operating performance of its businesses, make decisions about allocating
resources and to establish operating and strategic targets. As the O2 Group uses the term, OIBDA is calculated
by excluding depreciation and amortization from operating profit. OIBDA Margin is OIBDA calculated as a
percentage of revenue. OIBDA-CapEx is calculated as OIBDA minus capital expenditures. OIBDA-CapEx
Margin is OIBDA-CapEx calculated as a percentage of revenue. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and
cash equivalents from total borrowings. Such measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with,
IFRS. The O2 Group believes such measures are useful to investors as they provide one basis for comparing the

xix


-----

O2 Group’s performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although
such measures as defined by the O2 Group may not be directly comparable to the same or similar measures used
by other companies. Such measures should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating profit, net cash inflow from operating activities and other IFRS
measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of OIBDA to operating profit is provided in this offering
memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of
_the O2 Group—Special Note Regarding Non-IFRS Measures”._

**_Joint Venture_**

In this offering memorandum we present “Annualized pro forma EBITDA”, “As adjusted annualized pro
forma EBITDA”, “As adjusted total covenant senior net debt”, “As adjusted total covenant net debt”, “Ratio of
as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA”, “Ratio of as adjusted
total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA”, “SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA”, “SHA
total net debt” and “Ratio of SHA total net debt to SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA” of the JV Holdco, which are
not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS. The Joint Venture believes such measures
are useful to investors as they provide one basis for comparing the Joint Venture’s performance with the
performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although such measures as defined by the Joint
Venture may not be directly comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies. Such
measures should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute
for, operating profit, net cash inflow from operating activities and other IFRS measures of income or cash flows.
See “Certain Pro Forma As Adjusted Covenant and Other Information”.

**Non-Financial Key Operating Performance Data**

**_Virgin Media Group_**

Each of the Virgin Media Group’s subscribers is counted as a revenue generating unit (“RGU”) for each
broadband communication service subscribed. Thus, a subscriber who receives broadband internet, digital cable
television and fixed-line telephony services from us (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would
be counted as three RGUs. The Virgin Media Group’s mobile subscribers are counted based on the number of
subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service. The subscriber data of the Virgin Media Group
included in this offering memorandum, including RGUs and average revenue per user (“VM ARPU”), are
determined by the Virgin Media Group’s management, are not part of the VM Annual Combined Financial
Statements or the VM Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements and have not been audited or
otherwise reviewed by an outside independent auditor, consultant or expert or by any of the Initial Purchasers.

**_O2 Group_**

Each connection to any of the O2 Group’s telecommunications services is referred to as an “access”. The
O2 Group believes that it is more useful to count the number of accesses a customer has contracted for, rather
than to count only the number of its customers, who may have multiple fixed or mobile accesses. As such, a
customer that has a fixed-line telephony service and a mobile service is counted as two accesses. The subscriber
data of the O2 Group included in this offering memorandum, including accesses and average revenue per user
(“O2 ARPU”), are determined by the O2 Group’s management, are not part of the O2 Annual Consolidated
Financial Statements or the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and have not been audited
or otherwise reviewed by an outside independent auditor, consultant or expert or by any of the Initial Purchasers.

**Third-Party Information**

The information provided in this offering memorandum, or incorporated by reference herein, on the market
environment, market developments, growth rates, market trends and on the competitive situation in the markets
and segments in which we operate are based (to the extent not otherwise indicated) on third-party data, statistical
information and reports as well as our own internal estimates.

Market studies are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be exact or appropriate,
and their methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. This offering memorandum also contains
estimates made by us based on third-party market data, which in turn is based on published market data or figures
from publicly available sources.

-----

Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have verified the figures, market data or other information on which
third parties have based their studies nor have such third parties verified the external sources on which such
estimates are based. Therefore, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers guarantee nor do we or the Initial Purchasers
assume responsibility for the accuracy of the information from third-party studies presented in this offering
memorandum or incorporated by reference herein or for the accuracy of the information on which such estimates
are based.

This offering memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein also contain estimates of
market data and information derived therefrom which cannot be gathered from publications by market research
institutions or any other independent sources. Such information is based on our internal estimates. In many cases
there is no publicly available information on such market data, for example from industry associations, public
authorities or other organizations and institutions. We believe that these internal estimates of market data and
information derived therefrom are helpful in order to give investors a better understanding of the industry in
which we operate as well as our position within this industry. Although we believe that our internal market
observations are reliable, our estimates are not reviewed or verified by any external sources. We assume no
responsibility for the accuracy of our estimates and the information derived therefrom. These may deviate from
estimates made by our competitors or future statistics provided by market research institutes or other independent
sources. We cannot assure you that our estimates or the assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect the state and
development of, or our position in, the industry.

_for a glossary of technical terms used in this offering memorandum._

**Joint Venture Overview**

On May 7, 2020, Liberty Global and Telefónica, among others, entered into the Contribution Agreement
and agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture combining Virgin Media’s operations in the U.K. with O2 Holdings’
operations in the U.K. (the “Joint Venture”). The Virgin Media Group’s operations in Ireland (“VM Ireland”)
and certain other less significant operations of the Virgin Media Group are not part of the Joint Venture. The
Joint Venture was consummated on June 1, 2021 (the “JV Closing Date”). See “—The Transactions—Joint
_Venture Transactions”._

The Joint Venture combines the Virgin Media Group’s U.K. fiber-rich broadband network with the O2
Group’s leading mobile operations to create a leading telecommunications provider in the U.K. As of March 31,
2021, on a combined pro forma basis, the Joint Venture would have had 46.5 million video, broadband and
mobile subscribers. For more information regarding the subscriber data for the Joint Venture, see “Unaudited
_Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements of JV Holdco”._

We believe the Joint Venture benefits from the combined operations of the Virgin Media Group and the O2
Group as follows:

    - well penetrated broadband and digital TV markets, which, together with the potential to migrate mobile
customers from prepaid to postpaid contracts, supports opportunities for fixed-mobile convergence;

    - strong positions in terms of number of subscribers and market share across multiple business segments;

    - opportunity to become a leading enterprise business through the integration of the respective entity’s
expertise and rich product portfolio powered by the Virgin Media Group’s fiber-rich fixed-line network
and the O2 Group’s leading mobile network;

    - strong network infrastructure with a market-leading high-speed broadband network and a mobile
network with substantial spectrum holding; and

    - significant expected efficiencies by achieving key cost, capital expenditure and revenue synergies,
which in sum are expected to deliver substantial synergies valued at an estimated £6.2 billion on a net
present value basis after integration costs;

       - synergy benefits are estimated to include cost, capital expenditure and revenue synergy benefits of
£540 million on an annual basis by the fifth full year following completion of the Joint Venture
Transactions, comprised of approximately £350 million of cost savings, approximately
£80 million of capital expenditure synergies and approximately £110 million of revenue
synergies;

       - the key expected sources of cost and capital expenditure synergies include:

          - use of existing infrastructure to provide services for each of the Virgin Media Group’s and
the O2 Group’s customers at lower costs compared with each of the Virgin Media Group’s
and the O2 Group’s standalone and/or wholesale capabilities;

          - migration of Virgin Media’s existing mobile traffic to the O2 Group’s mobile network;

          - combination of regional and national network infrastructures and IT systems;

          - reduction in combined marketing expenditures;

          - potential to reduce general and administration costs; and

          - site rationalization;

       - the key expected sources of revenue synergies are expected to include significant growth through
cross-selling opportunities and scale; and

       - to achieve these synergies, the Joint Venture expects to incur approximately £700 million of
integration costs, substantially all of which are expected to be incurred in the first four years
following completion of the Joint Venture Transactions.

The Joint Venture intends to distribute available cash to its shareholders periodically and is expected to
undertake periodic further recapitalizations, subject to market and operating conditions (including compliance by
the Group with the terms of existing financing arrangements), to maintain a target net leverage ratio between
4.0x to 5.0x.

**_Sustainability Strategy of the Joint Venture_**

The O2 Group’s operations in the U.K. previously fell under Telefónica’s sustainability program and certain
of the Virgin Media Group’s sustainability strategies are designed to support the sustainability targets of Liberty
Global. Following consummation of the Joint Venture on the JV Closing Date, the Joint Venture will review its
existing programs and establish a single sustainability program for the newly combined operations.

**Virgin Media Group Overview**

The Virgin Media Group provides video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in the U.K.
over its broadband communications network and mobile services as a mobile virtual network operator
(“MVNO”). The Virgin Media Group has built out 2.4 million homes in the U.K. since 2015 and its network
covers 52% of the U.K. by homes passed as of March 31, 2021. The Virgin Media Group offers a variety of
broadband services over its cable network, including video, high speed broadband internet and telephony. This
network enables the Virgin Media Group to provide premium digital video services, broadband internet services
and fixed-line telephony services. The key product offer for the Virgin Media Group is its bundled fixed-line
services coupled with mobile voice and mobile data packages, commonly referred to as Fixed-Mobile Converged
bundles.

The Virgin Media Group’s U.K. network passed approximately 15.4 million homes (of which 14.2 million
are passed with HFC and 1.2 million passed with FTTH) and had approximately 5.7 million fixed-line customer
relationships as of March 31, 2021, compared to approximately 5.5 million as of March 31, 2020. In addition, the
Virgin Media Group had approximately 5.5 million broadband internet subscribers in the U.K. as of March 31,
2021, compared to 5.3 million as of March 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the Virgin Media Group had a fixedmobile convergence rate of 26.1% in the U.K., compared to 22.7% as of March 31, 2020, and a leading sector
average revenue per user in the U.K. among its peers.

The fixed-line market in the U.K. is expected to remain stable, with an estimated compound annual revenue
growth rate of 0.6% for 2020-2023 (source: Analysys Mason). FTTH build-out in the U.K. is below levels
observed in other markets, but is expected to accelerate rapidly in the next five years. FTTP and FTTB
technology is expected to increase from approximately 8% of internet connections in the U.K. in 2020 to
approximately 17% by 2023 (source: Analysys Mason).

The Virgin Media Group’s revenue and Segment Adjusted EBITDA was £5.1 billion and £2.1 billion,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and £1.3 billion and £507.3 million, respectively, for the

**_Sustainability Strategy of the Virgin Media Group_**

The Virgin Media Group’s sustainability strategy (the “Meaningful Connections Plan”) was launched in
February 2021. This sustainability strategy seeks to utilise the influence of the Virgin Media brand, the skills and
capabilities of its employees and the strength of its network to promote positive societal and environmental
changes. The Virgin Media Group’s sustainability plan will focus on the following three core undertakings for
the next five years (the terms “we,” “our,” and “us” below refer to the Virgin Media Group and its consolidated
subsidiaries):

    - **Better for people: We are aiming to build a business where all our employees and customers feel a**
sense of belonging and that they are being supported. To support this aim, we are creating initiatives
that assist individuals from underrepresented communities to develop skills and access employment
opportunities.

    - **Better for communities: While digital connectivity has increased incrementally, loneliness and**
isolation continue to rise with it. We are looking to bring people and communities closer together by
harnessing the power of our network and brand to help 1.5 million people foster meaningful
connections within their communities by the end of 2025, and intend to focus on supporting unpaid
carers with their experiences of loneliness through a five year partnership with Carers UK. We consider
a connection as “meaningful” where it helps reduce loneliness and build a sense of community
belonging. We will also look to encourage local volunteering as a way of encouraging community
involvement.

    - **Better for the planet: In recognition of the growing effects of human industry on our planet, we are**
looking to shrink our own impact by committing to a zero waste and zero carbon future. We have set a
goal of reaching net zero carbon and zero waste across our operations by the end of 2025.

The Virgin Media Group’s plan is underpinned by:

    - **Better business: We are committed to running our business responsibly by looking beyond our**
proactive environmental and social impact programs and looking to foster positive social and
environmental changes in our quotidian business operations.

_Virgin Media Group”._

**_Sustainability Strategy of the O2 Group_**

The O2 Group has a sustainability strategy (the “Blueprint Strategy”). The Blueprint Strategy was
launched in August 2020 and includes long-term targets to reflect the O2 Group’s commitment to reduce its
impact on the environment, and deliver a greener network for customers, by promoting the enabling role of
mobile in delivering a more sustainable future. It sets out its responsibility to society by helping people enjoy a
safer and more positive relationship with technology, and by improving digital access and inclusion. The
Blueprint Strategy also reflects the O2 Group’s commitment to running its business responsibly for its customers,
its people and other key stakeholders, by championing diversity and inclusion, and by building an ethical culture
and maintaining strong community ties.

The Blueprint Strategy has three primary commitments:

    - **Building a greener future by becoming a net zero business by 2025 (with the goal that the O2**
Group’s value chain achieve net zero emissions by 2040) and offering mobile and digital innovation to
customers to make a low-carbon world a reality;

    - **Helping society thrive by promoting greener, more inclusive and resilient communities powered by**
smart technology; and

    - **Leading by example by championing a fair and ethical business from the inside as an inclusive**
employer and adopting ethical decision making as well as creating shared accountability.

To underline the O2 Group’s commitment to contributing to a more sustainable future, the O2 Group has set
itself two climate-action targets as part of its greener future strategic pillar:

    - To achieve net zero emissions for its own operations by 2025, and by 2040 for its external value
chains; and

    - To reduce its value chain emissions by 39% by 2025.

The Blueprint Strategy is aligned with, and contributes to, eight of the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals, which aim to tackle pressing global challenges such as climate change, injustice and
equality, namely:

1. Promoting the use of affordable, safe, sustainable and modern energy for all;

2. Supporting sustainable consumption and production models;

3. Taking urgent action to fight climate change and its impacts;

4. Boosting connectivity and fostering innovation;

5. Reducing inequality and championing inclusion;

6. Enabling communities to benefit from the development and use of smart technologies;

7. Achieving gender equality; and

8. Promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.

The Blueprint Strategy is also underpinned by a commitment to operating responsibly in everything the O2
Group does. The Blueprint Strategy’s core values of “Bold, Open and Trusted” (representing the O2 Group’s
bold attitude, openness to its customers and people and its strong emphasis on earning the trust of its people and
customers) and its business principles (which form the O2 Group’s ethical code) help guide behaviours at all
levels of the organisation.

For more information regarding the sustainability of the O2 Group, see “Sustainability of the O2 Group”.

**_Overview of the Structure of the Offering_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into (i) an accession agreement to the VM Credit Facility, in
substantially the form attached as Annex D to this offering memorandum, with the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Agent (the “Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement”), pursuant to which
the Issuer will make available to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the VM
Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued in the
offering and (ii) an accession agreement to the VM Credit Facility, in substantially the form attached as Annex E
to this offering memorandum, with the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Agent (the
“Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement” and together with the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement, the
“New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”), pursuant to which the Issuer will make available to the New VM
Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the VM Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes issued in the offering.

The Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other VM Credit Facility Lenders
and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to
other VM Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the
Finco Loans (including the New Finco Loans) granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee and
the holders of the Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be
provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender,
including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in the VM Credit Facility, the guarantees granted by the
VM Credit Facility Guarantors and the VM Credit Facility Collateral. See “Description of the VM Credit Facility
_and the Related Agreements”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of the Bank Group (as defined in the_
VM Credit Facility) under the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same way as the other VM
Credit Facility Lenders, with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis described in this
“Description of the Notes” and to receive principal and interest on the New Finco Loans, which it will in turn use
to make payments on the Notes. For a description of procedures under the Indenture and the New Finco Facility
Accession Agreements relating to the voting rights of holders of the relevant series of Notes with respect to
decisions under the VM Credit Facility, see “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—
_To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”._

Under the VM Credit Facility, to the extent the Bank Group is in compliance with certain financial
covenants, the borrowers under the VM Credit Facility, at their discretion and without the consent of the VM
Credit Facility Lenders, are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to additional VM
Credit Facility Loans (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) under the VM Credit Facility, which benefit from
the protections provided to all VM Credit Facility Lenders, including the representations and warranties,
covenants, guarantees and security provided thereunder. For a further description of the VM Credit Facility, see
“Description of the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements”. The VM Credit Facility is attached as
Annex A to this offering memorandum.

On the Issue Date, (i) the net proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Notes, together with the fees payable to
the Issuer (if any) from the New VM Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility $ Fee Letter, will be used
by the Issuer to fund a loan (the “Finco Loan $”) borrowed under an additional facility (the “Finco Facility $”)
established pursuant to the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement under the VM Credit Facility and (ii) the net
proceeds of the offering of the Sterling Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer (if any) from the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility £ Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund a loan (the
“Finco Loan £” and together with the Finco Loan $, the “New Finco Loans”) borrowed under an additional
facility (the “Finco Facility £” and together with the Finco Facility $, the “New Finco Facilities”) established
pursuant to the Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement under the VM Credit Facility, and the Issuer will become a
VM Credit Facility Lender.

The principal amount of the Dollar Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and
currency, among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan $ and the
principal amount of the Sterling Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan £.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Collateral Sharing Agreement that governs the relative
rights of creditors under the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and any Additional Debt of the Issuer that


5


-----

benefits from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, all
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be shared on a pari passu basis by the holders of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) and the creditors of all Additional Debt of the Issuer that benefits from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis, including the Existing JV Notes. The Collateral Sharing Agreement sets
out, among other things, (i) the relevant ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, (ii) the consent level of the senior
creditors required to cast votes and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions and remedies under
the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the other debt instruments or agreements sharing in
the Collateral (including the Existing JV Notes), when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the
Collateral by the Security Trustee and (iii) turnover provisions. The holders and/or lenders, as applicable, of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and all Additional Debt
then outstanding will control any enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral.

**_Joint Venture Transactions_**

The transactions described under this “—Joint Venture Transactions” are referred to, collectively, herein as
the “Joint Venture Transactions”.

_Overview_

On May 7, 2020, Liberty Global, Liberty Global Europe 2 Limited (“Liberty Global Europe”), Liberty
Global Holdco Limited, Telefónica and Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (“Telefonica O2”) entered into a
contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to the terms of which the parties agreed to
form the Joint Venture. The Contribution Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, covenants
and indemnification obligations of Liberty Global and Telefónica relating to each of their contributed businesses.

As part of the Joint Venture, on June 1, 2021, Liberty Global and Telefónica (among other parties) entered
into a shareholders agreement (the “Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement”) whereby each of Liberty Global
and Telefónica directly or indirectly hold 50% of the issued share capital of VMED O2 UK Limited (the “JV
**Holdco”) and to which Liberty Global Europe contributed the operations of the Virgin Media Group (other than**
the VM Excluded Business) (the “Virgin Media Contribution”) and Telefonica O2 contributed the O2 Group
(the “O2 Contribution” and, together with the Virgin Media Contribution, the “Contributions”). The
Contributions were consummated on June 1, 2021 (the “JV Closing Date”). Each of Liberty Global Europe and
Telefonica O2 implemented certain reorganization steps prior to the JV Closing Date. In particular, the VM
Excluded Business were not part of the Virgin Media Contribution and were transferred out of the Virgin Media
Group prior to the JV Closing Date. See “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements of
_JV Holdco”. The Virgin Media Contribution included all existing third-party indebtedness of the Virgin Media_
Group and the O2 Contribution included all existing third-party indebtedness of the O2 Group, in each case as of
the JV Closing Date.

Each of Liberty Global and Telefónica guarantee the performance of Liberty Global Europe and Telefonica
O2, respectively, under each of the Contribution Agreement and the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement.

The Joint Venture Transactions are not expected to constitute a Change of Control under (and as defined in)
the Existing VM Notes, the VM Credit Facility or any other existing indebtedness of the Virgin Media Group or
the O2 Group.

_Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement_

The Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement provides that the initial board of directors of the Joint Venture
will be composed of eight directors, with four directors designated by each of Liberty Global Europe and
Telefonica O2. The Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement provided that, in general, most decisions of the board
of directors will require the approval of at least one individual designated by both Liberty Global Europe and
Telefonica O2, whereas certain decisions as to “Reserved Matters” will require the approval of both Liberty
Global Europe and Telefonica O2, either directly or through their designees to the board of directors. Such
“Reserved Matters” under the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement include: (i) changes in the constituent
documents of the JV Holdco, capital stock, certain executive management matters, or branding of the Joint
Venture; (ii) certain material transactions, including transfers of all shares in the JV Holdco and acquisitions and
dispositions over a certain threshold; (iii) the adoption of any new business plan or amendment to any current

-----

business plan (including with respect to the budget) of the Joint Venture; and (iv) certain other material business,
investing and financing decisions of the Joint Venture.

The Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement provides that the Chairman of the board of directors will
alternate every two years between a Liberty Global Europe director and a Telefonica O2 director. The initial
Chairman of the board of directors of the Joint Venture, Mr. Mike Fries, the CEO of Liberty Global, was
designated by Liberty Global Europe. Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete López, the CEO of Telefónica, was
designated as a director by Telefonica O2. The remaining directors and executive officers have been selected and
appointed by Liberty Global Europe and Telefonica O2 in accordance with the Joint Venture Shareholders
Agreement. See “Management and Governance of the Joint Venture”.

Pursuant to the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement, the Joint Venture will be required to make regular
cash distributions to the shareholders of the JV Holdco on a pro rata basis equal to the unrestricted cash of the
Joint Venture (subject to the Joint Venture maintaining minimum cash levels and complying certain leverage
ratios and the terms of its financing arrangements).

The Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement includes a lock-in period of three years from the date of the
agreement, during which the shareholders of the JV Holdco are not permitted to transfer their shares other than in
limited circumstances. Each shareholder of the JV Holdco has a customary right of first offer rights and dragalong rights, which shall apply following the fifth anniversary of the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement and
will be subject to non-compete and non-solicit undertakings subject to certain carve-outs.

_Intra-Group Services_

Following the JV Closing Date, the Joint Venture Parents have agreed to provide ongoing services to the
Joint Venture, primarily consisting of technology and innovation-related services, procurement, brand
management and other support services. The annual charges by the Joint Venture Parents for these services will
ultimately depend on the actual level of services required by the Joint Venture. In addition, the JV Holdco has
entered into a brand license agreement in respect of the use of the Joint Venture of the “O2” and “Telefónica”
brands.

_Joint Venture Financing Transactions_

As part of the Joint Venture Transactions, the Issuer issued the Existing JV Notes and, on the JV Closing
Date, the proceeds from the issuance of the Existing JV Notes were used by the Issuer to fund the Existing Finco
Loans pursuant to the applicable Existing Finco Facilities. See “Description of the VM Credit Facility and the
_Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility” and “Description of Other Debt—Existing JV Notes”._

Concurrently with the issuance of the Existing JV Notes, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower established
(i) a £1,500 million aggregate principal amount pound sterling-denominated term loan A as an Additional
Facility under (and as defined in) the VM Credit Facility (“Facility P”) and (ii) a €750 million aggregate
principal amount euro-denominated term loan B as an Additional Facility under (and as defined in) the VM
Credit Facility (“Facility R”). In addition, concurrently with the issuance of the Existing JV Notes, Virgin Media
Bristol LLC established a $1,300 million aggregate principal amount U.S. dollar-denominated term loan B as an
Additional Facility under (and as defined in) the VM Credit Facility (“Facility Q” and together with Facility P
and Facility R, the “JV Financing VM Credit Facilities”). See “Description of the VM Credit Facility and the
_Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility”._

The gross proceeds from borrowings under the Existing Finco Facilities and the JV Financing VM Credit
Facilities were used on the JV Closing Date to finance the Joint Venture Transactions including, but not limited
to, the financing of equalization payments required in connection with the Joint Venture Transactions, to pay fees
and expenses in connection with the Joint Venture Transactions and otherwise for general corporate and/or
working capital purposes of the Joint Venture.

The foregoing transactions are referred to, collectively, herein as the “JV Financing Transactions”.

-----

**_VM Revolving Credit Facility Transactions_**

Concurrently with the offering of the Notes, certain of the VM Credit Facility Obligors expect to enter into a
commitment letter with certain financial institutions, including certain lenders under the VM Credit Facility,
pursuant to which the aggregate principal amount of commitments available for borrowing under the VM
Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) shall be increased to an amount up to £1,500 million (the “VM
**Revolving Credit Facility Transactions”). There can be no assurance that the VM Revolving Credit Facility**
Transactions will be consummated on the terms described above or at all.

**Other Transactions**

The Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new credit
facilities, access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management
transactions, including vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured
credit facilities, from time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after, the Issue Date (the
“Potential Financing Transactions”). The cash proceeds, if any, of any Potential Financing Transactions may
be used for the redemption, refinancing, repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness of any member of the
Group, the payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith or the other transactions related thereto,
and/or distributions or other payments to direct or indirect parent companies. The indebtedness under any such
Potential Financing Transactions by the Group would be incurred in compliance with the applicable covenants
under the VM Credit Facility, the indentures governing the Existing VM Notes and the Existing VM Financing
Facilities. After giving effect to any such incurrence in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in
connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or other exceptions to the restriction on
our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized
pro forma EBITDA, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA
or the ratio of SHA total net debt to SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA could increase above the ratio of as adjusted
total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA, the ratio of as adjusted total
covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA or the ratio of SHA total net debt to SHA pro
forma LTM EBITDA presented under “Certain Pro Forma As Adjusted Covenant and Other Information”,
respectively, as of March 31, 2021, and such increases could be material. Any Potential Financing Transaction
will be made at the JV Holdco’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and, if any indebtedness
incurred thereunder is in the form of securities, such securities may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the
terms described in, a separate offering memorandum or liability management documentation. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial Matters—We may incur additional_
_indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which indebtedness could increase_
_our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other_
_existing indebtedness”._

Receivables Intermediary Financing Limited (which is outside of the Bank Group) (the “VM Intermediary
**Purchaser”)** are party to a trade receivables securitization transaction (the “VM **Receivables**
**Securitization”) pursuant to which Virgin Media Trade Receivables Financing Plc (the “VM Receivables**

issue one or more series of notes to fund the purchase (by way of assignment), through one or more steps
from the VM Intermediary Purchaser, of certain trade receivables originating from the VM Receivables
Securitization Originators. The VM Receivables Securitization creates a variable interest in respect of the
VM Receivables Securitization Issuer for which the Group is the primary beneficiary. As such, the JV
Holdco is required to consolidate the VM Receivables Securitization Issuer in its consolidated financial
statements. As of March 31, 2021, the VM Receivables Securitization Issuer has issued senior secured
variable funding notes with an aggregate principal amount of £225.0 million.

(a) Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are the primary measures used by the Virgin Media Group’s chief
operating decision maker and management to evaluate the operating performance of its businesses. Segment
Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are also key factors that are used by the Virgin Media Group’s internal
decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of its
management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As the Virgin Media Group
uses the term, “Segment Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings (loss) before net income tax benefit
(expense), other non-operating income or expenses, net gains (losses) on modification and extinguishment
of debt, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to changes in fair value of certain debt, net foreign
currency gains (losses), net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net interest
expense, net interest income, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and
provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items.
Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party
costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal,
advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and
losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. As the Virgin Media Group uses the term, “OFCF” is
defined as Segment Adjusted EBITDA less property and equipment additions. The Virgin Media Group’s
internal decision makers believe Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF are meaningful measures because
they represent a transparent view of the Virgin Media Group’s recurring operating performance that is
unaffected by its capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends and
(2) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the U.K. and Ireland. The Virgin Media Group
believes its Segment Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF measures, which are non-U.S. GAAP measures, are
useful to investors because they are each a basis for comparing the Virgin Media Group’s performance with
the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although the Virgin Media Group’s
measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Segment
Adjusted EBITDA and OFCF should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement
to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of income. Reconciliations of Segment Adjusted EBITDA
and OFCF to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are as follows:

(1) Following the introduction of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (“IFRS 15”), the O2
Group no longer reports “Mobile service revenue”, because it no longer believes that “Mobile service
revenue” is an accurate measure of its revenue, as that metric is disproportionately impacted by the
existence of its “O2 Refresh” proposition contracts and ongoing channel strategy. In addition, the O2 Group
believes that the presentation of “Mobile service revenue” is not in line with its competitors in the industry.
(2) OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDA-CapEx Margin are the primary measures used by the
O2 Group to evaluate the operating performance of its businesses, make decisions about allocating resources
and to establish operating and strategic targets. As the O2 Group uses the term, OIBDA is calculated by

excluding depreciation and amortization from operating profit. OIBDA Margin is OIBDA calculated as a
percentage of revenue. OIBDA-CapEx is calculated as OIBDA minus capital expenditures. OIBDA-CapEx
Margin is OIBDA-CapEx calculated as a percentage of revenue. Such measures are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS. The O2 Group believes such measures are useful to investors as they
provide one basis for comparing the O2 Group’s performance with the performance of other companies in
the same or similar industries, although such measures as defined by the O2 Group may not be directly
comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies. Such measures should be viewed as
measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating profit, net
cash inflow from operating activities and other IFRS measures of income or cash flows. The following table
provides a reconciliation of OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDA-CapEx Margin to the O2
Group’s operating profit for the referenced periods.

(a) CapEx includes acquisitions of right of use assets (Group and third parties) amounting to £316 million, of which £290 million
relate to the entry into the new Master Services Agreement with CTIL, and £23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively, £105 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and £142 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.
(b) CapEx includes £448 million of spectrum acquisition for the three months ended March 31, 2021, £84 million of spectrum
acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2020 and £524 million of spectrum acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2018.
See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures”.

(3) Prepaid percentage is calculated by dividing the number of prepaid mobile accesses at period end by the
total number of mobile accesses at period end.
(4) Contract percentage is calculated by dividing the number of contract mobile accesses at period end by the
total number of mobile accesses at period end.
(5) Since March 2020, IoT accesses have been reported separately within Mobile accesses and are no longer
reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 and the comparative period for 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect this new
reporting. IoT accesses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in total Contract
accesses.

(1) Borrowings are entirely with related parties within the O2 Group or parties affiliated with Telefónica.
(2) Net debt is a primary measure used by the O2 Group to evaluate the operating performance of its businesses,
make decisions about allocating resources and to establish operating and strategic targets. As the O2 Group
uses the term, net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Such
measure is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. The O2 Group believes such measure is
useful to investors as it provides one basis for comparing the O2 Group’s performance with the performance
of other companies in the same or similar industries, although such measure as defined by the O2 Group
may not be directly comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies. Such measure
should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for,
operating profit, net cash inflow from operating activities and other IFRS measures of income or cash flows.

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF JV HOLDCO**

The accompanying unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial statements of JV Holdco reflect the
pro forma effects of the agreement between Liberty Global plc (“Liberty Global”) and Telefónica S.A.
(“Telefónica”) to form a 50:50 joint venture (the “Joint Venture”), including the contribution by (i) Liberty
Global of Virgin Media Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (“Virgin Media”) operations in the U.K. (the “Virgin Media
**Contributed Entities”) and (ii) Telefónica of its mobile operations in the U.K., which comprise O2 Holdings**
Limited (“O2 Holdings”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “O2 Group”) (collectively, the
“Joint Venture Transactions”).

Upon formation, the Joint Venture recognized the assets and liabilities of the contributed businesses at their
then fair values, resulting in a new basis of accounting. The accompanying unaudited condensed pro forma
combined statement of financial position as of March 31, 2021 gives effect to the Joint Venture Transactions as if
such transactions had occurred on such date. The accompanying unaudited condensed pro forma combined
statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020
give effect to the Joint Venture Transactions as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020. No pro
forma effect has been given for the JV Financing Transactions, the VM Revolving Credit Facility Transactions,
the offering of the Notes or, in each case, the use of proceeds therefrom, each as described and defined elsewhere
in this offering memorandum. These unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(“IFRS”).

Pursuant to a shareholders agreement (the “Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement”) entered into upon
formation of the Joint Venture, Liberty Global and Telefónica will charge fees for certain services that each
entity will provide to the Joint Venture. These unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial statements
give effect to the estimated amounts expected to be charged to the Joint Venture pursuant to the Joint Venture
Shareholders Agreement.

The unaudited condensed pro forma combined results presented herein do not purport to be indicative of the
financial position and results of operations that the Joint Venture will obtain in the future, or that the Joint
Venture would have obtained were these transactions effective as of the dates indicated above. The pro forma
adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that the Joint Venture
believes are reasonable, but may differ from actual amounts. The Joint Venture has not yet completed its
valuations of the underlying fair values of its combined assets and liabilities. Such valuations can result in
material changes to the underlying historical assets and liabilities and have a material effect on the results of
operations attributable to changes to depreciation and amortization.

The “Virgin Media Group” comprises (i) Virgin Media and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Liberty Global and (ii) UPC Broadband Ireland Ltd and its subsidiaries (“VM Ireland”), which is another
wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global that provides communications services in Ireland. These unaudited
condensed pro forma combined financial statements have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction
with, (i) the Virgin Media Group’s audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “VM Annual Combined Financial Statements”),
(ii) the Virgin Media Group’s unaudited condensed combined financial statements as of March 31, 2021 and for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (the “VM Interim Condensed Combined Financial
**Statements”), (iii) O2 Holdings’ audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended**
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (iv) O2
Holdings’ unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2021 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (the “O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”), each
incorporated by reference or included elsewhere herein. The VM Annual Combined Financial Statements and the
VM Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and, due to the fact that VM Ireland was a “restricted
subsidiary” under the provisions of the facilities agreement and bond indentures governing the debt of the Virgin
Media Group during the applicable periods, such financial statements were prepared on a combined basis. The
O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

(a) Includes the assumed effective equity settlement of certain related-party notes receivable and related-party
debt.

(b) Adjustments primarily relate to (1) differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS associated with the
accounting treatment for (i) asset retirement obligations, (ii) leases and (iii) income taxes and
(2) presentational and classification differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

(2) Represents the historical financial information of the O2 Group, as presented in the O2 Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements and the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as adjusted
to reflect the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents and related-party debt and for certain presentational changes.
In this regard, the O2 Group’s historical (i) cash and cash equivalents of £468.2 million and (ii) related-party debt
of £1,411.6 million have each been excluded, as these amounts were not contributed to the Joint Venture under
the terms of the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement. In addition, the O2 Group’s historical revenue has been
adjusted by £2.5 million and £10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, to align the presentation of income arising in the course of ordinary activities.

(3) Represents estimated adjustments to fair value associated with the application of the new basis of

(a) Represents the estimated enterprise value as of March 31, 2021 of the contributed businesses.

(b) For purposes of these unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial statements, the carrying value of
the contributed third-party debt is assumed to approximate its fair value.

(c) Represents the estimated fair value of the contributed derivative assets and liabilities.

(d) Represents the application of the new basis of accounting to current and long-term contract assets and
liabilities.

(e) Represents the estimated impact of the preliminary fair value adjustments presented herein on the Joint
Venture’s deferred taxes. These income tax impacts have been computed based on a U.K. statutory tax rate
of 19.0%. The pro forma balance of the JV Holdco’s deferred taxes as of March 31, 2021 was a deferred tax
liability of $13.3 million, which amount is included in other non-current liabilities on the JV Holdco’s pro
forma combined statement of financial position.

The final estimation of fair value of contributed assets and liabilities will be based upon appraisals and may
differ from the preliminary fair values reflected herein. Finalization of the valuation process will likely lead
to changes in property, plant and equipment, net, customer relationships, spectrum licenses, contract assets
and liabilities, goodwill, debt liabilities and deferred income taxes. To the extent that additional value is
allocated to assets with finite lives, the final measurement of assets and liabilities could result in additional
depreciation and/or amortization expense that in turn would result in lower operating income and earnings
from continuing operations. For example, a £100.0 million increase in the value allocated to intangible
assets with an average remaining estimated useful life of ten years would result in additional annual
amortization expense of £10.0 million.

(4) Represents application of the new basis of accounting to contract liabilities, and associated revenue
and cost of services, of the Virgin Media Contributed Entities and the O2 Group upon formation of the Joint
Venture.

(5) Represents the elimination of historical intercompany transactions between the Virgin Media
Contributed Entities and the O2 Group for the periods indicated. These transactions largely relate to mobile
roaming and interconnect activity.

-----

(6) Amounts represent adjustments to decrease cost of services associated with deferred commissions as a
result of the application of the new basis of accounting to contract assets.

(7) Represents (i) the elimination of the (a) historical related-party fees and allocations charged by Liberty
Global to the Virgin Media Group for services that generally relate to management, finance, legal, technology
and other services that support the Virgin Media Group’s operations (£77.6 million and £300.7 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively) and (b) historical fees
charged by Telefónica to the O2 Group (£10.0 million and £40.0 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively) and (ii) estimated amounts to be charged by Liberty
Global and Telefónica to the Joint Venture pursuant to the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement associated with
the ongoing services expected to be provided to the Joint Venture, primarily consisting of technology and
innovation-related services, procurement, brand management and other support services (£33.0 million and
£134.0 million charged by Liberty Global for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, and £10.0 million and £40.0 million charged by Telefónica for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively).

(8) Represents (i) adjustments to increase amortization expense of £360.1 million and £1,440.4 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, which amounts reflect
the difference between (a) the amortization expense associated with the Joint Venture’s customer relationships
intangible asset resulting from the application of the new basis of accounting and (b) the historical amortization
expense associated with the customer relationships intangible asset of the Virgin Media Contributed Entities of
£19.4 million and £77.6 million, respectively, and (ii) net decreased amortization expense of £1.6 million and
£6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively,
associated with the net increase to the O2 Group’s spectrum licenses intangible asset as a result of the application
of the new basis of accounting. The amortization is computed on a straight-line basis using a weighted average
estimated useful life of 6.0 years for customer relationships and estimated useful lives ranging from 0.8 years to
17.1 years for spectrum licenses. An increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value allocated to the customer
relationships intangible assets of £100.0 million would result in higher (lower) annual amortization expense of
£16.7 million. An increase in the estimated useful life used to amortize the acquisition accounting adjustment to
customer relationships intangible assets of one year would result in lower annual amortization expense of
£216.9 million, while a decrease of one year would result in higher annual amortization expense of
£303.6 million.

(9) Represents the estimated income tax impacts associated with the pro forma adjustments presented
herein. These income tax impacts have been computed based on a U.K. statutory tax rate of 19.0%.

(1) The pro forma as adjusted covenant and other information presented in the table, which is unaudited,
represents the combination of the Virgin Media Contributed Entities and the O2 Group as of and for the
three and twelve months ended March 31, 2021, prepared in accordance with IFRS. As further described
under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, the financial information of the Virgin Media
Group is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the financial information of the O2 Group is prepared
in accordance with IFRS. The pro forma as adjusted covenant and other information is based upon the
preliminary assessment of the IFRS presentation of the Virgin Media Group. Although we do not expect that
material differences impacting the pro forma as adjusted covenant and other information will be identified
based on further assessments, no assurance can be given that this will be the case. See “Risk factors—Risks
_Relating to the Joint Venture Transactions—Virgin Media prepares its financial statements in accordance_
_with U.S. GAAP and the O2 Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Following_
_the Joint Venture Transactions, the Joint Venture will prepare its financial statements in accordance with_
_IFRS. There may be significant differences between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP presentations of the historical_
_financial information of Virgin Media”._
(2) Annualized pro forma EBITDA is calculated by multiplying “EBITDA” (as defined in the VM Credit
Facility) of the JV Holdco for the six months ended March 31, 2021 (£1,896.6 million equivalent) by two.
The definition of “EBITDA” differs from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” and “EBITDA” under
the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement, certain of the indentures governing the Existing VM Notes and
the Existing VM Financing Facilities. See “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial
_Statements of JV Holdco”._
(3) As adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA includes a £175.0 million increase to reflect 50% of the
expected full-year cost synergies that are estimated to be achieved upon the completion of the integration of


28


-----

the Virgin Media Contributed Entities and the O2 Group by the fifth full year following completion of the
Joint Venture Transactions. These full-year cost synergies exclude expected revenue and capital expenditure
synergies. See “Summary—Joint Venture Overview”.
(4) As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt are calculated in
accordance with “Senior Net Debt” and “Total Net Debt” (each as defined in the VM Credit Facility) and
are adjusted to reflect the JV Financing Transactions, the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the
application of the proceeds thereof. As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant
net debt presented here differ from the calculation of “Indebtedness” under the “Consolidated Leverage
Ratio” and “Leverage Ratio”, as applicable, under certain of the indentures governing the Existing
VM Notes and the Existing VM Financing Facilities and from “Total Net Debt” under the Joint Venture
Shareholders Agreement. Vendor financing obligations are not included in the calculations of as adjusted
total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt. If these obligations were included in
our leverage ratio calculation, and the Credit Facility Excluded Amounts (as defined in the VM Credit
Facility) excluded, the ratio of as adjusted total net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma EBITDA would
be 4.29x. The amounts shown, which, if applicable, take into account currency swaps but do not include
premiums or discounts, differ from the debt figures that are presented under “Capitalization of JV Holdco
_and the Issuer—JV Holdco”. After giving effect to any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a_
Potential Financing Transaction in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in connection with
permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to
incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized pro
forma EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized pro forma
EBITDA could increase above the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted
annualized pro forma EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized
pro forma EBITDA presented above, as of March 31, 2021, and such increases could be material. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial Matters—We may incur_
_additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which indebtedness_
_could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes_
_and our other existing indebtedness”._
(5) SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA is the “EBITDA” (as defined in the Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement)
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, which excludes certain non-recurring costs such as costs to
capture. Costs to capture generally include incremental, third-party operating and capital related costs that
are directly associated with integration activities, restructuring activities, and certain other costs associated
with aligning an acquiree to our business processes to derive synergies. SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was £3,776.8 million. The definition of “EBITDA” differs
from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” and “EBITDA” under certain of the indentures governing
the Existing VM Notes, the VM Credit Facility and the Existing VM Financing Facilities.
(6) SHA total net debt is calculated in accordance with “Total Net Debt” (as defined in the Joint Venture
Shareholders Agreement) and is adjusted to reflect the JV Financing Transactions, the issuance of the Notes
offered hereby and the application of the proceeds thereof. Total debt presented here differs from the
calculation of “Total Net Debt” under the VM Credit Facility and “Indebtedness” under the “Consolidated
Leverage Ratio” and “Leverage Ratio”, as applicable, under certain of the indentures governing the Existing
VM Notes and the Existing VM Financing Facilities. The amounts shown, which, if applicable, take into
account currency swaps but do not include premiums or discounts, differ from the debt figures that are
presented under “Capitalization of JV Holdco and the Issuer—JV Holdco”. After giving effect to any
incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a Potential Financing Transaction in compliance with the
applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or
other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of SHA total net debt to
SHA pro forma LTM EBITDA could increase above the ratio of SHA total net debt to SHA pro forma LTM
EBITDA presented above, as of March 31, 2021, and such increase could be material. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial Matters—We may incur additional_
_indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which indebtedness could_
_increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and_
_our other existing indebtedness”._

-----

**Limited Recourse Restrictions . . . . . . .** Except under the limited circumstances specified under “Description
_of the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”, the obligations of the_
Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents
and the Collateral Sharing Agreement will be solely to make
payments of amounts in aggregate equivalent to the amounts actually
received by or for the account of the Issuer from the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower and/or VMIH under the VM Credit Facility and the
Related Agreements. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent
upon payments from the New VM Credit Facility Borrower, which
payments will be guaranteed by the VM Credit Facility Guarantors,
under each of the New Finco Loans, other than certain amounts due
on the Notes (such as prepayment premiums and additional amounts,
if any) which will be financed by the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower and/or VMIH pursuant to the relevant Related Agreement,
in order to service its obligations under the Notes.

In addition, other than under the limited circumstances described
under “Description of the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”,
holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or
assets of the Group (other than the Issuer) and none of the JV Holdco
or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) have any obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to
make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and the VM
Credit Facility Guarantors to make payments to the Issuer under the
VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements, as applicable.

No member of the Group will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under
the Notes.

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On and from the Issue Date, the holders of the Notes will benefit
directly from security interests granted to the Security Trustee on
behalf of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the
following rights, property and assets (the “Collateral”):

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Finco Loans
(including all rights of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender
under the VM Credit Facility and the New Finco Facility
Accession Agreements);

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Deeds of
Covenant;

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Fee Letters;

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Expenses
Agreement (excluding any transaction fees payable to the Issuer
pursuant thereto and the Issuer’s rights to be indemnified in
respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts payable to
parties that do not benefit from the security interests in the
Collateral);

                         - all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Issue Date
Amounts Loans; and

                         - sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the
Issuer (excluding any transaction fees payable pursuant to the
Expenses Agreement).

See “Description of the Notes—Notes Collateral”.

-----

The Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same
as all other VM Credit Facility Lenders and will have benefits, rights
and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and
protections afforded to other VM Credit Facility Lenders. Through
the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the
Finco Loans (including the New Finco Loans) granted to secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be
provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to
the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender, including the indirect
benefit of the covenants contained in the VM Credit Facility and the
guarantees and security granted for the benefit of the VM Credit
Facility Lenders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_the Structure—The security interest in the VM Credit Facility_
_Collateral securing the New Finco Loans will not be granted directly_
_to the holders of the Notes” for more information._

The Collateral Sharing Agreement provides that the security interests in
the Collateral may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the
amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default under (and
as defined in) the Indenture, subject to and in accordance with the terms
of the Collateral Sharing Agreement. Neither the Trustee nor the
holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Notes Security
Documents. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only take
action to enforce the Notes Security Documents through the Security
Trustee and the Collateral Sharing Agreement. In addition, pursuant to
the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the ability of the Security Trustee to
enforce the security interests in the Collateral will be restricted and will
be at the discretion of the relevant creditors. See “Description of the
_Collateral Sharing Agreement” for more information._

**VM Credit Facility Guarantors . . . . . .** On the date of this offering memorandum, the VM Credit Facility
Guarantors are the only guarantors of the obligations of the Obligors
(as defined in the VM Credit Facility) under the VM Credit Facility
(subject to certain specified guarantee limitations, including, but not
limited to, the exclusion of liability to the extent that such guarantee
would constitute unlawful financial assistance under applicable law).

In addition, the VM Credit Facility requires that additional members
of the Bank Group become guarantors under the VM Credit Facility,
(a) in the event that they become Material Subsidiaries (as defined in
the VM Credit Facility), or (b) where necessary in order to ensure that
the aggregate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of the Obligors (on an unconsolidated basis and
excluding intra-group items) equal or exceed, respectively, 80% of
the consolidated EBITDA (excluding for the purposes of this
calculation any EBITDA attributable to any Joint Venture (as defined
in the VM Credit Facility)) of the Bank Group (the “VM Credit
**Facility 80% Security Test”). As of March 31, 2021, after giving**
effect to the Transactions, the VM Credit Facility Guarantors
represented more than 90% of the pro forma combined total assets of
the Group as of March 31, 2021, and more than 90% of the pro forma
combined revenue of the Group for the three months ended March 31,
2021. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
_Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the VM Credit_
_Facility_ _Guarantees_ _may_ _adversely_ _affect_ _their_ _validity_ _and_
_enforceability”._

-----

**VM Credit Facility Collateral . . . . . . .** Each of the New Finco Loans will be secured by the security interests
on all of the assets of the Bank Group that are granted to the VM
Credit Facility Security Trustee to secure the VM Credit Facility. The
VM Credit Facility is, or will be, primarily secured by all or
substantially all assets of the Bank Group; provided that, on or after
the Asset Security Release Date (as defined in the VM Credit
Facility), the security granted to secure the VM Credit Facility will be
limited to (i) share pledges over all of the capital stock of the
Borrowers and the other Obligors under (and each as defined in) the
VM Credit Facility and (ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors
in relation to certain intercompany loans. For a description of the VM
Credit Facility Collateral, see “Description of the VM Credit Facility
_and the Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility—Guarantees and_
_Security”._

**Mandatory Redemption on a Change**
**in Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Following a Change of Control (as defined in the VM Credit
Facility), the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will be required, at
the election of the Instructing Group under (and as defined in) the
VM Credit Facility, to prepay the New Finco Loans at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the applicable New Finco Loan.
Following any such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes
at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of
redemption. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Redemption_ _and_
_Repurchase—Redemption upon a Change of Control”._

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event that all or any portion of any New Finco Loan is
voluntarily prepaid by the New VM Credit Facility Borrower
pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the VM Credit
Facility (an “Early **Redemption** **Event”),** subject to and in
accordance with the terms of the VM Credit Facility and the
applicable New Finco Facility Accession Agreement, the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements will provide for the payment of
certain additional payments to be made to the Issuer that correspond
to the premiums payable to holders of the applicable Notes upon early
redemption, as described below.

At any time prior to July 15, 2026, with respect to the Finco Loan $,
and at any time prior to July 15, 2026, with respect to the Finco Loan
£, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event in respect of
the applicable New Finco Loan, the Issuer will redeem (i) an
aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes equal to the principal
amount of the Finco Loan $ prepaid in such Early Redemption Event
(not to exceed an amount equal to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including Additional Dollar
Notes, if any)) and/or (ii) an aggregate principal amount of the
Sterling Notes equal to the principal amount of the Finco Loan £
prepaid in such Early Redemption Event (not to exceed an amount
equal to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
Sterling Notes (including Additional Sterling Notes, if any)) in each
case, during each twelve month period commencing on the Issue
Date, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of
the applicable Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
(but excluding) the date of redemption. See “Description of the
_Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Optional Redemption”._

-----

At any time prior to July 15, 2026, with respect to the Finco Loan $,
and at any time prior to July 15, 2026, with respect to the Finco Loan
£, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event in respect of
the applicable New Finco Loan with the net cash proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) (the
“Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Issuer will
redeem (i) up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes (including Additional Dollar Notes, if any) equal to
the principal amount of the Finco Loan $ prepaid with any Equity
Offering Early Redemption Proceeds and/or (ii) up to 40% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes (including

The above description is intended to summarize certain material

Finco Facility Accession Agreements (in the form attached as
Annexes D and E to this offering memorandum) in their entirety
before investing in the Notes.

The VM Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective
upon the approval by lenders constituting the “Instructing Group” (as
currently defined in the VM Credit Facility, without giving effect to
the VM Credit Facility Amendments). However, certain of the VM
Credit Facility Amendments, including those related to extending the
date of any payment and releasing guarantors and collateral, will
become effective only upon the approval of all VM Credit Facility
Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from VM Credit Facility
Lenders under the VM Credit Facility and the other creditors under
certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group
Intercreditor Deed and the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed
will cease to govern the VM Credit Facility and the Existing VM
Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor
Agreement will establish the relative rights of the VM Credit Facility
Lenders, the holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and
certain creditors under other financing arrangements of the Group.

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other VM Credit
Facility Lenders. In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility
Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)
(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to
any matter arising from time to time under the VM Credit Facility or
under the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, as applicable, in
which all VM Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or
required to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will solicit votes
(or other consents) from holders of Notes and any other applicable
series of Additional Debt (including the Existing JV Notes) with
respect to such VM Credit Facility Decision (as defined in
“Description of the Notes”) in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture. However, the Issuer will, under (and effective as of the
date of) each of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, on
behalf of holders of the applicable Notes, provide its consent as a VM
Credit Facility Lender to any and all of the VM Credit Facility
Amendments. The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder Consent
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding in
respect of any of the VM Credit Facility Amendments for the
purposes of the provisions of the Indenture described under
“Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To
_the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession_
_Agreements”. As a result, the Issuer will not solicit votes (or other_
consents) from the holders of the Notes with respect to the VM Credit
Facility Amendments.

In addition, the Issuer will not be entitled to receive, and will
expressly waive under the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements,
any right it may have to any consent, waiver, amendment or other
similar fee that may be paid to other VM Credit Facility Lenders in
connection with their approval of the VM Credit Facility
Amendments (although the Issuer will generally be required to be
paid the same consent fees paid to other VM Credit Facility Lenders
with respect to other amendments). See “Description of the Notes—
_New Finco Facility Accession Agreements and the VM Credit_
_Facility” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Payments for Consent” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Notes and Structure—By investing in the Notes you will have_
_provided advance consent to the VM Credit Facility Amendments_

_which will automatically become effective without any further consent_
_from holders of the Notes upon VMIH obtaining the consent of either_
_the Instructing Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) or, with_
_respect to certain amendments, all VM Credit Facility Lenders”._

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State
of New York.

The VM Credit Facility, the New Finco Facility Accession
Agreements, the Related Agreements, the Intercreditor Deeds, the
Collateral Sharing Agreement and the Notes Security Documents are
or will be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may only be
offered or sold by you pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of, or in transactions not subject to, the U.S. Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
market. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so, and may discontinue market-making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to the Authority for admission of the Notes
to the Official List of The International Stock Exchange.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes,
together with amounts received under the New Finco Facility Fee
Letters, will be used by the Issuer to fund the New Finco Loans to the
New VM Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the VM Credit
Facility. The gross proceeds of the New Finco Loans will be used,
together with existing cash and cash equivalents, to repay
£1,124 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under Facility
P under the VM Credit Facility.

In accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework, the Joint
Venture intends to use an amount equal to the net proceeds of the
Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible
Green Projects and to pay fees and expenses in relation thereto.
Accordingly, on June 14, 2021, Sustainalytics, a provider of
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) research and analysis,
evaluated the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework and certified that it
aligns with the 2021 Green Bond Principles and provided views on
the robustness and credibility of the VMED O2 Green Bond

Framework (which views are intended to inform investors in general,
and not for a specific investor). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not be a suitable_
_investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—
_Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount_
_equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance_
_and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or_
_to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

**Certain Tax Considerations . . . . . . . . .** One or more series of the Notes may be treated as having been issued
with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An
obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original
issue discount if its stated redemption price at maturity exceeds its
issue price by at least a de minimis amount. If a Note is treated as
issued with original issue discount, U.S. investors will be subject to
tax on that original issue discount as it accrues, in advance of the
receipt of cash payments attributable to that income (and in addition
to stated interest). You are urged to consult your own tax advisors
with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax
considerations related to purchasing, owning and disposing of the
Notes. For a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax
and certain U.K. tax considerations, see “Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations” and “Certain Material United Kingdom_
_Tax Considerations”._

**Certain ERISA Considerations . . . . . .** The Notes and/or any interest therein may, subject to certain
restrictions, be sold and transferred to ERISA Plans (as defined
herein). See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. Please see “Risk
_Factors” in this offering memorandum for a description of certain_
risks that you should carefully consider before investing in the Notes.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the_
_specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference_
_into, this offering memorandum. If any of the risks described below, individually or in combination, were to_
_occur, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows_
_and financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes, the VM_
_Credit Facility Obligors’ ability to pay all or part of the interest, principal or other amounts on the New Finco_
_Loans and, in turn, the Issuer’s ability to pay all or part of the interest, principal or other amounts on the Notes._

_Although the risk factors described below and elsewhere in this document are the risks considered to be the_
_most material, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or_
_other factors that could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business_
_or operations in the future. In addition, the past financial performance of the Virgin Media Group and the O2_
_Group may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to_
_anticipate results or trends in future periods. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem_
_immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business**

**_We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively_**
**_compete with other service providers._**

The markets for broadband internet, cable television, fixed-line telephony, mobile and value-add services in
which we operate are highly competitive and, in certain markets, we compete with established companies that
hold positions of market power in these and/or closely related markets. We face competition from these
companies, other established companies and potential new entrants. Technological advances may increase
competition or alter the competitive dynamics of markets in which we operate. For example, we face increasing
competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, the incumbent telecommunications
operators and other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet and mobile
connectivity increases, we also face competition from over-the-top (“OTT”) voice and video call services (such
as Skype, Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts and Zoom) and video service
providers utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections. In the provision of telephony and
broadband internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the incumbent telecommunications
operators and other service providers in the U.K., as well as providers of mobile voice and data. In addition,
continued consolidation within the media industry may permit more competitors to offer “triple-play” bundles of
digital television, fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services, or “quad-play” bundles including mobile
telephony services. Developments in the DSL, as well as investments into FTTx technology by the incumbent
telecommunications operator and alternative providers, in particular the deployment of full fiber networks, have
improved the attractiveness of our competitors’ products and services and strengthened their competitive
position. Developments in and extensive deployment of wireless technologies, such as 5G and fixed wireless
access, are creating additional competitive challenges.

In order to compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge for our services (for
example, due to aggressive pricing from our SIM only (“SIMO”) competitors) or increase the value of our
services (for example, by offering increased data with handset bundles) without being able to recoup associated
costs. We may also need to pursue legal and regulatory actions. In addition, some of our competitors offer
services that we are unable to offer. We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from
both existing competitors and the influx of new market entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory
framework of the industries in which we operate, as well as strategic alliances and cooperative relationships

among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of
customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price and promotional competition in
our markets. Additionally, we may see intensified competition in bidding processes for new and existing projects
or customers, and potential losses of business, public sector customers or distributors to other market
participants. In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive pressures could have a
material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our ability to meet growing customer demand for mobile services and to expand our business depends, in part,_**
**_on the capacity, speed and reliability of our mobile network which in turn depends on our ability to adequately_**
**_manage network capacity and usage levels, successfully implement capacity expansion and yield management_**
**_strategies, and acquire additional spectrum._**

We currently one of two operators with the least amount of spectrum of any mobile network operator
(“MNO”) in the U.K. alongside Three. Recent technological advances and changes in customer behavior and
demands, including the increasing prevalence of smartphones and tablets and the use of data-intensive
applications on such devices (such as streaming of high-definition video and making video calls), have resulted
in substantial growth in mobile data volumes. Total mobile data volumes in the U.K. have grown sharply in
recent years, increasing to 4,271 petabytes in 2020 from 533 petabytes in 2014, a compound annual growth rate
of 41.5% (source: Analysys Mason). We currently experience periods where localized sections of our network
become capacity constrained, particularly during peak usage times. While these existing localized capacity
constraints are managed as part of our ordinary business operations, if mobile data volumes continue to grow at
current rates, and we are unable to secure additional network capacity, our mobile network may become severely
capacity constrained in the short- to medium-term. Such severe capacity constraints would create speed and
reliability issues on our mobile network and could cause significant service issues for our customers. Such
service issues would likely result in customer dissatisfaction and could potentially lead to increased customer
deactivation rates (also referred to as customer churn rates) and damage to our reputation. This could, in turn,
have a material adverse impact on our business strategy and brand, and may result in us losing market share and/
or being unable to grow our business.

Although we may be able to grow our mobile network capacity and thereby alleviate some or all of these
capacity constraints by acquiring additional spectrum, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire
additional spectrum on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, while Ofcom may hold additional
spectrum auctions in the future, no assurance can be given that such additional spectrum auctions will not also be
delayed (whether due to legal challenges or otherwise at the discretion of Ofcom), or that they will be held at all.
Although we intend to bid for additional spectrum if and when the auctions occur, we may be unsuccessful in
acquiring spectrum at a commercially acceptable price, or at all, in particular given the number of other potential
bidders for spectrum, some of which may have substantially greater financial resources than us. In the event we
are unable to acquire spectrum as part of any future auction, we may be unable to acquire additional spectrum by
means of a commercial agreement with another spectrum license holder. Such spectrum trading is rare in the
U.K., any such agreement would be subject to Ofcom’s consent and holders may be unwilling to sell spectrum to
competitors for various strategic and commercial reasons.

We seek to manage capacity constraints and/or network speed and reliability on an ongoing basis through a
variety of yield management techniques. However, there can be no assurance that such strategies and techniques
will be effective, particularly in dense urban city areas where capacity constraints can be more acute. Any failure
to obtain adequate spectrum and to successfully implement any capacity expansion and/or any yield management
strategies in a timely manner or in a manner sufficient to address our network capacity constraints could have a
range of adverse effects on our business. In particular, it could result in a deterioration of customer experience
with our mobile network which would result in increased customer dissatisfaction and therefore increased
customer churn rates, greater costs associated with attracting and retaining customers and potentially significant
damage to our brand and reputation. We may also be unable to meet our service obligations under our existing
arrangements with mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”) or enter into new MVNO arrangements. Any
one or all of these outcomes may also adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our business or may even
result in negative business growth, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Potential changes to the award of mobile Crown Commercial Services contracts could result in a loss of_**
**_revenue._**

The Cabinet Office of the U.K. Government, through Crown Commercial Services (“CCS”), has undertaken
a project examining the feasibility of creating a new Public Sector Mobile Service to replace the

56


-----

existing framework agreements under Lot 6 of the Network Services Framework through which the O2 Group
provides public sector services (for additional information, see “Business of the O2 Group—Products and
_Services—Public Sector”). CCS has estimated the total value of this award being approximately £2 billion, based_
on a four-year contract and up to a two-year extension. U.K. MNOs and MVNOs were invited to participate in
the discussions. Whilst CCS evaluates its longer-term options it indicated in April 2021 that it intends to procure
an interim replacement for Lot 6 of the Network Services Framework by May 2022, based on a 3-year contract,
with one year extension valued at £650 million. The O2 Group is engaging with CCS to prepare a bid for one of
up to six places on the new framework. Tender documents are expected during the last two quarters of 2021. The
O2 Group currently derives significant revenues from its services under the current Network Services Framework
and any potential changes to the award of mobile services contracts by CCS, or the failure to secure a position on
future frameworks, could result in a loss of revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, cash
flows and results of operation and financial condition.

**_Changes in technology, and our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, may limit the_**
**_competitiveness of and demand for our services._**

Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including
advances in current technologies and the emergence of new technologies. New technologies, products and
services may impact consumer or business customer behavior and therefore demand for our products and
services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new
and enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our
revenue and number of subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not
meet consumer expectations or demand, can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as
intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and services that we may offer, or the development of
significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. While we continue to work with various commercial and
academic organizations on technological innovation and strategic areas of improvements, including the
deployment of 5G to expand our capacity and capability, there is no assurance that such partnerships will
continue in the future.

Customers have an ever-increasing demand for our services and products. In order to continually deliver
excellent customer experiences across our network and products, it is key that our systems keep pace with
demand and service expectations. We will have to make significant investment in our transmission and core
network to support future growth. A failure in our network capacity may result in, among other things, a partial
or total failure of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G coverage and associated costs, reputational damage, and potential breach of
MVNO contracts relating to use of our network. As a result, we must also continue to increase and improve the
functionality, availability, and characteristics of our network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity
latency and coverage to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed, lower latency
telephony, data and internet services as the telecommunications industry is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid,
significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the
emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make
current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to
finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a positive return.

**_A failure to adequately manage our legacy technologies and transformation could result in a loss of existing_**
**_customers, a failure to attract new customers and an increased likelihood of data security incidents._**

We must adequately manage our legacy technologies, systems and platforms (including, servers and
software) which have reached, or are approaching, the “end of life” stage of their life cycle and which, therefore,
will no longer be supported. Capital expenditure will be required to ensure sufficient security is maintained in
respect of legacy products and to ensure a smooth transition to supported replacements. A failure to adequately
support legacy systems and to properly procure their replacement may result in a negative impact on the
provision of services to customers, resulting in a loss of existing customers and making it more difficult to attract
new customers, as well as an increased likelihood of data security incidents.

**_Our significant property, plant and equipment additions, namely in connection with our Network Extension_**
**_and deployment of our 5G network, may not generate a positive return._**

Significant additions to our property, plant and equipment are, or in the future may be, required to add
customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade
customer premises equipment (“CPE”) to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience.

57


-----

Additions to our property, plant and equipment, which are currently underway, including in connection with our
Network Extension and deployment of our 5G network, require significant capital expenditures for equipment
and associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related CPE. In particular, we
have incurred, and will in the future incur, significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies,
such as our 5G network, related to the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures for
our mobile operations. New technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth
requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make
additional investments to increase their infrastructure capacity. Additionally, significant competition, the
introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL
technologies, the impact of natural disasters or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to
undertake previously unplanned builds or upgrades of our networks and CPE.

No assurance can be given that any rebuilds, upgrades or extensions of our network (including the Network
Extension and deployment of our 5G network) will increase penetration rates, increase cable or mobile revenues,
or otherwise generate positive returns as anticipated, or that we will have adequate capital available to finance
such rebuilds, upgrades or extensions. Additionally, costs related to our Network Extension, the deployment of
our 5G network and property, plant and equipment additions could end up being greater than originally
anticipated or planned. For example, the decision of the U.K. Government to require the removal of all Huawei
equipment from 5G networks by 2027 may result in the incurrence of costs that were not originally contemplated
in connection with our 5G network roll-out and may increase our reliance on certain other suppliers for the
deployment of our 5G network. If our costs are greater than originally anticipated, we may require additional
financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our deployment,
development and expansion plans or otherwise forgo market opportunities. Additional financing may not be
available on favorable terms, if at all, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our debt
agreements. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding,
extending or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property, plant
and equipment, or are delayed in making such investments, our growth could be limited and our competitive
position could be harmed.

**_Adverse economic developments could reduce customer spending for our cable television, broadband internet,_**
**_fixed-line telephony and mobile services and increase churn._**

Most of our revenue is derived from customers (from consumer to enterprise and multinational companies)
who could be impacted by adverse economic developments globally, in Europe and the U.K. The U.K. officially
entered an economic recession in August 2020 and ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues,
among other things, has contributed to a challenging economic environment. The economic environment has
been further challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Accordingly, unfavorable economic conditions may
impact a significant number of our customers and, as a result, it may be (i) more difficult for us to attract new
customers, (ii) more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their handsets, tariffs and/or services,
(iii) less likely that customers will upgrade their handsets, tariffs and/or services and (iv) more difficult for us to
maintain revenues at existing levels. The U.K. may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal
deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our results of operations. Accordingly, our ability to increase,
or, in certain cases, maintain, our revenue, margins and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the
economic environment in Europe or the U.K. remains uncertain or declines (including as a result of the U.K.’s
departure from the EU). We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.
For a description of the risks associated with the U.K.’s departure from the EU, see “—The U.K.’s departure
_from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or_
_liquidity” below. For a description of the risks associated with COVID-19, see “—The effects of the COVID-19_
_outbreak could adversely impact our business and results of operations” below._

**_Our fixed-line telephony revenue is declining and unlikely to improve._**

Business and residential fixed-line telephony usage is declining across the industry. There is a risk that
business and residential customers will migrate from using fixed-line telephony to using other forms of
telephony, such as VoIP, or mobile. There is no assurance that our fixed-line telephony customers will migrate to
our mobile phones and they may eventually shift to other providers of mobile telephony services. Such a
migration could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, revenue and financial condition.

**_A failure in our network and information systems, whether caused by a natural failure or a security breach,_**
**_could significantly disrupt our operations._**

Certain network and information systems are critical to our business activities. Network and information
systems may be affected by cyber-security incidents that can result from deliberate attacks or system failures. These
may include, but are not limited to computer hackings, computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other destructive
or disruptive software, or other malicious activities against our systems as well as third-party sites, which could
affect the security of our customers’ accounts. Cyber-security breaches, internal security breaches, physical security
breaches or other unauthorized or accidental access to our servers, other information systems or databases could
result in tampering with, or the theft or publication of, sensitive business information or personal consumer
information or the deletion or modification of records, or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations. Our
network and information systems may also be the subject of power outages, fire, natural disasters, terrorist attacks,
war or other similar events. Theft of metals is particularly acute in the U.K. due to high prices for scrap metal, and
our network is not immune to such thefts. Such events could result in a degradation of, or disruption to, our cable
and non-cable services, and could prevent us from billing and collecting revenue due to us or could damage our
equipment and data or could result in damage to our reputation. Disruption to services could result in excessive call
volumes to call centers that may not be able to cope with such volume, which could in turn have a material adverse
effect on our reputation and brand. Our plans for recovery from, and resilience to, such challenges may not be
sufficient. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be
sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may
result. To date, other than the non-permitted access of one of our databases, we have not been subject to
cyberattacks or network disruptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or
financial condition. Although we have not detected another material security breach or cybersecurity incident to
date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. For
more information, see note 17 to the VM Annual Combined Financial Statements included in the VM 2020 Annual
Report incorporated by reference herein. See also “—A failure to comply with data protection laws may result in
_significant fines and reputational damages”._

Sustained or repeated failures of our own or third-party systems that interrupt our ability to provide services
to our customers, prevent us from billing and collecting revenue, or that otherwise prevent us from meeting our
obligations in a timely manner, could materially adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers
and revenue. These network- and information systems-related events could also require significant expenditures
to repair or replace damaged networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future
and/or the payment of compensation or other goodwill payments to affected customers. For example, in 2018, the
O2 Group experienced a significant network outage for approximately 24 hours. The network outage arose as a
result of an inherent fault with new technology supplied by a third-party vendor which affected the O2 Group’s
mobile network and resulted in the O2 Group offering and making goodwill payments to affected customers.
While the O2 Group has since implemented processes and procedures in an effort to prevent the occurrence of
similar outages, there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar network outages in the future.
Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, penetration by viruses, worms or other
destructive or disruptive software, leakage, falsification or the accidental release or loss of information
maintained in our information technology systems and networks or those of our business partners (including
customer, personnel and vendor data) could damage our reputation, result in legal and/or regulatory action
against us, and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.
As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the
potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the
protection, privacy and security of personal information, the liability associated with information-related risks is
increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. The
occurrence of any such network or information system-related events or security breaches could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_A failure to comply with data protection laws may result in significant fines and reputational damages._**

We process a substantial amount of customer data as part of our day-to-day business. In the event of a data
breach (of any kind) which impacts personal data, we have notification obligations to the Information
Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”), impacted data subjects, and in some cases under our commercial contracts. The
ICO has the power to fine companies up to 4% of global group turnover in respect of a data breach where the
company is found to be at fault and any impacted data subject can levy claims for compensation (which can be
aggregated into a “class style” litigation). In addition, we may be liable under certain of our commercial contracts
in the event of certain data breaches. In February 2020, the Virgin Media Group became aware that one of its

59


-----

databases did not have adequate access security protection and was accessed without permission. In addition, in
2019 the O2 Group became aware that certain customer records were stored on a secure device of a partner of the
O2 Group that was discovered missing. In the event of any large-scale data breach, we may incur significant time
and expense in investigating and remedying any such breach. Furthermore, the reputational impacts of a data
breach, especially in an industry where customer trust is paramount and the processing of customer data is
essential, are likely to be extensive and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations. See “—Risks Relating to Regulatory and Legislative Matters—We are subject to significant
_regulation, and changes in U.K. and EU laws, regulations, governmental policy affecting the conduct of our_
_business, or other risks relating to claims, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to set prices, enter_
_new markets or control our costs”._

**_Unauthorized access to our network resulting in piracy could result in a loss of revenue._**

We rely on the integrity of our technology to ensure that our services are provided only to identifiable
paying customers. Increasingly sophisticated means of illicit piracy of television, broadband internet and
telephony services are continually being developed in response to evolving technologies. Furthermore, billing
and revenue generation for our pay television services rely on the proper functioning of our encryption systems.
While we continue to invest in measures to manage unauthorized access to our networks, any such unauthorized
access to our cable television service could result in a loss of revenue, and any failure to respond to security
breaches could raise concerns under our agreements with content providers, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services_**
**_required for our businesses._**

We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide
services to our customers, and maintain significant outsourcing partnerships in connection with our customer
services and management obligations. We are also heavily reliant on both certain handset suppliers to provide
in-demand models to be offered in conjunction with our mobile services, and certain suppliers in relation to
maintenance of our network and services and the provision of parts. Our suppliers often conduct business
worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic
instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism, labor issues and pandemics
(including the COVID-19 pandemic). While it is not currently possible to estimate the duration and severity of
the COVID-19 pandemic or the adverse economic impact resulting from the preventative measures taken to
contain or mitigate its outbreak, an extended period of global economic disruption could have a material adverse
impact on the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us. As a result, we may not
be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in CPE could lead to delays in completing extensions to our networks and in
connecting customers to our services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase
our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they
experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially
adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers or our ability
to maintain our relationships with distributors and MVNOs. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness
of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could
disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows.

We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our
operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our licensed
intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into
licensing arrangements with licensors on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of
the intellectual property rights in question.

Failure of our suppliers to comply with our social and environmental guidelines may result in harm to our
reputation and brands, which may have a negative impact on our business, sustainability rating and financial
position. If we experience a need to replace an existing supplier, including due to their non-compliance with our
social and environmental guidelines, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be
available when required on terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on
acceptable terms, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would take to
train such suppliers in our methods, products, quality control standards, labor, health and safety standards, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We face risks associated with the activities of device manufacturers, including disintermediation and_**
**_commoditization risks, and risks relating to our ability to secure adequate and timely supply of handsets that_**
**_experience high demand._**

The importance of device manufacturers in the handset market gives rise to disintermediation and
commoditization risks. Our business is dependent on our customer relationships. Therefore, any strategies or
technologies that enable such device manufacturers, particularly those with significant market presence, to
leverage their existing brand awareness to dominate customer relationships, or which otherwise compete with our
offerings, could undermine the effectiveness of our customer-focused strategies. In particular, the development of
technologies that enable device manufacturers to offer handsets with embedded, reprogrammable subscriber
identity modules (“SIMs”) (often referred to as “e-SIMs”) or no physical SIM card at all (referred to as “soft
**SIMs”), such that those handsets are compatible with, and therefore can be used on, any network, presents a risk**
to our current business strategy. Soft SIMs or e-SIMs would enable customers to select a mobile service
provider, or switch mobile service providers, directly via their handset without the need to directly engage with
an MNO or MVNO. The availability of such soft SIMs or e-SIMs, combined with competitive handset financing
terms offered by certain device manufacturers, may lead customers to view their core relationship as being with
the device manufacturer rather than with their mobile service provider and may undermine our investment in our
customer relationships and our ability to acquire new, and retain existing, customers. There is no assurance that
customer preferences may not shift such that they purchase handsets directly through device manufacturers rather
than from us, as a result of which our opportunity to cross-sell additional services and products in adjacent
markets will also be significantly limited.

Our results of operations and financial condition have also been and are expected to continue to be
influenced by the availability and perceived attractiveness of new handsets, and particularly new generations of
smartphones. Accordingly, our success depends in part on the ability to secure timely access to, and sufficient
supplies of, handsets and other products that experience high demand. While we have entered into agreements for
the supply of such products with device manufacturers and other suppliers, in certain cases the relevant supplier
is under no obligation to supply us with a specific or minimum number of devices. On the contrary, we are under
an obligation to order certain minimum agreed volumes under some of our contracts, and a failure to make such
minimum orders may result in contractual penalties being imposed. This discrepancy between the supplier’s
obligations and the minimum order quantity obligation on us results in uncertainty regarding the volume or
timing of supply. In addition, if our competitors were able to secure access to, and begin selling, handsets ahead
of us, or if device manufacturers or other suppliers were to provide preferential treatment to, or were to enter into
exclusive agreements with, one or more of our competitors, then we may be unable to secure an adequate supply
of handsets on a timely basis to meet customer demand, which may result in decreased revenue, a loss of market
share, reputational damage and a loss of customer loyalty.

In addition, several factors may result in decreased demand for new handsets, including any decrease in the
actual or perceived attractiveness and levels of innovation in new generations of handsets or their operating
systems, an increase in sustainability concerns among customers, including a heightened awareness of the
environmental impact of routine handset consumption, or a slowing of new release cycles. This may reduce our
ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers as well as to cross-sell other products and
services, as customers become less eager to enter into new contracts with us as a means of financing their
purchases of new handsets. Under such circumstances, customers may also seek out competitively priced
SIM-only contracts, which may result in decreased revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our mobile services rely on the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our_**
**_mobile communications traffic._**

Our services to mobile customers rely on the use of network sharing and network extension arrangements in
which we utilize the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our mobile
communications traffic, including our network sharing arrangement with Vodafone which has enabled the
roll-out of 5G through site sharing, and the partnership between the U.K. Government, Ofcom and other MNOs
which helps to deliver increased coverage for remote areas (the “Shared Rural Network”). If any of our
network sharing or network extension arrangements are terminated, or if the respective third-party wireless
network provider fails to provide the services required under a network sharing or network extension
arrangement, or if the respective third-party wireless network provider fails to deploy and maintain its network,
and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely and commercially reasonable basis or at
all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such network sharing or network

extension arrangement. In turn, this could potentially affect our ability to support the MVNOs relying on our
network to offer their own services to customers. Additionally, as our network sharing and network extension
arrangements come to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement arrangements on the same
or more favorable terms.

**_Our failure to maintain and further develop our direct and indirect distribution channels may affect our_**
**_ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers._**

We acquire new customers, and upgrade existing customers, both via direct distribution channels (i.e. our
shops, franchised shops, our website and mobile app and telesales) and indirect distribution channels (i.e. thirdparty retailers, as well as business partners, distributors, wholesale partnerships and MVNOs). There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain, grow or invest in our direct distribution channels. For
example, we may be unable to maintain a competitive online presence, enter into new shop leases or renew
existing shop leases on favorable terms, or at all. Similarly, we may be unable to find suitable replacement
premises if leases of any of our existing premises are terminated prior to their stated expiration date. In addition,
there can be no assurance that our current or future franchisees will continue to partner with us on favorable
terms, or at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will recover any costs associated with
investments in our direct distribution channels or that investing in maintaining or expanding our distribution
channels will result in an increase in our revenues. In addition, investments required to implement new guidance
and/or restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce the amount of resources available to
us to fund other investments in our distribution channels. Any failure to maintain, grow or invest in our direct
distribution channels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial
condition.

We rely heavily on indirect distribution as a means of reaching to a broader range of customers and as a
supplement to our direct distribution channels. Our consumer trading arrangement with Dixons Carphone (a
leading independent specialist mobile retailer in the U.K.), previously one of our major partners, expired in April
2020 and was not renewed. There is no assurance that our existing arrangements with direct distribution partners
will continue beyond their terms. Indirect distributors may sell mobile contracts on behalf of a number of
different MNOs, offering similar packages to those sold by the MNOs through their own direct distribution
channels. As a result, indirect distributors may be viewed by some consumers as a price comparison hub for
different tariff plans between MNOs and as offering more independent advice regarding the relative merits of
such plans. This positioning of indirect distributors may give such distributors a degree of bargaining power in
the negotiation of agreements with MNOs (including their agreements with us) and their commission fee. There
is no assurance that the indirect distributors will not enter into preferential agreements with our competitors or
decline to continue to enter into agreements with us, either on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Our failure to maintain key indirect distribution relationships or expand our direct and indirect distribution
presence (both through physical stores and online), or any failure by indirect distribution partners to procure new
customers, could result in our being unable to retain or grow our market share and increase the costs of acquiring
and retaining customers. Conversely, if indirect distribution partner growth is not appropriately directed, there is
a risk of “substitution”, where customers switch from the O2 Group’s direct channels to the channel provided by
an indirect partner, thereby adversely impacting profitability. Any, or a combination, of the foregoing could have
a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The “Virgin” and “O2” brands are not owned by us and the activities of the Virgin Group and the O2 Group_**
**_and other licensees of either brand (whether operating in the same industry or in other industries) could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards us as a licensee._**

The “Virgin” and “O2” brands are integral to our corporate identity. We do not own these brands and use
them under licenses from third parties. We are also reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards such
brands.

The “Virgin” brand licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances.
For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the license, after providing us with an opportunity to cure,
(i) if we or any of our affiliates commit persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the
licenses, (ii) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the
licensed trademarks by us has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the
“Virgin” brand or (iii) if a third party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person,” such
as a legally disqualified director or a bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global.

In addition, the O2 Group currently markets the vast majority of its products and services under the “O2”,
“O2 Refresh” and “Priority” brands and related rights (the “O2 Brand Rights”). However, the O2 Group does
not own the O2 Brand Rights, but rather has a right to use the O2 Brand Rights in the U.K. pursuant to the terms
of a license (the “O2 Trademark License”) between Telefonica UK Limited and O2 Worldwide Limited which
is for an indefinite term.

The Joint Venture has the right to use the O2 Brand Rights in the U.K. pursuant to the terms of a license (the
“O2 JV Trademark License”) entered into between O2 Worldwide Limited and the JV Holdco. The O2 JV
Trademark License, which entitles the Joint Venture to use the O2 Brand Rights and related intellectual property,
has been granted on a royalty-bearing basis, also for an indefinite term. The O2 Trademark License and the
O2 JV Trademark License may be terminated in certain circumstances, including material non-use for a period of
24 months or material breach.

If the Joint Venture was unable to continue to use the O2 Brand Rights or the “Virgin” brand due to a
termination of the O2 Trademark License, the O2 JV Trademark License and/or the brand license from Virgin
Enterprises Limited for any reason, significant time, effort and resources would be required to establish a new
brand identity which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Adverse publicity in relation to Virgin Group or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson who is
closely associated with the “Virgin” brand, or in relation to another licensee of the “Virgin” name and logo in
another industry (particularly in the U.K.) could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and
results of operations. The “O2” brand is also used in markets outside of the U.K. over which we will have no
control. The management of the O2 brand globally resides with O2 Worldwide Limited and not the O2 Group.
Any adverse publicity as a result of actions of licensees of the “O2” brand in such markets could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.

**_We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters_**
**_for programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable_**
**_terms could adversely affect our business._**

We enter into agreements for the provision of television programs and channels distributed via our
entertainment service (some of which are also offered as O2 Extras alongside a customer’s tariff) with program
providers, such as public and commercial broadcasters, or providers of pay or on-demand television and services.
We have historically obtained a significant amount of our premium programming and some of our basic
programming and pay-per-view sporting events from Sky. Sky is also one of our main competitors in the
television services business. Sky is a leading supplier of programming to pay television platforms in the U.K. and
is the exclusive supplier of some programming, including its Sky Sports channels and Sky Cinema channels,
which are the most popular premium subscription sports and film channels available in the U.K.

The Sky Sports channels, Sky Cinema channels and the BT Sport channels are available in our
entertainment service, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue carrying such channels
at a reasonable cost after the current contracts end.

Other significant programming and app suppliers include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, UKTV, Viacom Inc.
(including Five), Discovery Communications Inc., Disney, Sky, NBC, Universal, Turner (a division of Time
Warner Inc.), Netflix, Calm, Cafeyn, Melody VR, Oculus and Amazon. Our dependence on these and other
suppliers for television programming could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide attractive
programming at a reasonable cost. We also rely on the products of some of these suppliers of television
programming to incentivize customers to enter into contracts for our mobile services. Without their offering, the
number of customer subscriptions may be adversely affected. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and
renegotiating programming agreements and our annual costs for programming can vary. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming agreements on acceptable
terms or at all. There has also been a rise in the number of direct-to-consumer offerings from content owners
which impacts negotiations and the content, rights and restrictions available. Programming and copyright costs
represent a significant portion of our operating costs and are subject to increases in future periods due to various
factors, including (1) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights
associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, and
(2) rate increases.

63


-----

If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and
future video services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing
customers and/or migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting
our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain
of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports and movie
programming, and as certain players in the OTT market, for example Netflix, Amazon and Disney, increasingly
produce their own exclusive content and distribute direct to consumers.

**_The Virgin Media Group does not currently insure the underground portion of its cable network and various_**
**_pavement-based electronics associated with its cable network and it may not insure such assets in the future._**

Our cable network is one of our key assets. However, the Virgin Media Group does not currently insure the
underground portion of its cable network or various pavement-based electronics associated with its cable
network. Almost all of its cable network is constructed underground. As a result, in the event we do not insure
such assets in the future, any catastrophe that affects our underground cable network or our pavement-based
electronics could prevent us from providing services to our customers and result in substantial uninsured losses
that would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_The U.K.’s departure from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations or liquidity._**

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved, on an advisory basis, an exit from
the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020. On
December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU reached the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”, referred to as the
“EU-U.K. Agreement”. On December 30 2020, the EU-U.K. Agreement was approved by the U.K. Parliament,
with the EU Parliament ratifying the agreement on April 28, 2021. In the meantime, the EU-U.K. Agreement has
been provisionally brought into effect. The EU-U.K. Agreement focuses on four main sectors, namely trade,
economic and social cooperation, security and governance. For more information regarding the EU-U.K.
Agreement, see “Regulation of the O2 Group”. Examples of the potential impact Brexit could have on our
business, financial condition or results of operations include:

    - changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital markets. For example, a
sustained period of weakness in the British pound sterling or the euro could have an adverse impact on
our liquidity, including our ability to fund repurchases of our equity securities and other U.S. dollardenominated liquidity requirements;

    - reduction in data roaming revenues;

    - shortages of labor necessary to conduct our business, including our Network Extension;

    - disruption to our supply chain and related increased cost of supplies (both in relation to devices and
handsets, and network maintenance);

    - a weakened U.K. economy resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products and services;

    - legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which
EU laws and directives to replace or replicate, or where previously implemented by enactment of U.K.
laws or regulations, to retain, amend or repeal; and

    - various geopolitical forces may impact the global economy and our business, including, for example,
other EU member states proposing referendums to, or electing to, exit the EU.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic
for U.K. restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for U.K. office
holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will
apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state
and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In
particular in cases where the appointment of a U.K. office holder is made in reliance on a U.K. domestic
approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU
member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the U.K. was a
member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be
recognized and whether investors may adversely affected as a result.

**_We are exposed to the risks arising from widespread epidemic diseases in the countries in which we operate,_**
**_such as the outbreak of COVID-19, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. In response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, emergency measures have been imposed by governments worldwide, including travel
restrictions, restrictions on social activity and the shutdown of non-essential businesses. These measures have
adversely impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and
disruption of financial markets. While it is not currently possible to estimate full extent of the adverse economic
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or resulting from the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its
outbreak, an extended period of global economic disruption could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods, including with respect to, among other
items, (i) our ability to access capital necessary to fund property and equipment additions, debt service
requirements, acquisitions and other investment opportunities, the repurchase of equity securities or other
liquidity needs, (ii) the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services, (iii) our ability to maintain
or increase our residential and business subscriber levels, (iv) our ability to offer attractive programming,
particularly in consideration of the recent cancellation of numerous worldwide sporting events, and (v) the ability
of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us. We may also be adversely impacted by any
government-mandated regulations on our business that could be implemented in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, countries may seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits that result from
measures taken to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, such as by imposing new taxes on the
products and services we provide.

We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects on our operational and
financial performance, the extent of which will depend on certain developments, including the duration and
spread of the outbreak, the impact on the general economy, the impact on our customers and our sales cycles, the
impact on the credit risk profiles of our partners, the impact on our employees and the effect on our vendors, all
of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. If, among other factors, the adverse impacts stemming from the
COVID-19 outbreak, competition, economic, regulatory or other factors, including macro-economic and
demographic trends, were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could
conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of
goodwill or other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant. Additionally, our ability
to execute on cost-cutting measures and organizational change initiatives may impact our financial performance
and results of operations, including lower than anticipated cost savings. For instance, in the event demand for our
products or services is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic
impacts, we may need to assess different corporate actions, organizational change initiatives and cost-cutting
measures, including reducing our workforce, reducing our operating and capital costs or closing one or more of
our retail stores, offices or facilities, and these actions could cause us to incur costs and expose us to other risks
and inefficiencies. Additionally, in the event our business experiences a subsequent recovery, there can be no
assurance that we would be able to rehire our workforce or recommence operations at such facilities on
commercially advantageous terms, if at all.

**_Our business may be affected by perceived health risks associated with electromagnetic radiation from base_**
**_stations and associated equipment_**

Concerns have been expressed that electromagnetic signals emitted by base stations may pose health risks.
All operational base stations have been installed in compliance with criteria established by the International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the independent advisory body to the World Health
Organization, which include electromagnetic field exposure limits. During the first COVID-19 U.K. lockdown,
concerns that existed in a minority of the population about electromagnetic signals (particularly in relation to the
roll-out of 5G) resulted in approximately 30 masts belonging to MNOs in the U.K. being vandalized. While we
have worked with the Home Office of the U.K. Government to reduce the frequency of such cases of vandalism,
there is no guarantee that individuals who perceive network equipment to pose a health risk will not engage in
further activities which may disrupt service to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, and
consequently adversely affect our results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Regulatory and Legislative Matters**

**_We are subject to significant regulation, and changes in U.K. and E.U. laws, regulations, governmental policy_**
**_affecting the conduct of our business, or other risks relating to claims, may have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our ability to set prices, enter new markets or control our costs._**

Our principal business activities are regulated and supervised by the U.K. Office of Communications
(“Ofcom”), the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), the ICO and the Competition and Markets Authority
(“CMA”), among other regulators. Regulatory change is an ongoing process in the communications sector at
both the U.K. and E.U. level. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our activities and
those of our competitors could significantly influence how we operate our business and introduce new products
and services. For example, regulatory changes relating to our activities and those of our competitors, such as
changes relating to the form of our commercial propositions, third-party access to infrastructure, the costs of
interconnection with other networks, our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters,
the prices of competing products and services, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for
other operators, could adversely affect our ability to set prices, enter new markets or control our costs. In
particular, Ofcom may attempt to require us to make available access to our ducts or may attempt to impose
regulation on the cable network, which is currently unregulated. Ofcom may also attempt to impose regulation to
address any competition concerns in the future.

Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or
future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. In addition, our business and the
industry in which we operate are subject to investigation by regulators and claims brought by private parties,
which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties (including restrictions imposed on, or the removal
of, both licenses to offer regulated propositions and persons licensed under the Senior Managers & Certification
Regime) or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. For example, in the past, Ofcom has conducted
enforcement investigations into the O2 Group regarding the availability of its network and billing practices. Any
such action in the future could harm our reputation and result in increased costs to the business, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or our cash flows.

We are also subject to accreditation requirements with respect to certain of our B2B products and services
provided to public sector organizations in the U.K. We have security accreditations across a range of B2B
products and services for public sector organizations in the U.K., which are granted subject to periodic reviews of
our policies and procedures by U.K. governmental entities. If we were to fail to maintain an accreditation or to
obtain a new one when required, it could impact our ability to provide certain offerings to the public sector.

**_We are required to comply with payment card industry standards on data security._**

In addition to our regulatory obligations, in order to provide card payment services to our customers, we are
required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the “PCI-DSS”) implemented by
major card schemes, including Visa, Master Card, American Express, Discover and JCB. These standards are
designed to ensure merchants maintain systems and processes that protect payment card holder data. The O2
Group has gained and maintained relevant PCI DSS certification for the E-Commerce payment channel and is
due to undertake its annual re-certification for the Face-to-Face channel. The O2 Group has an agreed program of
activity covering the remaining payment channel and are proactively working towards certification.

Any failure to comply with PCI-DSS may result in fines and obligations to implement remediation measures
to ensure compliance. Any sustained failure to comply with PCI-DSS or to meet any remediation obligations
within the time frames imposed could result in our authority to take card payments being revoked. This would
mean that our customers would be unable to pay for purchases via card payment, resulting in significant
reputational damage, increased customer churn rates and reduced revenues, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic_**
**_sanctions programs._**

We are subject to various anti-corruption laws (including the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010), and
economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations and the EU. The anticorruption laws generally prohibit providing anything of value to government officials for the purposes of
obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. We may deal with entities the
employees of which are considered government officials. In addition, economic sanctions programs restrict our
business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, individuals and entities.

66


-----

Although we have internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations, including policies applicable to third parties with whom we deal as
franchisees and outsourced service providers, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be
sufficient or that our employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not take actions in
violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and
sanctions regulations) for which we or they may be ultimately held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption
laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties, exclusion from government contracts, damage to
our reputation and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows,
results of operations and financial condition. See “Business of the O2 Group—Legal Proceedings”.

**_Certain of our employees are represented by trade unions and we may be affected by strikes or collective_**
**_action by such unionized employees._**

A number of our employees within our general population and middle management levels are represented
by trade unions, being the Communications Workers Union and Prospect, respectively, and we are party to
voluntary collective agreements with those unions. We generally have a good relationship with the trade unions
that represent our employees and have not, to date, experienced any material issues or been involved in any
significant disputes with these unions or the employees they represent. However, there can be no assurance that
such issues or disputes will not arise in the future, including breakdowns in the bargaining process between us
and the trade unions concerned. Any such disagreement or dispute could result in our being unable to continue to
negotiate wages, salaries, bonuses and work time flexibility on terms that we consider to be acceptable and
appropriate, or could lead to strikes or other industrial action (or the threat of strikes or industrial action) which
could damage our brands and reputation and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business,
growth prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Regulatory and/or government action on climate change may drive medium-to-long-term increases in_**
**_operational cost_**

Due to the nature of our operations, we are subject to regulatory developments and government action on
climate change through energy-specific regulations and/or legislation in the U.K. Examples include circular
economy regulations for electrical products and packaging, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon
pricing, fuel mix, energy and fuel cost, and energy policy. Changes in regulations and/or legislation results in
changes in the market. Increased fuel or energy prices could make it more expensive to purchase energy to power
our networks and data centres. An increase in the tax on fuel could increase the cost associated with operating
our large vehicle fleet where those vehicles are dependent on traditional fuels. Implementation of a carbon
taxation policy could impact the Joint Venture by directly putting a price on our emissions, which would impact
our operational costs.

Regulators’ increased focus on environmental factors could also mean that our business becomes more
scrutinised and that any failure to comply with such new regulations and laws could result in financial sanctions
or fines. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and
administrative sanctions and liabilities, including substantial fines and orders, or a partial or total shutdown of
our operations, as well as litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Management, Principal Shareholders and Related Parties**

**_The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business._**

We have experienced employees at both the corporate and operational levels who possess substantial
knowledge of our business and operations. There can be no assurance that we will retain the services of these
employees or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or
delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business
operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

**_We may fail to attract or retain qualified, high-quality personnel._**

Given the substantial competition in the market for skilled and qualified personnel with relevant technical,
industry and operational experience, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain suitably
qualified, high-quality replacements on similar terms to those on which it currently engage our employees. We

67


-----

may also incur significant additional costs in recruiting and retaining suitable replacements. Any loss of
experienced personnel or a failure to recruit suitably qualified, high-quality personnel could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The interests of the Joint Venture Parents, the direct or indirect parent companies of the Joint Venture, may_**
**_conflict with our interests and those of the holders of the Notes._**

Liberty Global and Telefónica are our parent companies, directly or indirectly owning all of the voting
interests in us. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of the Joint Venture
Parents (or other entities controlled by the Joint Venture Parents) may be different from, or in conflict with, our
interests on a stand-alone basis or the interests of holders of the Notes. Because we are indirectly controlled by
the Joint Venture Parents, the Joint Venture Parents may allocate certain or all of their risks to us and there can
be no assurance that the Joint Venture Parents will permit us to pursue certain business opportunities.

**_The sustainability program of the Joint Venture’s operations may be viewed as inadequate with regard to our_**
**_environmental impacts by customers, regulators and government, leading to damage to our reputation and_**
**_brands._**

Based on the nature of our operations and electricity required to run our network, customers could perceive
the Virgin Media and O2 brands as detracting from a transition to a lower-carbon economy, particularly if we fail
to successfully demonstrate efforts to reduce our environmental impact. Our customers, employees, and other
stakeholders expect us to be environmentally responsible and take appropriate measures to minimize the impact
of our operations on the environment. While we have publicly committed to achieving emissions reduction, net
zero, waste and circularity targets, failure to achieve these targets or increasing expectations of a company’s
contribution to tackling the climate crisis may lead to damage of our brands and reputation that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business may not anticipate or adapt in a timely manner to changing customer demands and/or new_**
**_ethical or social standards, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation._**

To maintain and improve its position in the market in comparison to its competitors, it is vital that our
business has the ability to anticipate and adapt to the evolving needs and demands of its customers, and that it
avoids commercial actions that may generate a negative perception of the Joint Venture or the products and
services it offers, or that may have or be perceived to have a negative impact on society. In addition to harming
our business’ reputation, such actions could also result in fines and other sanctions. There is growing societal and
regulatory demand for companies to behave in a socially responsible manner. In addition, the risks associated
with potential damage to a brand’s reputation have become more relevant, especially due to the impact that the
publication of news through social networks can have. If our business is not able to anticipate or adapt to the
evolving needs and demands of its customers or avoid inappropriate actions, its reputation could be adversely
affected or it could otherwise have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows of the Joint Venture.

**_Climate change may drive medium-term to long-term increases in operational costs to address the impact of_**
**_changing climate and weather patterns, including changing levels of precipitation, mean temperatures and sea_**
**_level rise and/or the impact of regulation_**

Medium-to-long-term our operational costs may increase as a result of shifts in climate patterns, and the
threat of these issues may impact current and future business decisions related to our network, data centres and
facilities. It could also impact our operational costs through increased energy usage and spend to prepare or
repair facilities. Rising and extreme temperatures could cause our cooling infrastructure to run more frequently
and, in turn, present an additional burden to local power and water resources. Increased risk of flooding to
low-lying facilities and infrastructure due to longer-term increases in precipitation patterns could increase
operating costs to maintain and/or repair facilities and network equipment. Decreased precipitation could
generate drought conditions that could create an increased burden to local water resources, which are required to
operate our cooling infrastructure. These impacts could also result in drops in productivity or increased
operational costs for our suppliers that would be passed on to our Group, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

68


-----

**_Possible environmental, social and governance, regulatory or political changes could lead us to recognize_**
**_assets as impaired._**

The Joint Venture will review on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it, the
value of assets and cash-generating units, to assess whether their carrying values can be supported by the future
expected cash flows, including, in some cases, synergies in connection with acquisition costs. Potential changes
in our regulatory, business, economic or political environment, in particular in relation to ESG issues, may result
in the need for us to introduce changes in recognition of impairments in goodwill, intangible assets, property,
plant and equipment or financial assets.

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal
requirements relating to the protection of people and the environment. These laws and regulations are also
subject to constant review by lawmakers and regulators which may result in further, including more stringent,
environmental or health and safety legal requirements. This could lead to an asset depreciation or reduction in the
useful life of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness, Taxes and Other Financial Matters**

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which_**
**_indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of_**
**_the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of
our existing debt, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our
financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and may decide to enter into new
credit facilities, access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management
transactions, including vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured
credit facilities, from time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after the Issue Date. Any such
offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election or the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and if such
debt is in the form of securities, may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate
offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the
pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes
and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would
have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of
any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later
than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be
as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise
any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as
to the timing of such offering or incurrence, or the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new
debt in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as
described above and elsewhere in this offering memorandum could intensify.

**_Base Erosion and Profit Shifting._**

Further changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base
erosion and profit shifting project that has been undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (“OECD”) or the European Commission Anti-Tax Avoidance Package. The OECD, which
represents a coalition of member countries that encompass the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the
European Commission have undertaken studies and are publishing action plans that include recommendations
aimed at addressing what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by
companies. It is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to these initiatives or their own
concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us through increasing our tax liabilities.

**_We have substantial indebtedness that may have a material adverse effect on our available cash flow, our_**
**_ability to obtain additional financing if necessary in the future, our flexibility in reacting to competitive and_**
**_technological changes and our operations._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of
our consolidated third-party debt, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, together with our
finance lease obligations, aggregated £18.2 billion.

69


-----

Our ability to pay principal and interest on or to refinance the outstanding indebtedness depends upon our
operating performance, which will be affected by, among other things, general economic, financial, competitive,
regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Moreover, we may not be able to refinance
or redeem such debt on commercially reasonable terms, on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:

    - a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will have to be dedicated to the payment of
interest and principal on existing indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;

    - our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, product
development, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;

    - our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and
the industry in which we operate, and to technological and other changes may be limited;

    - we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged;

    - our substantial degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general
economic conditions or adverse developments in our business; and

    - we are exposed to risks inherent in interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our business and operations.

**_We may not be able to fund our debt service obligations in the future._**

We have significant outstanding indebtedness that could require a partial or comprehensive refinancing in
future periods. Borrowings under the VM Credit Facility are currently due between 2026 and 2031, while the
maturities of the Existing VM Notes currently range from 2026 to 2030 and the maturity for the Existing JV
Notes ranges from 2029 to 2031. See “Description of the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements” and
“Description of Other Debt”.

Our ability to implement such a refinancing successfully would be significantly dependent on stable debt
capital markets. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain sufficient cash flow in the future for the payment of
principal or interest on our indebtedness when due. Consequently, we may be forced to raise cash or reduce
expenses by doing one or more of the following:

    - raising additional debt;

    - restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness prior to maturity and/or on unfavorable terms;

    - selling or disposing of some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms;

    - issuing equity or equity-related instruments that will dilute the equity ownership interest of existing
stockholders; or

    - forgoing business opportunities, including the introduction of new products and services, acquisitions
and joint ventures.

We cannot be sure that any of, or a combination of, the above actions would be sufficient to fund our debt
service obligations, particularly in times of turbulent capital markets.

**_The covenants under our debt agreements place certain limitations on our ability to finance future operations_**
**_and how we manage our business._**

The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial maintenance tests and restrictive covenants
that restrict our ability to incur additional debt and limit the discretion of our management over various business
matters. For example, the financial maintenance tests include leverage ratios, and the restrictive covenants impact
our ability to:

    - pay dividends or make other distributions, or redeem or repurchase equity interests or subordinated
obligations;

    - make investments;

70


-----

    - sell assets, including the capital stock of certain entities;

    - enter into certain sale-and-leaseback transactions and certain vendor financing arrangements;

    - create liens;

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of certain of our entities to pay dividends, transfer assets
or make related-party loans;

    - merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

These limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay
dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants
could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, our ability to comply with the provisions of
our debt instruments may be affected by events beyond our control.

If we breach any of these covenants, or are unable to comply with the required financial ratios if the
drawings under our revolving credit facility exceed a certain percentage of the commitments under such
revolving credit facility, we may be in default under our debt instruments. A significant portion of our
indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable, and we may not have sufficient assets to repay
amounts due thereunder. In addition, any default under these facilities could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including
the indentures governing the Existing VM Notes.

These restrictions could also materially adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital
needs or to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. We may also incur other
indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable
under our current indebtedness.

**_We are exposed to pension liability for the defined benefit scheme of Telefonica UK Limited’s pension plan._**

The defined benefit section of the pension plan of Telefonica UK Limited (the “TUK Pension Plan”) had a
net liability (deficit) of £415.7 million on a technical provisions valuation basis as of September 30, 2020
compared to a £35 million surplus recognized on the balance sheet under IAS 19 as at December 31, 2020.
Deficit contributions totalling £425m have been agreed in relation to the technical provisions valuation as at
September 30, 2020, with £330m remaining to be paid during 2021 and 2022. Funding for these contributions
will be provided by Telefónica and its subsidiaries, subject to repayment of any tax saving arising from the
payment of such contributions into the TUK Pension Plan that would not otherwise have arisen. The funding
position of the defined benefit scheme of the TUK Pension Plan is based on a variety of assumptions and factors
outside of our control, including discount rates, inflation, asset returns, life expectancy and other actuarial
assumptions. Any variation in these assumptions could require the Group to make further contributions to the
defined benefit section of the TUK Pension Plan. Such contributions could be significant and have a negative
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

While the defined benefit scheme TUK Pension Plan closed to further benefit accrual in 2013, the Group is
committed to paying a defined level of benefits to eligible TUK Pension Plan participants. In the event that the
TUK Pension Plan assets will not be sufficient to cover the value of the benefits owed, the Group will be required
to finance such deficit and/or may be subject to investigation or enforcement action by the U.K. Pensions
Regulator, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to currency and interest rate risks._**

We are subject to currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and operating
expenses are paid in pound sterling, but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to portions of our
indebtedness in U.S. dollars and euro. To the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the U.S.
dollar and the euro (including as a result of Brexit, as discussed below), the effective cost of servicing our U.S.
dollar- and euro-denominated debt will be higher. Changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains
or losses. We are also subject to interest rate risks as we have certain interest determined on a variable basis,
either through unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts. We also incur costs in U.S. dollars

71


-----

and euro in the ordinary course of our business, including for CPE and network maintenance services. Any
deterioration in the value of the pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar or the euro could cause an increase in
the effective cost of purchases made in these currencies as only part of these exposures are hedged.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks and other adverse changes in the credit market. Shifts in such rates may_**
**_adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in
part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets,
including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to
obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be
affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in
significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would
likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption
in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and
such instability could also affect our access to financing.

In particular, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit
facilities of certain of our subsidiaries, which are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) or other base rates (including the Euro short-term rate). Although
we enter into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all. If we are unable to effectively
manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates would
increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with
our leveraged capital structure.

**_The phasing out of LIBOR and EURIBOR will result in a new reference rate being applied to our LIBOR-_**
**_indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt, which may not be the same as the new reference rate applied to our_**
**_LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments, and will have to be adjusted for._**

In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it
intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Additionally, the
European Money Markets Institute (the authority that administers EURIBOR) has announced that measures will
need to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure compliance with the EU’s Benchmarks
Regulation. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark administration (the entity that administers LIBOR) announced
its intention to continue publishing USD LIBOR rates until June 30, 2023, with the exception of the one-week
and two-month rates which, along with all GBP LIBOR rates, it intends to cease publishing after December 31,
2021. While this extension allows additional flexibility on existing contracts using USD LIBOR rates, companies
are still encouraged to transition from using USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and should not enter into new
contracts that use USD LIBOR after 2021. The methodology for EURIBOR has been reformed and EURIBOR
has been granted regulatory approval to continue to be used. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact
transitional arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made in the U.K., the U.S., the
Eurozone, Latin America or elsewhere given that a number of outcomes are possible, including the cessation of
the publication of one or more reference rates.

In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (the “ISDA”) launched a new
supplement (the “Fallback Supplement”), which from January 25, 2021, amended the standard definitions for
interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain key interbank offered rates
(IBORs). The ISDA also launched a new protocol (the “Fallback Protocol”), also effective January 25, 2021,
that enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives with other
counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol. The fallbacks for a particular currency will apply following a
permanent cessation of the IBOR in that currency and will be adjusted versions of the risk-free rates identified in
each currency. Our credit agreements contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate
applicable to our LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt to the extent LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable)
are not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what
would have been calculated under LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable). Additionally, no mandatory prepayment
or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that either the LIBOR rate or
the EURIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies to our
LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate that applies to our
LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. We anticipate managing this difference and any

72


-----

resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments.
However, future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and/or we
may incur significant associated costs.

**_We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our_**
**_liquidity, financial condition and cash flows._**

Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example,
high levels of sovereign debt, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to
fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability,
increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as
well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues,
concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as
well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single
currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone
countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European
monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries, or, in more extreme
circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the
redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows
to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of
our assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would
likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and
financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant
economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on
demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes
from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing
and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a
time frame that would allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light
of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative
instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our
company.

**_We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations._**

While our operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming and
operating costs, there is no assurance that they will be able to do so. Our ability to increase subscription rates is
subject to regulatory controls in the U.K. Further, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by
competitive pressures. Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material
negative impact on our cash flow and net earnings (loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in
salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs in the U.K.

**_We are subject to tax in more than one tax jurisdiction and our structure poses various tax risks._**

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the U.K. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by
a number of factors in addition to our operating results, including the amount of taxable income in particular
jurisdictions, the tax rates in those jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the manner in which and the
extent to which we transfer funds to and repatriate funds from our operating entities, accounting standards and
changes in accounting standards, and future changes in the law. We may incur losses in one jurisdiction that
cannot be offset against income earned in a different jurisdiction and, as a result, may pay income taxes in one
jurisdiction for a particular period even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for that period.

**_We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities._**

We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as VAT, in the U.K. and the U.S. In
addition, the tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of
intercompany services, cross-border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income
tax, VAT and transfer tax. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income
taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the

73


-----

jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material
differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made.

We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate,
including treaties between and among the U.K. and the U.S. Also, various income tax proposals in the
jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are
calculated. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a
materially higher income or non-income tax expense, and any such material changes could cause a material
change in our effective tax rate. In this regard, there have been significant changes or proposed changes to the tax
laws in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate, the impacts of which have been reflected accordingly in our
financial statements.

**_Adverse changes in our financial outlook may result in negative or unexpected tax consequences which could_**
**_adversely affect our net income._**

Future adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations could cause us
to establish a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which could materially and adversely affect our
consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. A change in this valuation allowance will not result in
any change to the amount of cash payments we make to the tax authorities.

**_Strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were_**
**_contemplated at the time of any transaction._**

From time to time we have made acquisitions, dispositions and have entered into other strategic transactions
(including spectrum auctions). In connection with such transactions (including the Joint Venture Transactions),
we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty integrating
the combined businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers, incur
significant indebtedness or experience delays in, or fail to proceed with, announced transactions.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or our reputation. See “—Risks
_Relating to the Joint Venture Transactions”._

**_Macroeconomic events, such as political unrest in international markets, terrorist attacks, malicious human_**
**_acts, natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics and other similar events may have an adverse effect on our_**
**_business, and the ability to repay the Notes._**

Our operations, and therefore the ability of the VM Credit Facility Obligors to repay the New Finco Loans
and, in turn, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes, are subject to macroeconomic risks, including but not limited
to political unrest, instability in international markets, terrorist attacks, malicious human acts, natural disasters,
pandemics and epidemics, that are outside of our control. For example, high levels of sovereign debt, combined
with weak growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity
measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk,
high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might
adversely impact our business.

**_We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our cash investments, derivative and other_**
**_financial instruments, and undrawn debt facilities._**

Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our cash investments, derivative and other
financial instruments, and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties will default
on their obligations to us. While we regularly review our credit exposures and currently have no specific
concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we
cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its
obligations to us. Any such instance of default or failure could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results
of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (i) we may incur losses to the extent that we are
unable to recover debts owed to us, including cash deposited and the value of financial losses, (ii) we may incur
significant costs to recover amounts owed to us, and such recovery may take a long period of time or may not be
possible at all, (iii) our derivative liabilities may be accelerated by the default of our counterparty, (iv) we may be
exposed to financial risks as a result of the termination of affected derivative contracts, and it may be costly or

74


-----

impossible to replace such contracts or otherwise mitigate such risks, (v) amounts available under committed
credit facilities may be reduced and (vi) disruption to the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to
access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our exposure to
counterparty credit risk included (i) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of £401.4 million and
(ii) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of £1,500.0 million. See “Capitalization of JV Holdco and the Issuer” and
“Summary—The Transactions—VM Revolving Credit Facility Transactions”.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure**

**_The Issuer is a financing company which will depend on payments under the New Finco Loans to provide it_**
**_with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes._**

The Issuer has been formed as a financing company for the primary purpose of issuing the Notes, entering
into the New Finco Loans and issuing or incurring certain other indebtedness. The Issuer is a financing company
that has no material business operations, no direct subsidiaries and no employees, and, following the Issue Date,
its only material assets will be its rights under the New Finco Loans, the Related Agreements, the Existing Finco
Loans and certain other related agreements. Furthermore, the Indenture will prohibit the Issuer from engaging in
any activities other than certain limited activities permitted under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer”. As such, the Issuer will be wholly_
dependent upon payments from the New VM Credit Facility Borrower, which payments are guaranteed by the
VM Credit Facility Guarantors, under the New Finco Loans, other than certain amounts due on the Notes (such
as prepayment premiums and additional amounts following certain tax events), which will be financed by the
New VM Credit Facility Borrower and/or VMIH pursuant to the relevant Related Agreement, in order to service
its obligations under the Notes.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s future obligations that are secured by assets_**
**_or property that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of all of the Issuer that
are secured by assets or property that does not secure the Notes, such that in the event of insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary, all of the Issuer’s creditors secured by
assets or property that do not secure the Notes would be entitled to payment in full before the Issuer would be
entitled to any payment.

**_Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to the Issuer, as payments under the Notes are limited to the_**
**_amount of certain payments received by the Issuer under the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement will be limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the Issuer
under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be made only from and to the extent of
such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer under the VM Credit Facility, the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements and the Related Agreements, and other than under the limited circumstances
described below under “Description of the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”, none of the Trustee, the
Security Trustee or the holders of Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event
that the amount due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and
the Collateral Sharing Agreement exceeds the amounts so received under the VM Credit Facility, the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements and the Related Agreements.

The Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not be permitted to take any action, commence any proceeding
or petition a court for the liquidation of the Issuer, nor will they be permitted to enter into any arrangement,
reorganization or insolvency proceeding in relation to the Issuer, whether under the laws of England and Wales
or other applicable bankruptcy laws. The obligations of the Issuer are solely obligations of the Issuer, and the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not have any recourse against any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Issuer for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, indemnities or other obligations whatsoever
in connection with any transactions contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement and the related documents. Having realized the Collateral securing the Notes and distributed
the net proceeds thereof, in each case in accordance with the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement,
none of the Trustee, the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes may take any further steps to recover any

75


-----

sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, any of the Notes Security Documents or the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or otherwise and all claims against the Issuer in respect of any such sum due but still unpaid
shall be extinguished.

**_The New VM Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors conduct no business_**
**_operations of their own. The New VM Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the VM Credit Facility_**
**_Guarantors will depend on payments from the other members of the Group to make payments on the New_**
**_Finco Loans._**

The New VM Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors conduct no
business operations of their own. The ability of any members of the Bank Group to pay dividends or to make
other payments or advances to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and such VM Credit Facility Guarantors
depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which
they may be or may become subject and in some cases the New VM Credit Facility Borrower’s and certain of the
VM Credit Facility Guarantors’ receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax
consequences. Most of the Bank Group’s operating subsidiaries are, or will be, subject to the limitations and
restrictions in the VM Credit Facility and/or other debt facilities that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit
the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders and partners,
including the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors. In addition,
because these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, they have no obligation to provide the New VM
Credit Facility Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Guarantors funds for payment obligations, whether by
dividends, distributions, loans or other payments, except for those subsidiaries which are VM Credit Facility
Guarantors. If the members of the Bank Group are unable to make distributions or other payments to the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower and certain of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors, the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower and such VM Credit Facility Guarantors expect to have no other sources of funds that would allow
them to make payments under the New Finco Loans or the Related Agreements and, in turn, allow the Issuer to
make payments under the Notes.

There can be no assurance that arrangements with the Bank Group entities and the funding permitted by the
agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Bank Group will provide the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Guarantors with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund
payments under the relevant New Finco Loans or the Related Agreements, and in turn, fund payments by the
Issuer under the Notes, when due.

**_Holders of the Notes have limited direct recourse to the VM Credit Facility Obligors._**

Except for the specific interests of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender under the VM Credit Facility
or as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, no proprietary or other direct interest in the Issuer’s rights
under or in respect of the VM Credit Facility exists for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Further, subject to
the terms of the Indenture, no holder of Notes can enforce any provision of the VM Credit Facility or have direct
recourse to the VM Credit Facility Obligors, or any other member of the Bank Group, except through an action
by the Issuer, itself acting as directed by the Trustee pursuant to the rights granted to the Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee under and in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents and the Collateral
Sharing Agreement.

Under the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be required to take proceedings to enforce payment under the VM
Credit Facility unless it has been indemnified and/or secured by the holders of the Notes to its satisfaction and
subject further to such enforcement being instructed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing
Agreement, which will provide that the holders and/or the lenders, as applicable, of the majority in the aggregate
principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and Additional Debt outstanding which share the
benefit of the Collateral, will control any enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral. In addition, none of the
Issuer, the Trustee or the Security Trustee is required to monitor any member of the Bank Group’s financial or
contractual performance.

**_By investing in the Notes you will have provided advance consent to the VM Credit Facility Amendments_**
**_which will automatically become effective without any further consent from holders of the Notes upon VMIH_**
**_obtaining the consent of either the Instructing Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) or, with respect to_**
**_certain amendments, all VM Credit Facility Lenders._**

Each of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements contains the consent of the Issuer, as a VM Credit
Facility Lender, to the VM Credit Facility Amendments. Accordingly, while the Issuer will have the same voting

76


-----

rights as the other VM Credit Facility Lenders in all matters under the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer will have
already provided its consent to any and all of the VM Credit Facility Amendments at the time it enters into the
New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, as applicable and, therefore, it will not be entitled to vote on any
request for consent to the VM Credit Facility Amendments. As a result, the holders of Notes will not, directly or
indirectly, be entitled to direct the vote of the Issuer on such matters in the event VMIH solicits the consents for
any or all of these amendments to the VM Credit Facility or receive any consent fee or similar fee that may be
paid to other VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit Facility in connection with their approval of these
amendments.

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit
Facility. In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise
consent) (including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter arising from time to
time under the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, as applicable, in which the
Issuer or all VM Credit Facility Lenders are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will
solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the Notes and any other applicable series of Additional Debt
with respect to such VM Credit Facility Decision (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture.

The Issuer will, under (and effective as of the date of) each of the New Finco Facility Accession
Agreements, on behalf of holders of the applicable Notes, provide its consent as a VM Credit Facility Lender, to
any and all of the VM Credit Facility Amendments (notwithstanding that the Issuer may otherwise be eligible to
vote as a VM Credit Facility Lender if VMIH sought the consent of the VM Credit Facility Lenders with respect
to such matters). The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder Consent (as defined in the “Description of the
_Notes”) equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding in respect of any and all of the VM_
Credit Facility Amendments for the purposes of the provisions of the Indenture described below under
“Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco
_Facility Accession Agreements”. As a result, the Issuer will not solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders_
of the Notes with respect to the VM Credit Facility Amendments. In addition, the Issuer will not be entitled to
receive, and will expressly waive under the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, any right it may have to,
any consent, waiver, amendment or other similar fee that may be paid to other VM Credit Facility Lenders in
connection with their approval of the VM Credit Facility Amendments (including the Issuer in respect of any
additional Finco Facility Accession Agreement, or similar instrument or agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer
advances the proceeds of Additional Debt (including any Additional Notes) into the Bank Group).

The VM Credit Facility Amendments include material modifications to certain affirmative and negative
covenants, financial maintenance covenants and related definitions, representations and warranties, events of
default, administrative provisions and provisions relating to the security package securing the VM Credit Facility
and the approval of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (in substantially the form attached as Annex C to
this offering memorandum). The VM Credit Facility Amendments are generally less restrictive and provide
greater flexibility to the Bank Group than the provisions currently included in the VM Credit Facility. For a
summary of the key amendments included in the VM Credit Facility Amendments, please see “Description of the
_VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility—Proposed Amendments to the VM Credit_
_Facility”. Given the significant nature of these amendments, you should read the full list of amendments set out_
in Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7 to the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements in their entirety before investing in
the Notes.

The VM Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective upon the approval by lenders
constituting the Instructing Group (as currently defined in the VM Credit Facility, without giving effect to the
VM Credit Facility Amendments). However, certain of the VM Credit Facility Amendments, including those
related to extending the date of any payment and releasing guarantors and collateral, will become effective only
upon the approval of all VM Credit Facility Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit Facility and
the other creditors under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed
and the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the VM Credit Facility and the Existing
VM Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (which takes effect by way
of amendment and restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will establish the relative rights of the VM
Credit Facility Lenders, the holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors under other
financing arrangements of the Group.

**_The security interest in the VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the New Finco Loans will not be granted_**
**_directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the New Finco Loans will not be granted
directly to holders of the Notes. Instead, they will be granted in favor of the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee
for the benefit of the VM Credit Facility Lenders, including the Issuer under the New Finco Loans, and the
Issuer’s interest in the New Finco Loans will in turn serve as Collateral for the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes.

As a result, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes, the Trustee on behalf of the holders
of the Notes will not have the right to enforce the collateral for the New Finco Loans directly but, instead, would
only have the right, through the Security Trustee (and subject to the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement),
to enforce the security interest in the Issuer’s interest in the New Finco Loans (subject always to the Trustee and/
or the Security Trustee, as applicable, being directed by the holders of the Notes and indemnified and/or secured
to its satisfaction against any liabilities it may incur, and subject further to such enforcement being instructed in
accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement, which will provide that the holders and/or the
lenders, as applicable, of the majority in the aggregate principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional
Notes) and Additional Debt outstanding which share the benefit of the Collateral, will control any enforcement
actions in respect of the Collateral, including the New Finco Loans). This indirect claim over the VM Credit
Facility Collateral could delay or make more costly any realization of such VM Credit Facility Collateral.

**_The Issuer will share all security equally and ratably with the other VM Credit Facility Lenders, holders of_**
**_our Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain additional secured indebtedness we will be permitted by_**
**_the VM Credit Facility to incur in the future. If there is a default, the value of the VM Credit Facility_**
**_Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the Issuer under the New Finco Loans and the lenders under such_**
**_other indebtedness._**

The New Finco Loans and the VM Credit Facility Guarantees are secured equally and ratably with the other
borrowings under the VM Credit Facility, the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and additional secured
indebtedness permitted by the VM Credit Facility to be incurred in the future, subject to compliance with
covenants in our outstanding debt agreements. The VM Credit Facility will permit the incurrence of additional
secured indebtedness which would share the VM Credit Facility Collateral equally and ratably with the New
Finco Loans. As a result, if there is a default, the remaining security may not be sufficient to repay the Issuer as a
VM Credit Facility Lender and the other lenders under any such additional secured indebtedness.

**_The value of the VM Credit Facility Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the VM Credit_**
**_Facility Obligors under the New Finco Loans._**

No appraisal of the value of the VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the New Finco Loans has been made
in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the VM Credit Facility Collateral is subject to
fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions and similar factors. The
amount to be received upon a sale of the VM Credit Facility Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the VM Credit Facility Collateral at such time, the
timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By their nature, portions of the VM Credit
Facility Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a
foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the VM Credit Facility Collateral may not be sold in a
timely or orderly manner. The proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the security will generally be used to
repay all senior secured indebtedness, including the outstanding amounts under the VM Credit Facility and the
Existing VM Senior Secured Notes on a pro rata basis, and may not be sufficient to pay the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower’s obligations under the New Finco Loans or the VM Credit Facility Guarantors’ guarantees
thereof.

**_The VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the New Finco Loans is subject to casualty risks._**

Some of the VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the VM Credit Facility is either uninsurable or not
economically insurable, in whole or in part. Consequently, we may not be fully compensated by insurance
proceeds for any losses we may suffer. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the VM Credit Facility
Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy the Group’s senior secured obligations,
including the VM Credit Facility and the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes.

**_The New Finco Loans will be secured over substantially the same assets that secure the VM Credit Facility_**
**_and the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer may not control actions relating to enforcement of_**
**_the VM Credit Facility Collateral._**

The rights of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender with respect to the VM Credit Facility Collateral
will be subject to our Group Intercreditor Deed. Under the Group Intercreditor Deed, any enforcement actions
that may be taken with respect to the VM Credit Facility Collateral will be controlled by the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee. The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee is required to take enforcement action upon receiving
instructions from an instructing group of holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
all our liabilities that qualify as “Senior Liabilities” under (and as defined in) our Group Intercreditor Deed which
includes any Existing VM Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding, the New Finco Loans and other
borrowings under the VM Credit Facility. As a result, in the event of a default, we anticipate that actions relating
to enforcement of the VM Credit Facility Collateral may not be controlled by the Issuer. See “Description of the
_Intercreditor Deeds—Group Intercreditor Deed”. Upon receipt of the required consents from VM Credit Facility_
Lenders under the VM Credit Facility and the other creditors under certain of our other financing arrangements,
the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern rights of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender
with respect to the VM Credit Facility Collateral and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement
(which takes effect by way of amendment and restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will instead establish
the relative rights of the VM Credit Facility Lenders and certain creditors under other financing arrangements of
the Group. See “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds—New Group Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_Holders of the Notes are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale_**
**_on a pari passu basis with any Additional Debt of the Issuer, and the value of the Collateral may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes._**

Holders of the Notes will benefit directly from security interests granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of
itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has
been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations
based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be
received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the
actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability
of buyers. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not
be sold in a timely or orderly manner. The proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the security will generally be
used to repay the Notes and any other existing or future senior secured Additional Debt of the Issuer that is not
subordinated to the Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_**
**_released without your consent._**

The security for the benefit of the Notes in the Collateral may be released under various circumstances,
including following an Event of Default (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture or a
default under other Additional Debt of the Issuer secured by the Collateral, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral
Sharing Agreement at the direction of the relevant instructing group thereunder. The Indenture also permits
amendments to any Notes Security Documents or the provisions of the Indenture dealing with Notes Security
Documents, which are, taken as a whole, materially adverse to the holders of the Notes or otherwise release the
Collateral with the consent of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. In addition, in
connection with any Additional Debt that can be incurred and secured by the same Collateral, the security over
the Collateral may be released and retaken which may lead to renewed hardening periods and may limit your
recovery in an enforcement proceeding.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the New Finco Loans under which the VM_**
**_Credit Facility Collateral will be released without the consent of either the Issuer or holders of the Notes._**

The VM Credit Facility Collateral for the benefit of the VM Credit Facility Lenders may be released under
various circumstances, including (i) upon a sale or other disposal permitted by the terms of the VM Credit
Facility, (ii) upon any release in connection with an enforcement action by the VM Credit Facility Security
Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed acting at the direction of the Instructing Group or
(iii) in the case of VM Credit Facility Collateral owned by a VM Credit Facility Guarantor, when such VM
Credit Facility Guarantor is released from its VM Credit Facility Guarantee. The VM Credit Facility Collateral

79


-----

includes liens on substantially all of the assets of VMIH and each other VM Credit Facility Guarantor
(collectively, the “VM Credit Facility Asset Collateral”). The VM Credit Facility Asset Collateral will,
however, be automatically released without the need for any consent from the Issuer or holders of the Notes on
the Asset Security Release Date and replaced with share charges over all of the capital stock of the VM Credit
Facility Obligors. The VM Credit Facility also permits amendments to any Security Documents (as defined
therein) or the provisions of the VM Credit Facility dealing with Security Documents, which may be, when taken
as a whole, materially adverse to VM Credit Facility Lenders or the release of all or substantially all of the VM
Credit Facility Collateral with the consent of the Instructing Group (which may not include the Issuer). In
addition, in connection with any additional secured indebtedness that can be incurred, the VM Credit Facility
Collateral may be released and retaken which may lead to renewed hardening periods in various jurisdictions and
may limit recovery in enforcement proceedings.

**_Your rights in the Collateral and the Issuer’s rights in the VM Credit Facility Collateral may be adversely_**
**_affected by the failure to perfect certain security interests in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest
can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Trustee, the Security
Trustee and the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee will not monitor, or we may not inform the Trustee, the
Security Trustee or the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee of, the future acquisition of property and rights that
constitute Collateral or VM Credit Facility Collateral, as applicable, and necessary action may not be taken to
properly perfect such after-acquired security interest. The Trustee, the Security Trustee and the VM Credit
Facility Security Trustee have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute Collateral or VM Credit Facility Collateral, as applicable, or the perfection of any security interest in
favor of the Notes or the New Finco Loans, as applicable, against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss
of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes or the New Finco
Loans, as applicable, against third parties.

**_Certain assets are excluded from the VM Credit Facility Collateral._**

Certain assets are excluded from the security for the benefit of the New Finco Loans under the VM Credit
Facility Collateral, including:

    - any security for purchase money indebtedness or capitalized lease obligations;

    - any assets secured pursuant to certain liens permitted under the VM Credit Facility;

    - interests in certain excluded subsidiaries, non-recourse special purpose vehicles and joint ventures; and

    - any assets that are expressly excluded from the VM Credit Facility Collateral securing the VM Credit
Facility or any other indebtedness ranking pari passu with the New Finco Loans and our VM Credit
Facility which is outstanding from time to time.

If an event of default occurs and the New Finco Loans are accelerated, the New Finco Loans will rank
equally with all of our other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities with respect to such
excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the VM Credit Facility Collateral granted in respect of the New Finco
Loans and the VM Credit Facility Guarantees is less than the value of the claims of the Issuer, no assurance can
be provided that the Issuer would receive any substantial recovery from the excluded assets.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the New Finco Loans under which the VM_**
**_Credit Facility Guarantees will be released automatically, without the Issuer’s consent._**

Each VM Credit Facility Guarantee by a VM Credit Facility Guarantor will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged, and each VM Credit Facility Guarantor and its obligations under such
VM Credit Facility Guarantee, the VM Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Deeds will be released and
discharged in certain circumstances including, without limitation, certain sales, exchanges, transfers or
dispositions of such VM Credit Facility Guarantor (resulting in such VM Credit Facility Guarantor no longer
being within the Bank Group) or all or substantially all of the assets of such VM Credit Facility Guarantor. In
addition, VM Credit Facility Guarantees may be released in certain other circumstances, including, without
limitation, in connection with a Post-Closing Reorganization and/or a Permitted Tax Reorganization (each as
defined in the VM Credit Facility). Furthermore, any VM Credit Facility Guarantee may be released with the
consent of the Instructing Group (which may not require the consent of the Issuer). As a result of these and other
provisions in the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts from the VM Credit

80


-----

Facility Guarantors under the VM Credit Facility Guarantees in the event of a default on the New Finco Loans
and certain of the VM Credit Facility Guarantees may be released without any alternative recovery being
available.

**_The New Finco Loans will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of the VM Credit Facility Obligors’_**
**_respective subsidiaries that are not VM Credit Facility Obligors and will be effectively subordinated to any of_**
**_the VM Credit Facility Obligors’ existing and future obligations that are secured by liens senior to the liens_**
**_securing the New Finco Loans or the VM Credit Facility Guarantees or assets or property that do not secure_**
**_the New Finco Loans or the VM Credit Facility Guarantees._**

Since none of the VM Credit Facility Obligors’ subsidiaries (which are not themselves VM Credit Facility
Guarantors) will guarantee the New Finco Loans on the Issue Date, the New Finco Loans and the VM Credit
Facility Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of such subsidiaries. In addition, the VM
Credit Facility will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-guarantors to incur additional indebtedness,
which may also be secured, and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade
payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Consequently, creditors of such additional indebtedness are
entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to any VM Credit Facility Guarantor. Moreover, in the event that any
non-guarantor subsidiary become insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, the creditors of the VM Credit
Facility Guarantors (including the Issuer and other VM Credit Facility Lenders) will have no right to proceed
against such subsidiary’s assets and the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any VM Credit Facility
Guarantor will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the New Finco Loans and
the VM Credit Facility Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

In addition, the New Finco Loans and/or the VM Credit Facility Guarantees, as applicable, will be
effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of the relevant VM Credit Facility Obligor that is secured
by liens senior to the liens securing the New Finco Loans or the VM Credit Facility Guarantees, or secured by
property or assets that do not secure the New Finco Loans or the VM Credit Facility Guarantees, to the extent of
the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. Although the VM Credit Facility contains
restrictions on the ability of the respective subsidiaries of the VM Credit Facility Obligors to incur additional
debt as well as on the ability of the VM Credit Facility Obligors to incur additional secured debt, any additional
debt or additional secured debt incurred may be substantial.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the VM Credit Facility Guarantees may adversely affect their validity_**
**_and enforceability._**

Certain of the VM Credit Facility Obligors (including the New VM Credit Facility Borrower) and certain of
the other members of the Bank Group are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed
by, English insolvency law. In addition, English insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors as the laws
of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In addition, certain VM Credit
Facility Obligors are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, applicable insolvency laws in such jurisdictions and
limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts would limit the enforceability of
judgments against the VM Credit Facility Obligors. The following discussion of insolvency law, although an
overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdictions’
insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors or an
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the VM Credit Facility Guarantees, and intercompany
obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a
court, if it makes certain findings, to:

    - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a VM Credit Facility Guarantor’s obligations under its VM Credit
Facility Guarantee;

81


-----

    - direct that the VM Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) return any amounts paid under a VM
Credit Facility Guarantee to the relevant VM Credit Facility Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of
the relevant VM Credit Facility Guarantor’s creditors; and

    - take other action that is detrimental to VM Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) and,
indirectly, holders of the Notes.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a VM Credit Facility
Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the VM Credit Facility Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the
method of valuation, a court would not determine that a VM Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on that date,
or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a VM Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent
on the date its VM Credit Facility Guarantee was issued, that payments to the Issuer under the New Finco Loans
to, in turn, make payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

In the event that the validity or enforceability of the VM Credit Facility Guarantees is adversely affected, we
cannot assure you that the Issuer will ever be able to repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

Furthermore, under English insolvency law, some of our and our subsidiaries’ debts may be entitled to
priority, including amounts owed in respect of various U.K. social security contributions, amounts owed in
respect of occupational pension schemes, certain amounts owed to employees and liquidation expenses. The
Finance Act 2020 provides that, with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1, 2020,
claims by HMRC dating from before the onset of the relevant company’s insolvency in respect of certain taxes
including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee national insurance
contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer
national insurance contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers will also
be entitled to priority.

**_Laws relating to preferences and transactions at an undervalue may adversely affect the validity and_**
**_enforceability of payments under the VM Credit Facility Guarantees by the VM Credit Facility Guarantors._**

A significant number of the VM Credit Facility Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to
the court to challenge transactions entered into by that company if the company was unable to pay its debts (as
defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of the transaction or if the company became unable to pay
its debts as a result of the transaction. Generally, only an administrator or liquidator of a company may bring a
claim challenging a reviewable transaction. For example, transactions that can be challenged include preferences
and transactions at an undervalue.

A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company
making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the
company received significantly less value (in money or money’s worth) than it gave in return. The court can set
aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending with the
onset of insolvency. A court generally will not intervene in circumstances where a company entered into the
transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of
the Notes that in the event of insolvency the VM Credit Facility Guarantees would not be challenged by a
liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that the guarantees have been entered into in
good faith for the purposes described above.

A transaction might be challenged as a preference where, in the event of the relevant company going into
insolvent liquidation, the relevant company has done something or suffered something to be done which has the
effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position than the creditor, surety or guarantor would
have otherwise been in. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to prefer that party. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety
or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what
it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments under
the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific
circumstances for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted
in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and

82


-----

that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which case it is presumed that the
company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there
was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the preference is given to a person
connected to the company (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), the court looks
back and sets aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of
the company’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only go back and set
aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency.

If a court voided any VM Credit Facility Guarantee, or any payment thereunder, as a result of a transaction
at an undervalue or a preference, or held it unenforceable or set it aside for any other reason (including by reason
of fraudulent transfer or conveyance), the VM Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) would cease to have
any claim against the applicable VM Credit Facility Guarantor under its VM Credit Facility Guarantee. In such
circumstances, if the New VM Credit Facility Borrower cannot satisfy its obligations under the New Finco
Loans, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will be able to ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the
Notes.

**_The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act may affect the ability of creditors to commence insolvency_**
**_proceedings._**

The U.K. Government introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill into the U.K. Parliament
on May 20, 2020 and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act (“CIGA”) came into effect on June 26,
2020. The U.K. Government also introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)
(Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on September 29, 2020; the
Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Early Termination of Certain Temporary
Provisions) Regulation 2020, which came into effect on October 1, 2020; the Corporate Insolvency and
Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and Extension of the
Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on November 26, 2020; and the Corporate Insolvency
and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) (No 2) Regulations 2020, which
came into effect on December 9, 2020 (together, the “CIGA Regulations”).

The CIGA has introduced significant new corporate restructuring tools to the U.K. insolvency regime. Some
of the new measures are temporary in nature and have been introduced specifically to support businesses
experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CIGA
Regulations have extended the effect of certain temporary measures due to the continuing impact of COVID-19.
The new temporary measures include a suspension of the personal liability of directors for wrongful trading
(which applied retrospectively from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 and for a second period from
November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021). CIGA also introduced a prohibition on the presentation of winding-up
petitions on or after April 27, 2020 as a result of a company’s failure to meet a statutory demand served on them
between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. In addition, until June 30, 2021, a creditor cannot present a
winding-up petition based on a company’s inability to pay its debts unless they have reasonable grounds to
believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a financial effect on the company, or the relevant facts giving
rise to such winding-up petition would have arisen even if the COVID-19 pandemic had not had a financial effect
on the company. Other new measures are permanent rather than temporary in nature and may have a significant
impact on the way creditors and others interact with businesses in financial difficulty.

The CIGA has introduced permanent reforms in three key areas: a free-standing moratorium under Part A1
of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Free-standing Moratorium”), a ban on the operation by a supplier of
termination provisions which are based on a formal insolvency procedure in contracts for the supply of goods
and/or services (or so called ipso facto clauses), with exemptions for certain entities and financial contracts and
the introduction of a restructuring plan for a company in financial difficulty under Part 26A of the Companies
Act 2006 (the “Part 26A Restructuring Plan”).

The aim of the Free-standing Moratorium is to stay creditor action against a distressed but viable company
in order to facilitate a rescue as a going concern and/or restructuring. The Free-standing Moratorium is available
to eligible companies, for a limited initial period of 20 business days subject to permitted extensions. Any
extension beyond 40 business days will require the consent of the company’s pre-moratorium creditors (among
other conditions) or the consent of court. The Free-standing Moratorium is supervised by a licenced insolvency
practitioner, who is appointed as ‘monitor’. The Free-standing Moratorium gives the company a payment holiday

83


-----

for specified debts. It also restricts creditor action and enforcement (for example, no floating charge holder is
able to give notice to crystallize a floating charge (subject to certain exceptions)), whilst imposing controls on the
company entering into certain transactions. The Free-standing Moratorium does not provide a payment holiday
for, among other things, pre-moratorium debts arising under certain financial services contracts (including, for
example, loan and other credit agreements). Certain companies are excluded from being eligible for the Freestanding Moratorium including, among others, insurance companies, certain financial institutions and any
company that is party to a ‘capital market arrangement’. A capital market arrangement is an arrangement
regarding a debt of at least £10 million under the arrangement (at any time during the life of the capital market
arrangement), where a company has provided security to a trustee or agent, guaranteed or secured the obligations
of another party, or invested in certain options, futures or other derivatives, in each case under a capital markets
instrument.

The provisions under the CIGA that ban the operation of termination provisions in contracts for the supply
of goods and/or services where the company has entered into a relevant insolvency procedure (including the
Free-standing Moratorium, administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement,
provisional liquidation or a Part 26A Restructuring Plan) will help to prevent the disruption of supply chains but
may have a significant effect on suppliers. The CIGA Regulations extended a temporary measured introduced by
the CIGA, which excludes small suppliers from the effects of restriction on termination through to June 30, 2021.

The Part 26A Restructuring Plan offers an alternative to the existing scheme of arrangement. Similar to a
scheme of arrangement the Part 26A Restructuring Plan needs to be court-approved and requires a creditor
meeting and vote. However, unlike a scheme of arrangement, subject to certain conditions, the Part 26A
Restructuring Plan may bind certain dissenting classes of creditors, known as a “cross-class cram-down”. This
means that a Part 26A Restructuring Plan may be adopted even where one or more class does not vote in favor of
the plan provided (a) the court is satisfied that if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were sanctioned no creditor in
the dissenting class would be worse off than it would be in what the court considers to be the most likely
alternative scenario for the company if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned and (b) the Part 26A
Restructuring Plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors who would
receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the most likely
alternative scenario referred to in (a) above.

The Free-standing Moratorium and cross-class cram-down restructuring procedures in particular have a
significant effect on the ability of creditors and others to commence insolvency proceedings and on the
enforcement of rights and legal proceedings, including, among other things, rights under a floating charge. The
provisions under CIGA which ban the operation of ipso facto clauses will help to prevent the disruption of supply
chains but may have a significant effect on suppliers.

**_An active trading market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, and the price of the Notes may_**
**_fluctuate._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer intends to make an application for listing on the Official List
of The International Stock Exchange and admission to trading on The International Stock Exchange, but the
Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer can no longer maintain the
listing on Official List of The International Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or
maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, preparation of financial statements in accordance with any
accounting standard other than the standard pursuant to which the Issuer then prepares its financial statements
shall be deemed unduly burdensome), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on Official List of
The International Stock Exchange, provided that the Issuer will use all reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the
European Union or the U.K.), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing (whether on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield
issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest
payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

The Notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. If a trading market
does not develop, or if a trading market develops but is not maintained, holders of the Notes may experience
difficulty in reselling the Notes or may be unable to sell them at all. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of the
Notes that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if a market develops, will be maintained or as
to the liquidity of the market for the Notes.

84


-----

The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, the interest of
securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the
development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If there is no active trading market for the Notes, the
market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount to their initial issue price depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
general economic conditions, our performance and business prospects and certain other factors.

Factors including the following may have a significant effect on the market price of the Notes:

    - actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including our ability to generate cash flow
from operations;

    - our perceived business prospects;

    - our ability or perceived ability to access capital markets and other sources of financing in the future;

    - general economic conditions, including prevailing interest rates; and

    - the market for similar securities.

**_The VM Senior Notes Issuer and certain other holding companies will not be subject to the covenants in the_**
**_VM Credit Facility._**

The VM Senior Notes Issuer will guarantee the VM Credit Facility, but will not be directly subject to the
covenants in the VM Credit Facility. As a result, the VM Credit Facility will not restrict the ability of the VM
Senior Notes Issuer to incur additional debt (secured or unsecured), sell, encumber or dispose of assets, pay
dividends, make other distributions or enter into transactions with its affiliates. In addition, certain intermediate
holding companies will not be parties to the VM Credit Facility and so are not subject to these restrictions. Any
such transactions by any of these entities could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the VM Senior
Notes Issuer to make payments in respect of its VM Credit Facility Guarantee.

**_The Issuer’s ability to enforce its rights under the VM Credit Facility, including the right to accelerate_**
**_payments under the New Finco Loans following the occurrence of an event of default under the VM Credit_**
**_Facility is limited._**

The occurrence of an event of default under the VM Credit Facility will not automatically result in the New
Finco Loans becoming due and payable. Only the VM Credit Facility Agent may take enforcement steps upon
the occurrence of such an event of default. The VM Credit Facility Agent may, and must if so instructed by the
Instructing Group under (and as defined in) the VM Credit Facility, accelerate amounts due under the VM Credit
Facility (including under the New Finco Loans) following the occurrence of such an event of default. The
Issuer’s share in outstanding loans and undrawn commitments under the VM Credit Facility is likely to
contribute significantly less than the threshold required for such Instructing Group definition, which is generally
50% of the aggregate of all outstanding loans and undrawn commitments under the VM Credit Facility.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to require an acceleration of its rights under
the New Finco Loans following the occurrence of an event of default under the VM Credit Facility.

**_The New VM Credit Facility Borrower may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance_**
**_required prepayments of the VM Credit Facility (including prepayment of the New Finco Loans), and the_**
**_Issuer therefore may not be able to obtain funds to repurchase the Notes, upon the occurrence of a Change of_**
**_Control (as defined in the VM Credit Facility)._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and if the Instructing Group thereunder so requires, the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower will be required to prepay the VM Credit Facility (including the New Finco Loans),
and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will be required to make an additional payment to the Issuer equal to
1% of the principal amount of the relevant New Finco Loans. Following any such repayment, the Issuer will
redeem all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption. Holders of the Notes
will not be entitled to a redemption in connection with a Change of Control unless the Instructing Group under
the VM Credit Facility requires that the New VM Credit Facility Borrower prepay the VM Credit Facility and as
a result the Issuer may not control actions relating to prepayment of the VM Credit Facility in the event of a
Change of Control.

85


-----

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at
such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower to prepay
the relevant New Finco Loan, or that the restrictions in the Existing VM Financing Facilities, the indentures
governing the Existing VM Notes or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us, to make such
required prepayment. A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the
Existing VM Financing Facilities, the Existing VM Notes and other indebtedness of the Group. The acceleration
or prepayment of the New Finco Loans could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of
Control itself does not.

The ability of the New VM Credit Facility Borrower to receive cash from its subsidiaries or other members
of the Group to allow the New VM Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the New Finco Loans (and in turn for the
Issuer to redeem the Notes), following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then
existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
prepayment. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing
funds to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower for the purpose of prepaying the New Finco Loans, we may seek
the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to prepay the New Finco Loans (and in turn for the Issuer to
repurchase the Notes) or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent
to repay such borrowings is not obtained or such refinancing cannot be consummated, the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower will remain prohibited from prepaying the New Finco Loans. In addition, we expect that we
would require third-party financing to make a prepayment of the New Finco Loans upon a Change of Control.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower to prepay the New Finco Loans would constitute a default under the VM Credit Facility which would,
in turn, constitute a default under the indentures governing the Existing VM Notes and the Indenture. See
“Description of the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility—Principal Terms and
_Tranches—Mandatory Prepayment”._

The Change of Control provision contained in the VM Credit Facility may not necessarily afford the VM
Credit Facility Lenders, and in turn holders of the Notes, protection in the event of certain important corporate
events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, a spin-off of the reference entity for purposes of the
definition of “Change of Control” to the shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings in such reference entity
or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect the VM Credit Facility Lenders, and in turn
holders of the Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial
ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the VM Credit Facility.

Except as described under “Description of the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—VM Credit
_Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—Mandatory Prepayment”, the VM Credit Facility will not contain_
provisions that would require the New VM Credit Facility Borrower to prepay the New Finco Loans, and in turn
the Issuer to redeem the Notes, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization, spin-off or
similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the VM Credit Facility includes a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of Virgin Media Investment Holdings, any Permitted Affiliate Parent (including the New VM
Credit Facility Borrower) and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person (other than a Permitted
Holder) (each as defined in the VM Credit Facility). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of VMIH, the VM Credit Facility Guarantors
and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the New VM Credit Facility Borrower is
required to prepay the New Finco Loans, and in turn whether the Issuer is required to redeem the Notes.

**_The VM Credit Facility permits us to dispose of our assets and business relating to our business division._**

The VM Credit Facility permits us to sell the assets relating to our business division or to contribute them to
a joint venture. In each such case, business division assets would no longer be held by an entity that is subject to
the covenants contained in the VM Credit Facility. As a result, we may undertake transactions related to these
assets (such as selling them or securing debt on them) which will not be subject to the limitations of the
covenants, and we would potentially lose access to all or a portion of the cash flows generated by these assets as
well as the value of these assets.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that
a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets._**

Pursuant to the recommendation of the Green Bond Principles that issuers use external assurance to confirm
their alignment with the key features of the Green Bond Principles, Sustainalytics, a provider of environmental,
social and governance (“ESG”) research and analysis, has been engaged to provide an independent second-party
opinion (the “Second-Party Opinion”) in relation to the alignment of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
with the 2021 Green Bond Principles and to provide views on the robustness and credibility of the VMED O2
Green Bond Framework (which views are intended to inform investors in general, and not for a specific
investor). Accordingly, on June 14, 2021, Sustainalytics certified that the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework
aligns with the 2021 Green Bond Principles. The Second-Party Opinion is not incorporated into, and does not
form part of, this offering memorandum.

There is currently no clearly defined definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus on,
what precise attributes are required for a particular company to be defined as “green”, “sustainable” or such other
equivalent label, and nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over
time. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the VM Eligible Green Projects will meet all investor expectations
or requirements regarding “green”, “sustainable”, “social” or similar labels (including Regulation (EU) 2020/852
on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment). Further, no assurances can be provided
that allocations to projects with these specific characteristics will be made by us with respect to an amount equal
to the net proceeds from the Notes. There is no guarantee as to the environmental and/or social impacts of the
VM Eligible Green Projects.

Neither the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Initial Purchasers nor their affiliates
make any representation as to: (i) the suitability of any opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not
solicited by the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings or the JV Holdco) or the Notes to fulfil any environmental
and sustainability criteria; (ii) whether the Notes will meet investor criteria and expectations with regard to
environmental impact and sustainability performance; (iii) whether an amount equal to the net proceeds of the
Notes will be used to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects; or (iv) the
characteristics of the VM Eligible Green Projects, including their environmental and sustainability criteria. The
Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional
risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion is
not a recommendation by the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as at the date of the Second Party Opinion. Moreover,
the Second Party Opinion provider and providers of similar opinions and certifications are not currently subject
to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be
deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Initial Purchasers
or their affiliates, any second party opinion providers, or any other person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Holders
of the Notes have no recourse against the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates, or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such
opinion or certification, including as to suitability or reliability for any purpose, which is only current as at the
date it was initially issued.

In the event that the Notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated “green”, “environmental”,
“sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange or securities market (whether or not
regulated), no representation or assurance is given by the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the
Initial Purchasers or any other person that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any

87


-----

present or future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with
which such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or
regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with
regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects or uses, the subject
of or related to, any VM Eligible Green Projects. Furthermore, it should be noted that the criteria for any such
listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or securities market to another. No
representation or assurance can be given or made by the Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the
Initial Purchasers or any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of
any such Notes or, if obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of
the Notes.

Each potential investor in the Notes must make its own determination with respect to the relevance of the
information contained in this offering memorandum regarding the use of proceeds, and its purchase of Notes
should be based upon such investigation as it deems necessary. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion or any
failure by Virgin Media to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to VM
Eligible Green Projects or to meet or continue to meet the investment requirements of certain environmentally
focused investors with respect to the Notes may affect the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for
certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in “green” assets.

The Issuer, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates make no
assurances as to (i) whether the Notes offered hereby will meet investor criteria and expectations regarding
environmental impact and sustainability performance for any particular investors, (ii) whether the net proceeds
will be used for the VM Eligible Green Projects, (iii) the characteristics of the VM Eligible Green Projects,
including their environmental and sustainability criteria or (iv) the suitability of the Second-Party Opinion or the
Notes to fulfill such environmental and sustainability criteria. The Initial Purchasers have not undertaken, nor are
responsible for, any assessment of the VM Eligible Green Projects, any verification of whether the VM Eligible
Green Projects meet the eligibility criteria of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework or any monitoring of the
use of proceeds. The Second-Party Opinion is not incorporated into and does not form part of this offering
memorandum.

**_Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the_**
**_offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy_**
**_related reporting requirements and other undertakings._**

Although the Joint Venture intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the
Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects, the Indenture will not include
covenants or agreements requiring the Issuer or the Joint Venture to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds
from this offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or to
satisfy the reporting and other undertakings therewith. As a result, it will not be an event of default under the
Indenture if the Joint Venture fails to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes
to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy such reporting and other
undertakings, and holders of the Notes will have no remedies under the Indenture for any such failure.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the VM Eligible Green Projects will be capable of being
implemented in or substantially in such manner and/or in accordance with any timing schedule and that
accordingly such proceeds will be totally or partially disbursed for such VM Eligible Green Projects. Nor can
there be any assurance that such VM Eligible Green Projects will be completed within any specified period or at
all or with the results or outcome as originally expected or anticipated by the Joint Venture.

The Joint Venture and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you that the VM Eligible Green Projects to which
the Joint Venture allocates amounts relating to the offering of the Notes will satisfy, or continue to satisfy,
investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance, nor can the
Joint Venture or the Initital Purchasers assure you that the VM Eligible Green Projects criteria and other aspects
of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework will satisfy, or continue to satisfy, investor criteria or expectations for
sustainable finance products. In particular, no assurance is given that the VM Eligible Green Projects will satisfy,
whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or requirements, voluntary taxonomies or
standards regarding any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required
to comply, whether by any present or future applicable laws or regulations, by its own bylaws or other governing
rules or investment portfolio mandates, ratings criteria, voluntary taxonomies or standards or other independent
expectations (in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of
any VM Eligible Green Projects or uses, the subject of or related to, the relevant VM Eligible Green Projects).
Additionally, the Joint Venture may revise the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework from time to time, and the

88


-----

criteria used by the Joint Venture to identify VM Eligible Green Projects may differ in the future. Furthermore,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify sufficient business activities qualifying as VM Eligible
Green Projects to which we could re-allocate amounts equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes if
Virgin Media no longer owns a previously-allocated Eligible Green Project or if a previously allocated VM
Eligible Green Project no longer meets the applicable criteria.

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer within the United States or to U.S. persons and may be subject_**
**_to transfer restrictions under the laws of other jurisdictions._**

The Notes offered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale. The Notes are being offered in reliance upon an exemption from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the Notes may be
transferred or resold only in a transaction registered under or exempt from, or not subject to, the U.S. Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. Please see “Transfer Restrictions”. It is the obligation of holders of the
Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Dollar Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars and the Sterling Notes will be
denominated and payable in pound sterling. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a currency
other than that of the Notes you purchase, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange-related risks,
including possible significant changes in the value of U.S. dollars or pound sterling, as applicable, relative to the
currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar or pound sterling, as applicable, against
the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the applicable Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on
such Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns. There may
be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from any investment in the Notes
and you should consult with your own tax advisors regarding any such tax consequences. See “Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant Clearing Systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in exchange for a book-entry interest in the Notes, an
owner of a book-entry interest will not be considered an owner or holder of Notes. Instead, with respect to the
Dollar Notes, a nominee of DTC, and, with respect to the Sterling Notes, a nominee of the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, will be the sole holder of the Sterling Notes.

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (as defined herein) (including principal,
premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by us to the paying agent. The paying
agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or its nominee, with respect to the Dollar Notes, or the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, with respect to the Sterling Notes, and DTC or
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures.

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from the Clearing Systems or, if applicable, from a participant therein. The Issuer cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested
actions on a timely basis.

The lack of physical certificates could also:

    - result in payment delays on your certificates because the Trustee will be sending distributions on the
certificates to the Clearing Systems instead of directly to you;

    - make it difficult for you to pledge your certificates if physical certificates are required by the party
demanding the pledge; and

    - hinder your ability to resell your certificates because some investors may be unwilling to buy
certificates that are not in physical form.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with its registered
office and principal place of business in England. It is anticipated that some or all of the directors and officers of
the Issuer will be non-residents of the United States and that all or a majority of the Issuer’s assets will be located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to enforce in the United States judgments of
U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

It is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if
proceedings were commenced in England predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See
“Enforceability of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

One or more series of the Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original issue
discount if its stated redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by at least a de minimis amount. If a
Note is treated as issued with original issue discount, U.S. investors will be subject to tax on that original issue
discount as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to that income (and in addition to
stated interest). See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_The Notes could be treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes, and in such case U.S. Holders may be subject to_**
**_adverse tax consequences._**

The Issuer expects the Notes to be treated as debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
however no assurances can be given that the Issuer’s position will not be successfully challenged by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. In such case, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) would be treated as holding equity in the Issuer. If the Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer_
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders would likely be subject to adverse tax consequences,
including those under the passive foreign investment company rules pursuant to which (i) all or a portion of any
gain on a disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain, (ii) a deferred
interest charge would apply to such gain and on certain distributions on the Notes and (iii) a U.S. Holder would
be required to comply with certain reporting requirements.

**_Employee benefit plan considerations may affect your ability to invest in the Notes._**

Each acquirer and each transferee of a Note or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and agreed at the time of its acquisition and throughout the period that it holds such Note or any
interest therein that (i) either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as such acquirer or
transferee holds such Note or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan
Investor (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”) or a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Laws (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan
_Considerations”), and no part of the assets used by it to acquire or hold any Note or any interest therein_
constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or any such governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, or (b) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit
_Plan Considerations”) and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non U.S._
plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws); and (ii) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
or any of their respective affiliates is a fiduciary (within the meaning of section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (or, with respect to a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any definition of “fiduciary” under
“Similar Laws”)) with respect to the acquirer or transferee in connection with any purchase or holding of the
Notes, or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective
affiliates of any rights in connection with the Notes, and no advice provided by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers,
the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates constitutes “investment advice” (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in connection with the Notes and the transactions
contemplated with respect to the Notes. See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations” herein for a more
detailed discussion of certain ERISA and related considerations with respect to an investment in the Notes.

**_The Volcker Rule may affect your ability to invest in the Notes._**

Section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, together with the rules, regulations
and published guidance promulgated thereunder (known as the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibits “banking
entities” from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in, sponsoring, or having

90


-----

certain relationships with, a “covered fund”, subject to certain exclusions from the definition of “covered fund”
or exemptions from the Volcker Rule’s covered fund-related prohibitions. For purposes of the Volcker Rule, a
“banking entity” is defined to include: (i) any U.S. insured depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1813), subject to certain exclusions); (ii) any company that controls a
U.S. insured depository institution; (iii) any non-U.S. company that is treated as a bank holding company for
purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (i.e., a foreign bank that maintains a branch,
agency or commercial lending office in the U.S.); and (iv) any affiliate or subsidiary of any entity described in
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (and the rules,
regulations and published guidance thereunder), other than a “covered fund” that is not itself a banking entity
under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii).

The definition of “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule includes, in part, any issuer that would be an
investment company under the 1940 Act but for the exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7)
thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on the exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be
considered a covered fund for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the
definition of “covered fund”. In the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” that are
subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership
interest” in the Issuer, unless such banking entity is able to rely on an applicable exemption under the Volcker
Rule.

“Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule as “any equity, partnership, or other similar
interest”. The Notes are not equity or partnership interests. The phrase “other similar interest” is further defined
under the Volcker Rule as an interest that:

(A) has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member
of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading
advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence
of an event of default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an
investment manager for “cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an
investment manager’s resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR
§248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2));

(B) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the
covered fund;

(C) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been
redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the
occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event);

(D) has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the
aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate
interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests);

(E) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to
the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund,
such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or
reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest;

(F) receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is
determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or

(G) any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above.

On the Issue Date, pursuant to and in accordance with the Indenture, the Trustee will be appointed to act as
trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the Security Trustee will be appointed to act as security trustee
for the creditors (including the holders of the Notes) that will benefit from the Collateral (the “CSA Secured
**Parties”). Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement,**
prior to the occurrence of a CSA Enforcement Event (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) (following the
occurrence of an Event of Default under (and as defined in the Indenture) which is continuing and the
acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture), the Issuer may continue to exercise its rights
under the Transactions Documents (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), including with respect to its
assets comprising the Collateral, and the provisions of the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents will
not otherwise afford any holder of the Notes with the right to: (i) take any corporate action or other steps or legal
proceedings for the winding-up, dissolution or reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator,
administrative receiver, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, examiner or similar officer of the Issuer or of its

91

revenues and assets; or (ii) take any steps for the purpose of obtaining payments of amounts payable to it under
the Notes, the Indenture or any Notes Security Document, or to take any steps to recover any debts whatsoever
owing to it by the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes”. These rights of the holders of the Notes to enforce the
rights and remedies granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and Notes Security
Documents are the types of rights that are excluded from the rights that are included in the definition of “other
similar interests”.

The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to participate in the selection or
removal of any of the types of partners, members or managers of the Issuer described in Clause (A) above. The
Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the JV Holdco. The holders of the Notes have no rights to participate in
the selection or removal of the Issuer’s board of directors or management.

The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to receive a share of the income,
gains or profits of the Issuer as described in Clause (B) above, and have no rights to receive the underlying assets
of the Issuer after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to
exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event) as described in Clause
(C) above. The Issuer is a financing company which, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, will be subject
to the restrictions set out in the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents. The Notes will be subject to the
Limited Recourse Restrictions (as further described in the “Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum). The only assets of the Issuer available to meet claims of the holders of the Notes and the
other CSA Secured Parties are the assets comprising the Collateral, which (as described above) cannot be
enforced prior to a CSA Enforcement Event in accordance with the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

The holders of the Notes have no rights to receive any excess spread (the positive difference, if any,
between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of Issuer and the aggregate interest
paid to the holders of the Notes) as described in Clause (D) above.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue the Notes, each series of which will bear interest at a fixed rate per
annum as further described elsewhere in this offering memorandum. While the Issuer, as a financing company, is
wholly dependent on the payments it will receive in respect of the New Finco Loans, the New Finco Facility
Accession Agreements and the applicable Related Agreements, and a failure by the VM Credit Facility Obligors
(with respect to the New Finco Loans and New Finco Facility Accession Agreements) or the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower and/or VMIH (with respect to the Related Agreements) to provide such funding may, in
practice, negatively impact the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Indenture and Notes. However,
subject to the Limited Recourse Restrictions, there are no contractual terms of the Notes under the Indenture or
the other Note Security Documents which provide that the amounts payable by the Issuer (whether as principal or
interest) with respect to the Notes will be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the Issuer
as described in Clause (E) above. Furthermore, as each series of the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, the rate of
interest on the Notes is not determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the Issuer as
described in Clause (F) above. In addition, the Issuer expects that the holders of the Notes will not receive
income on a pass-through basis from the Issuer as described in Clause (F) above, as the Issuer expects that the
holders of the Notes will hold the Notes as debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Issuer is a financing company which will depend on_
_payments under the New Finco Loans to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes” and_
“Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Issuer will not be entitled to
make any modifications to the terms of the Notes which would have the effect of reducing the principal amount
of the Notes or reducing the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on the Notes, without
the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or the
relevant series of Notes, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. See “Description of the
_Notes”._

The Indenture, the Transaction Documents and the Notes Security Document Documents do not confer upon
the holders of the Notes any synthetic rights to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses
(A) through (F) above.

On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule
released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund-related restrictions. The changes
are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the “covered funds” portion of the Volcker Rule,
including by, among other aspects, making modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition of
“covered fund”, creating certain new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund”, and making certain
clarifications to the definition of “ownership interest”. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.

92


-----

Before making an investment in the Notes, each potential investor in the Notes should consult with its own
counsel and make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether the Notes
constitute “ownership interests”, whether any exclusion or exemption under the Volcker Rule might be
applicable to an investment in the Notes by such investor, whether its investment in the Notes would be restricted
or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its investment, any
liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. See “Transfer Restrictions”. None of Virgin
Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Trustee, nor any of their respective
affiliates, makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the treatment
of the Issuer or the Notes under the Volcker Rule or to the impact of the Volcker Rule on such investor’s
investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may impact the price
and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market or restrict prospective investors’ ability to hold the Notes.
Each purchaser is responsible for analyzing its own regulatory position under the Volcker Rule and any similar
measures.

**Risks Relating to the Joint Venture Transactions**

**_The expected benefits and synergies from the Joint Venture Transactions may not materialize._**

As a result of the Joint Venture Transactions, we expect to achieve certain benefits and synergies discussed
elsewhere in this offering memorandum relating to the operations of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group.
We may not realize any or all of the anticipated synergies of the Joint Venture Transactions that we currently
anticipate. For more information regarding the synergies we expect to achieve, see “Summary—Joint Venture
_Overview”. Our estimated synergies from the Joint Venture Transactions are subject to a number of assumptions_
about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing such synergies as well as the business model of
the Joint Venture. In addition, we may be presented with significant costs and challenges in connection with the
integration of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain and are
subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competition risks and uncertainties. There can be
no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount of synergies that we
will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly from (and may be
significantly lower than) the ones that we currently estimate. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
business objectives of the Joint Venture Transactions will be achieved, particularly as the achievement of the
benefits are, in many important respects, subject to factors that we do not control, including the responses of third
parties with whom the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group enter into contracts and do business.

**_Counterparties to certain significant agreements with the Virgin Media Group and/or the O2 Group may_**
**_exercise contractual rights under such agreements in connection with the Joint Venture Transactions._**

Each of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group is party to certain agreements that give the counterparty
certain rights following a “change of control”, including in some cases the right to terminate the applicable
agreement. Under certain agreements, the Joint Venture Transactions will constitute a change of control and,
therefore, the counterparty may exercise certain rights under the applicable agreement following consummation
of the Joint Venture Transactions. Certain material contracts contain such provisions. Any such counterparty may
request modifications of their respective agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under their
agreement. There can be no assurances that such counterparties will not exercise their rights under these
agreements, including termination rights where available, or that the exercise of any such rights under, or
modification of, these agreements will not adversely affect our business or operations.

**_The integration of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group will be a significant exercise and could_**
**_adversely affect the Joint Venture’s business._**

Integrating the operations of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group may divert the Joint Venture’s
management’s attention away from other business operations. Successful integration of the Virgin Media
Group’s and the O2 Group’s operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on our
management and other internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention, and any difficulties
encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm our business, financial conditions and operating
results. In addition, we may lose employees who are instrumental for the integration and further development of
the Joint Venture, as well as customers and suppliers. Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations.

93


-----

The Joint Venture Transactions involve the integration of two groups that have previously operated
independently. Such integration may be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delay because of possible company
culture conflicts and different opinions on the Joint Venture’s strategy and operations. We may not be successful
in integrating some or all these businesses as currently anticipated, which may have a material adverse effect on
our business and operations.

**_The Joint Venture will depend on Liberty Global and Telefónica as well as third-party suppliers and licensors_**
**_to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required for the Joint Venture’s business._**

The Joint Venture will rely on the Joint Venture Parents for the continued provision of key services,
processes, resources and other assets (collectively, the “Business Services”) to support its business operations.
Material services, resources or other assets will be provided either: (i) directly to the Joint Venture by the Joint
Venture Parents (or other entities within their respective groups); or (ii) provided by third parties under
arrangements in place with the Joint Venture Parents (or other entities within their respective groups). The
continued provision of these services will be addressed by a services agreement between the Joint Venture and
each of its Joint Venture Parents. If either Joint Venture Parent (or any other service provider within their
respective groups) fails to perform its obligations under the services agreement, the Joint Venture will be
required to provide those Business Services itself or to obtain substitute arrangements with third parties. The
Joint Venture may be unable to provide the Business Service internally because of technical, financial or other
constraints and may be unable to implement substitute arrangements with third parties on a timely basis on terms
that are commercially acceptable and cost-effective. A failure by either Joint Venture Parent to provide Business
Services in accordance with the services agreement could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the
Joint Venture.

**_The Virgin Media Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the O2 Group_**
**_prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Following the Joint Venture Transactions, the_**
**_Joint Venture will prepare its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. There may be significant_**
**_differences between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP presentations of the historical financial information of the_**
**_Virgin Media Group._**

Although a preliminary assessment has been performed to determine whether material differences exist
between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP presentation of the VM Annual Combined Financial Statements and the VM
Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements, it has not been possible to finalize this assessment, nor to
perform a complete restatement of the VM Annual Combined Financial Statements and the VM Interim
Condensed Combined Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. As a result, the possibility exists that there
could be significant differences between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP presentation of the financial condition and
results of operations of the Virgin Media Group. Based on work performed to date, we believe that any such
significant differences would be limited to items that do not materially impact the debt, Segment Adjusted
EBITDA or OFCF of Virgin Media. Although we do not expect that material differences impacting the debt,
Segment Adjusted EBITDA or OFCF of the Virgin Media Group will be identified as this work progresses, no
assurance can be given that this will be the case.

**_As a result of the Joint Venture Transactions, we expect to record a significant amount of goodwill, which_**
**_could be subject to impairment._**

We expect to record substantial amounts of goodwill and intangible asset values in connection with the Joint
Venture Transactions. The intangibles will be recorded based upon our estimates of their fair values, and
goodwill will be recorded based on the excess of the amounts paid as part of the Joint Venture Transactions
based on the fair value of the Joint Venture’s net assets at the date of the respective Contributions. For the
purposes of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, an amount of £11.1 billion and £19.6 billion of intangibles and
goodwill, respectively, was recorded with respect to the Joint Venture Transactions. These amounts are
preliminary and the definitive amounts to be recorded will be determined based on the determination of the fair
value of the applicable assets on the date of the relevant Contributions. These amounts of intangibles and
goodwill may be significantly different from the preliminary amounts. See “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma
_Combined Financial Statements of JV Holdco”._

Following the recording of the fair value of the net assets contributed in connection with the Joint Venture
Transactions, we may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with the Joint Venture’s business, which may
adversely affect the anticipated returns or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the
recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets related to the Joint Venture Transactions. If

94


-----

management’s projections used in its fair value calculations change, the estimate fair value could decline
significantly and result in impairment. While impairments do not impact our measure of Segment Adjusted
EBITDA, OFCF or reported cash flows, the related non-cash charge in the income statement could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, net equity or financial condition.

**_The Pro Forma Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and cash flows of the Joint Venture would have been if the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group_**
**_were operated on a combined basis._**

The respective business operations of the Virgin Media Group and the O2 Group were operated separately
prior to the consummation of the Joint Venture Transactions. We have no history operating as a combined entity
and our operations have not previously been managed on a combined basis. Therefore, the historical financial
statements and pro forma financial information and other data presented in this offering memorandum (including
the Pro Forma Financial Statements) may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash
flows would have been had we operated on a combined basis and may not be indicative of what our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future.

Due to the recent consummation of the Joint Venture Transactions, we are currently not in a position to
measure fair values and make related adjustments to recorded values of the assets and liabilities of the Joint
Venture, as required by IFRS. However, we will make these adjustments, which will be reflected in our financial
statements following the Joint Venture Transactions.

This offering memorandum contains the Pro Forma Financial Statements. The Pro Forma Financial
Statements have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm and have not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus
Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been
prepared specifically for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions, are presented for informational purposes
only, and are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and does not purport to project
our results of operations or financial condition for any future period nor does it purport to represent what our
actual results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Joint Venture Transactions occurred
on the dates indicated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Financial Statements”
and “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements of JV Holdco”.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes are expected to be £1,124.0 million (equivalent) (after
deducting an estimated £6.2 million (equivalent) of commissions and expenses associated with the offering of the
Notes).

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with certain amounts received
under the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, will be used by the Issuer to fund the New Finco Loans to the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the VM Credit Facility. The gross proceeds of the New Finco Loans
will be used, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, to repay £1,124 million aggregate principal
amount outstanding under Facility P under the VM Credit Facility (the “Facility P Repayment”).

In accordance with the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework, the Joint Venture intends to use an amount
equal to the net proceeds of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing VM Eligible Green
Projects and to pay fees and expenses in relation thereto. Accordingly, on June 14, 2021, Sustainalytics, a
provider of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) research and analysis, evaluated the VMED O2
Green Bond Framework and certified that it aligns with the 2021 Green Bond Principles and provided views on
the robustness and credibility of the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework (which views are intended to inform
investors in general, and not for a specific investor). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
_Structure—The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to
_allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance and/or refinance new and/_
_or existing VM Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings”._

**VMED O2 Green Bond Framework**

To support Virgin Media’s Meaningful Connections Plan, the Joint Venture has established a Green Bond
Framework (the “VMED O2 Green Bond Framework”), under which the Joint Venture can issue green bonds
to finance or refinance projects, enabling the group to meet its environmental objectives. The VMED O2 Green
Bond Framework outlines the Joint Venture’s commitments with respect to any green bonds that will be issued.
The VMED O2 Green Bond Framework is aligned with the 2021 Green Bond Principles that recommend
transparency and disclosure, and promote integrity in the development of the green bond market. The SecondParty Opinion and the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework will be publicly available on our website
(www.virginmediao2.co.uk). Please note that such information and materials found on, or accessible through, our
website are not part of this offering memorandum and are not incorporated by reference herein.

The VMED O2 Green Bond Framework is presented through the following key pillars:

    - Use of Proceeds;

    - Process for Project Evaluation and Selection;

    - Management of Proceeds;

    - Reporting; and

    - External Review.

**_Use of proceeds_**

The Joint Venture will finance eligible green projects of Virgin Media (“VM Eligible Green Projects”) that
support the transition to a net zero carbon and zero waste future for its U.K. operations. Refinancing of VM
Eligible Green Projects will have a look-back period of no longer than 36 months from the time of issuance. The
net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds raised through any green bonds will be allocated to the
financing and refinancing of VM Eligible Green Projects. VM Eligible Green Projects as defined in the VMED
O2 Green Bond Framework are projects that address Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Clean Transport and
Circular Economy Adapted Products.

**_Process for Project Evaluation and Selection_**

Projects financed or refinanced through the net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of any
green bond issued under the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework will be evaluated and selected based on
compliance with the eligibility criteria set by the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework.

Virgin Media has established a “Better for the Planet” steering committee (the “Better for the Planet
**Committee”) which will oversee the selection of VM Eligible Green Projects in accordance with the eligibility**

96


-----

criteria described above. The Better for the Planet Committee is comprised of senior representatives from
relevant operational teams and supported by the Sustainability and Finance teams. It is also chaired by the Chief
Technology and Information Officer, previously a member of the Virgin Media Executive Committee and now a
member of the Joint Venture Leadership Team.

**_Management of Proceeds_**

The net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of any green bond raised under the VMED O2
Green Bond Framework will be allocated by the Joint Venture to finance or refinance VM Eligible Green
Projects, as per the VMED O2 Green Bond Framework’s eligibility criteria and the project selection process
outlined above. Such allocation will be reflected in the Joint Venture’s internal records by the use of a green
bond register. The Joint Venture intends to allocate the net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of a
green bond to finance or refinance VM Eligible Green Projects within three years from the date of issuance of
such applicable green bond. Any portion of the net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of a green
bond that has not been allocated to VM Eligible Green Projects will be managed in accordance with the Joint
Venture’s standard liquidity management practices.

**_Reporting_**

The Joint Venture will make available reports covering allocation of the net proceeds or an amount equal to
the net proceeds to the VM Eligible Green Projects and reports on the impact of the VM Eligible Green Projects.
The reporting will be made available within one year from the issuance of any green bonds and will be updated
annually until full allocation of the green bond net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds. The Initial
Purchasers do not undertake to review or monitor such reports during the life of the Notes or to advise any
investor or potential purchaser in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of any Initial Purchaser.
The reporting will be on an aggregate basis, at the level of the project portfolio. It will include:

_Allocation reporting_

    - Total amount allocated to the VM Eligible Green Projects Portfolio, reported by project category

    - Share of net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds used for financing vs. refinancing

    - Balance of unallocated proceeds

The Joint Venture intends to engage their external auditor to review the reporting of the allocation of
proceeds towards VM Eligible Green Projects.

_Impact reporting_

On a best effort basis, the Joint Venture intends to report on the environmental impacts achieved by VM
Eligible Green Projects funded by the net proceeds. The impact reporting will include a description of VM
Eligible Green Projects and impact metrics measured at the level of the overall business.

**_External Review_**

The Issuer has engaged an external verifier, Sustainalytics, to review the VMED O2 Green Bond
Framework. On June 14, 2021, Sustainalytics provided an independent Second Party Opinion on the VMED O2
Green Bond Framework’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the 2021 Green Bond Principles.

On an annual basis, an external auditor will review the allocation of proceeds towards VM Eligible Green
Projects provided in the annual allocation report.

(2) The “As Adjusted—JV Financing Transactions” amount reflects the net impact of (i) an increase in cash
related to proceeds received associated with the partial drawdown of Facility P, the full drawdown of
Facility Q and Facility R and the issuance of the Existing JV Notes, (ii) a decrease in cash of £45.8 million
associated with the upfront payment of fees and expenses in connection with the JV Financing Transactions
and (iii) a decrease in cash of £5,100.8 million related to the distribution of the remaining cash proceeds
from the JV Financing Transactions to the shareholders of the Joint Venture.
(3) The “As Adjusted—JV Financing Transactions and the issuance of the Notes and use of proceeds
therefrom” amount reflects the impact of the JV Financing Transactions and is further adjusted to reflect
(i) an increase in cash related to proceeds received associated with the issuance of the Notes, (ii) a decrease
in cash associated with the Facility P Repayment, and (iii) a decrease in cash of £6.2 million associated with
the upfront payment of fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS OF THE O2 GROUP**

_The following discussion should be read together with the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements_
_and the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as with the “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Information”, “Summary Financial and Operating Data of the O2 Group”, “Business of_
_the O2 Group”, and “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements of JV Holdco” sections_
_included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
O2 Holdings’ actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, particularly in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.

**Overview**

The O2 Group is a leading telecommunications provider and the largest mobile services providers in the
U.K (in terms of number of subscribers, according to management estimates) as of March 31, 2021, and the
second largest U.K. mobile operator in terms of mobile revenue in 2020 (including giffgaff) (source: Analysys
Mason). The O2 Group performs its activities through its operating subsidiaries in the U.K. which are:

    - Telefonica UK Limited, a MNO trading in the U.K. under the brand name “O2”, providing mobile
telecommunications and related services to a growing customer base; and

    - giffgaff Limited (“giffgaff”), a MVNO operating on the O2 network.

The principal activity of the O2 Group is the operation of a cellular communications network using
spectrum held under licenses granted to provide mobile communications services to its customers under the “O2”
and “giffgaff” brands.

The O2 Group has only one reportable segment, which is the mobile telecommunications business in the
U.K. The mobile telecommunications segment derives revenue from the operation of a cellular communications
network, and the sale of mobile and data services to the O2 Group’s customer base.

For a more detailed description of the business of the O2 Group, see “Business of the O2 Group” included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of the O2 Group’s Financial Condition and Results of**
**Operations**

The following factors affect the comparability of the O2 Group’s results of operations in the periods under
review:

**_IFRS 16 (Leases)_**

On January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases) (“IFRS 16”) became effective. Its implementation had a material
impact on the consolidated results of the O2 Group. The impact of IFRS 16 for the year ended December 31,
2019, was an increase of £707 million in total assets and total liabilities. In addition, as a result of the adoption of
IFRS 16, most lease expenses that under the prior accounting standard affected operating expenses now affect
depreciation and amortization or net financial costs, resulting in higher OIBDA and higher operating profit, and
are not directly comparable with lease expenses in periods prior to the adoption of IFRS 16. The adoption of
IFRS 16 had no impact on revenue growth, while it had a 12.0% positive impact on OIBDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared with the year ended December 31, 2018.

For certain explanations in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations of the O2 Group”, the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 has been excluded in order to facilitate_
year-on-year comparison. The O2 Group believes that variations excluding the impact of IFRS 16 provide
valuable supplemental information regarding the O2 Group’s results of operations. However, these variations
may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are not intended to be a substitute for changes
in reported amounts presented in conformity with IFRS and should not be viewed in isolation.

For additional information on the impact of IFRS 16, see note 2 to the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Factors Affecting the O2 Group’s Historical and Future Results of Operations**

**_Operating environment_**

The O2 Group’s results of operations are dependent, to a large extent, on the level of demand for its services
in the market in which the O2 Group operates. Traditionally, demand for services is affected by the performance
of the mobile telecommunications market in the U.K. and its economy, particularly household private
consumption, but also gross domestic product, inflation, or consumer price index, external accounts and
unemployment rates. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, however, could significantly affect demand for the O2
Group’s services.

**_COVID-19_**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommunications has played a critical role keeping people connected.
As a result, the O2 Group has maximized some elements of its network capacity, enabling essential connectivity,
to support the U.K.’s productivity. The O2 Group’s network has been carrying up to 48% additional voice traffic
at the busiest point of the day. At its peak, the increase was comparable to six years of regular year- on-year
growth. The O2 Group doubled the capacity of its voice network, through reconfiguration of network equipment
in certain areas, to accommodate this increase and continues to actively monitor the network to maintain voice
and data connectivity for all customers.

The O2 Group has also followed U.K. Government advice to help protect its employees and customers. The
O2 Group immediately implemented business continuity plans to allow office-based employees to work from
home and closed all retail locations after trading on March 23, 2020, ahead of the first national lockdown
announcement by the U.K. Government. Since the initial lockdown period, the O2 Group has implemented a
work from home policy where possible to do so ensuring the safety and welfare of its employees and the ability
to continue to meet the needs of customers. In addition, the O2 Group introduced a range of temporary measures
to assist its employees (including retail employees), including the protection of base pay for all employees, paid
leave for vulnerable employees and for those in self-isolation, or with caring responsibilities who are unable to
work from home.

The O2 Group worked closely with the government to provide assistance to the U.K. National Health
Services (“NHS”) workers, charities and our customers by providing 25% discount on tariffs and free data for
NHS workers, unlimited free calls for contract customers, suspended roaming charges, support for vulnerable
customers and zero-rating access to support and charity websites. The O2 Group also provided access to the O2
Arena to the NHS free of charge as a training facility for staff at the London NHS Nightingale hospital and
delivered connectivity to over 1,600 NHS vaccine centres.

Following the phased easing of lockdown restrictions, the O2 Group remains committed to ensuring the
continuing safety of its employees and customers and have re-engineered its retail locations, practices and
procedures to align with the government guidelines for social distancing. The O2 Group’s corporate offices and
sites have also re-opened in line with Governmental and local health and safety guidelines. The O2 Group is
mindful of the economic pressure and impact on profitability growth and is committed to helping the U.K. return
to normalcy by supporting customers and businesses.

**_Foreign exchange rates_**

The O2 Group’s functional and presentation currency is the pound sterling, which is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the O2 Group operates. The O2 Group is exposed to non-material
transactional foreign exchange risks arising from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the euro
and U.S. dollar that could affect its results and financial position.

To minimize the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, the O2 Group utilizes hedging instruments made
available to them by the Telefónica Group and has established a set of policies, including the use of derivatives,
primarily exchange rates hedging instruments. The O2 Group utilizes foreign exchange rate hedging instruments
to hedge foreign exchange rate exposure principally in respect of euro and U.S. dollar payments with regard to
roaming agreements and not for speculative purposes.

102


-----

**_Taxation_**

The O2 Group is subject to taxation. The charge for tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for
items which are non-assessable or disallowed.

As of March 31, 2021, deferred tax assets amounted to £4 million and deferred tax liabilities amounted to
£70 million. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 deferred tax assets amounted to £4 million, £7 million
and zero, respectively, while deferred tax liabilities amounted to £58 million, £52 million and £37 million,
respectively.

Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right of
offset and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

(1) Following the introduction of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (“IFRS 15”), the O2
Group no longer reports “Mobile service revenue”, because it no longer believes that “Mobile service
revenue” is an accurate measure of its revenue, as that metric is disproportionately impacted by the
existence of its “O2 Refresh” proposition contracts and ongoing channel strategy. In addition, the O2 Group
believes that the presentation of “Mobile service revenue” is also not in line with its competitors in the
industry.
(2) Prepaid percentage is calculated by dividing the number of prepaid mobile accesses at the period end by the
total number of mobile accesses at the period end.
(3) Contract percentage is calculated by dividing the number of contract mobile accesses at the period end by
the total number of mobile accesses at the period end.
(4) Since March 2020, IoT accesses have been reported separately within Mobile accesses and are no longer
reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 and the comparative period for 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect this new
reporting. IoT accesses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in total Contract
accesses.

_For further information regarding the O2 Group’s main key performance indicators, see “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures” and “—Special Note Regarding Non-IFRS_
_Measures”._

**_Revenue_**

Revenue, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises mobile business, consisting of
mobiles revenues and handset revenues, and fixed business (each as described in more detail below). Mobile and
fixed revenues may be sold separately or bundled in promotional packages. Total package revenues are allocated
among the identified performance obligations based on their respective standalone selling prices.

    - **_Mobile business revenues include mobile business revenues and handset revenues and refer to_**
revenues derived from telecommunications services provided to the customers through the O2 Group’s
mobile voice and data services, both in the prepaid and postpaid segment. Mobile business revenue
includes revenue earned for usage of the O2 Group’s wireless network for voice, text message and data
transmission by the O2 Group’s customers, subscription fees (including those earned from the O2
Group’s MVNO partners), inbound roaming (earned from foreign mobile operators whose customers
roam onto the O2 Group’s network), outbound roaming (earned from the O2 Group’s customers
roaming outside their domestic coverage area) and interconnect revenue (earned from other
telecommunication operators whose customers terminate calls on the O2 Group’s network). Handset
revenue principally consists of revenue from the sale of mobile devices, including smartphones and
other mobile handsets sold through the O2 Group’s direct distribution channels under the “O2 Refresh”
proposition (where hardware is recognized as a separate performance obligation and deliverable to
airtime), as well as the sale of tablets, smart-tech (for example, smart watches and fitness devices) and
accessories (for example, mobile phone cases, screen protectors, chargers, cables, portable batteries,
headphones and speakers). Handset revenue is recognized when the products are delivered to the
customer. Handset billing will typically include an upfront amount and the remaining payments are
spread over the contract term. Where the implied financing element of these payments is significant
when compared with the other performance obligations in the contract, a portion of the revenue is
allocated to significant financing and is charged to the profit and loss statement as interest costs over
the term of the contract. Mobile business revenues also includes the O2 Group’s Smart Metering
Implementation Program (“SMIP”) contract.

    - **_Fixed business revenues include information and communication technology revenues provided to_**
business customers and associated with the provision of complete connectivity, whether through fixedline, Wi-Fi or mobile technology. Solutions (apps, tools and services) are provided encompassing
connectivity, productivity and security.

**_Average Revenue per User (“O2 ARPU”)_**

Average revenue per user for the O2 Group is calculated as total revenue less inbound roaming revenue,
MVNO revenue, wholesale discounts, hardware revenue and non-mobile revenue divided by the average of the
monthly average accesses for the period.

**_OIBDA and OIBDA Margin_**

OIBDA is calculated by excluding depreciation and amortization from operating profit. OIBDA Margin is
OIBDA calculated as a percentage of revenue. See “—Special Note Regarding Non-IFRS Measures”.

**_Capital expenditures (“CapEx”)_**

CapEx includes spectrum acquisitions (additions of spectrum included in intangible assets), additions to
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

**_OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDA – CapEx Margin_**

OIBDA-CapEx is calculated as OIBDA minus CapEx. OIBDA-CapEx Margin is OIBDA-CapEx calculated
as a percentage of revenue. See “—Special Note Regarding Non-IFRS Measures”.

104


-----

**_Mobile accesses_**

Mobile accesses include accesses to the mobile network for voice and/or data services (including
connectivity). Mobile accesses are divided into three different categories: Prepaid accesses, Contract accesses
and, since March 2020, Internet of Things (“IoT”) accesses. IoT accesses for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2021 and the comparative period for 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, are reported
separately from Contract accesses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, IoT accesses are reported
within Contract accesses.

**_Wholesale accesses_**

Wholesale accesses are provided by the O2 Group directly to third parties who then deliver services over
such accesses to both consumer and corporate clients.

**_Total accesses_**

Total accesses are the number of connections on the O2 network, including giffgaff, Tesco Mobile Limited
(“Tesco Mobile”), Sky Mobile, Lycamobile and other MVNO partners.

**Special Note Regarding Non-IFRS Measures**

The O2 Group’s management believes that, in addition to the financial information expressly defined under
IFRS, there are measures that provide information useful to assess the O2 Group’s performance. These measures
should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for the measures presented according to IFRS. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

The following non-IFRS alternative performance measures of the O2 Group are presented in this offering
memorandum: OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, CapEx, OIBDA-CapEx, OIBDA-CapEx Margin and Net debt. Such
measures are presented in order to show the underlying business performance and to enhance comparability
between reporting periods. By facilitating comparisons of relative performance, the measures aid management to
detect and evaluate trends, to forecast operating and financial performance and to compare actual performance to
forecast expectations. The O2 Group uses these measures as internal measures to evaluate and compare its
performance. For these reasons, the O2 Group believes measures based on OIBDA and other non-financial
measures are regularly used by investors as a means of comparing companies in its industry.

However, the non-IFRS alternative performance measures of the O2 Group presented in this offering
memorandum are not defined under IFRS, and different companies and analysts may calculate them differently,
thus comparisons among companies on this basis should be made carefully. They are not measures of
performance under IFRS and have not been audited or reviewed, should not be considered in isolation, do not
represent the O2 Group’s revenue, margins, results of operations or cash flow for the periods indicated and
should not be regarded as alternatives to revenue, cash flow or profit for the period or other measures of
performance as defined by IFRS.

The non-IFRS alternative performance measures of the O2 Group presented in this offering memorandum
include figures derived from the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the O2 Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements through aggregation, subtraction or division.

The comparability of these measures throughout the periods under review is also affected by the impact of
adopting IFRS 16 in 2019. See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of the O2 Group’s Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations”._

**_Definitions and Reconciliations_**

_OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDA-CapEx Margin_

The O2 Group measures its performance by the OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDACapEx Margin and uses these metrics to make decisions about allocating resources to evaluate its financial
performance and to establish operating and strategic targets of O2 Group companies. OIBDA is a commonly
reported measure and is widely used among analysts, investors and other stakeholders in the telecommunications
industry.

105


-----

OIBDA is calculated by excluding depreciation and amortization from operating profit. OIBDA Margin is
OIBDA calculated as a percentage of revenue. However, OIBDA is not a measure expressly defined under IFRS
and therefore it may not be comparable to similar indicators used by other companies. OIBDA should not be
considered as a substitute for operating profit.

The O2 Group believes that it is important to consider CapEx, together with OIBDA in order to have a more
complete measure of the performance of its telecommunications businesses. The O2 Group believes that
considering CapEx together with OIBDA provides useful information regarding both its performance during the
year as well as the investments the O2 Group made during such year in order to support its business going
forward. Therefore, the O2 Group uses these measures internally to track the performance of its business, to
establish operating and strategic targets of the businesses of the O2 Group and in its internal budgeting process.

In addition, the O2 Group believes that these measures provide useful information to investors and other
stakeholders to allow them to better compare performance across telecommunications companies with business
models that differ based on whether they obtain network access, IT and other infrastructure services by paying
fees that would be reflected in OIBDA through the development of owned networks and infrastructures that
would be reflected in CapEx. Furthermore, similar metrics are reported externally by other telecommunications
companies, and investors and analysts often track and compare these measures across different
telecommunications companies.

The following table provides a reconciliation of OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, OIBDA-CapEx and OIBDACapEx Margin to the O2 Group’s operating profit for the referenced periods.

_Net debt_

The O2 Group calculates Net debt by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings.

The O2 Group believes that Net debt is meaningful for investors and analysts because it provides solvency
information with respect to the O2 Group. The O2 Group uses it to calculate internally certain solvency and
leverage ratios. However, Net debt should not be considered as a substitute for total borrowings as presented in
the consolidated statement of financial position of the O2 Group.

**Revenue amounted to £1,356 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of 9.5%**
compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly driven by stores being
closed for the first three months of the year in 2021 due to COVID-19, compared to only two weeks of closure
during the first quarter of 2020, negatively affecting handset sales, although this was partially offset by an
increase in online trading.

2021, compared to £1,445 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of
9.6%. This decrease was primarily due to the closure of stores during the three months ended
March 31, 2021 compared to only two weeks of closure during the three months ended March 31, 2020
due to COVID-19 lockdowns. This negatively affected handset sales, but was, however, partially offset
by an increase in online trading. Handset revenue amounted to £323 million for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2021, compared to £369 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, a
decrease of 12.5%. This decrease was primarily due to COVID-19 related store closures during the
three months ended March 31, 2021 mentioned above.

    - **Fixed business revenue amounted to £49 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021,**
compared to £53 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of 7.5%. This

(1) Since March 2020, IoT accesses have been reported separately within Mobile accesses and are no longer
reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 and the comparative period for 2020 reflect this new reporting.

**Total accesses amounted to 36,562.7 thousand for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, compared**
to 34,797.4 thousand for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, a 5.1% increase.

**Mobile accesses increased by 1,189 thousand, or 4.6%, from 26,023.2 thousand for the three-month period**
ended March 31, 2020 to 27,212.2 thousand for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily driven by the continuing roll out of the SMIP.

**Prepaid accesses registered a 124 thousand accesses decline for the three-month period ended March 31,**
2021, or a 1.5% decrease, compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was in line

**Revenue amounted to £5,962 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to £6,235 million**
for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 4.4%. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced roaming
revenues and other COVID-19 impacts, and was partially offset by increased handset and wholesale revenue.

    - **Mobile business revenue amounted to £5,756 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared**
to £6,044 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 4.8%. This decrease was mainly
due to travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, which had a corresponding negative impact on roaming
revenues. Handset revenue amounted to £1,614 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared
to £1,575 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2%. This increase reflected both

£191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 7.6%. This increase was primarily
driven by non-mobile ICT business growth.

**Operating costs amounted to £5,006 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to**
£5,262 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 4.9%. This decrease was mainly due to
commissions savings, resulting from enhanced direct trading by the O2 Group resulting in less commissions
payable to third-parties, and strong cost control.

**Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets amounted to £164 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2020 compared to £149 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 10.1%. This
increase was mainly due to increased impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets.

**OIBDA amounted to £1,795 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to £1,805 million for**
the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 0.6%. This decrease was mainly due to COVID-19 related
negative impacts on revenue partially mitigated by commissions savings and strong cost control.

reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the year ended December 31, 2020,
reflect this new reporting and IoT accesses for the year ended December 31, 2019 are included in total
Contract accesses.

**Total accesses amounted to 36,191.5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to**
34,518.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 4.8%.

December 31, 2019 to 26,980.7 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
driven by the continuing roll-out of the SMIP. Contract accesses also increased 8.6% despite the expiry of our
consumer trading relationship with Dixons Carphone, a leading U.K. independent specialist mobile retailer, at the
beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and the impact of additional lockdowns as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

**Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018**

This section includes discussions of variations, on a consolidated basis, in the O2 Group’s consolidated
income statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Reported year-on-year variations of line items included in the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements
reflect the adoption of IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019 (with results for the year ended December 31, 2018, being
reported in accordance with IAS 17). For certain explanations in this “—Comparison of the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018”, the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 has been excluded in order to facilitate
year-on-year comparison. The O2 Group believes that variations excluding the impact of IFRS 16 provide valuable
supplemental information regarding the O2 Group’s results of operations. However, these variations may differ
from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are not intended to be a substitute for changes in reported
amounts presented in conformity with IFRS and should not be viewed in isolation. See “—Key Factors Affecting
_the Comparability of the O2 Group’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations—IFRS 16 (Leases)”._

**Revenue amounted to £6,235 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to £6,007 million**
for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 3.8%. This increase was mainly driven by online channel
sales growth as well as increased higher-value handset revenue due to the full year impact of the O2 Group’s
“Custom Plans”, which enable customers to spread the cost of their phones over different terms, flex their data up
and down and upgrade whenever they like. “Custom Plans” was launched in September 2018. In addition, there
was continued growth in SMIP, as well as increased MVNO revenue over the period. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in roaming revenue over the period.

    - **Mobile business revenue amounted to £6,044 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,**
compared to £5,816 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 3.9%. This increase
was mainly due to continued MVNO growth and associated revenue increases. Handset revenue
amounted to £1,575 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to £1,374 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 14.6%. This increase was due to increasing handset
revenues resulting from the full year impact of the O2 Group’s “Custom Plans” (as described above)
which launched in September 2018 and continued growth from SMIP.

    - **Fixed business revenue were stable year on year and amounted to £191.4 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to £191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of
0.2%.

**Operating costs amounted to £5,262 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to**
£5,134 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 2.5%. This increase was mainly due to the
increase in right of use asset depreciation due to the first application of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, partially
offset by a reduction in operating lease rentals. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, operating costs amounted to
£5,272 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2.7% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018, mainly due to the increase in property, plant and equipment depreciation due and to higher
Annual License Fee payments related to spectrum license costs for telecommunication activities for 3G, 4G and
5G (3.4GHz ) services provided since February 2019 (during the year ended December 31, 2019 amortization of
the 5G (3.4Ghz) spectrum started from October when the license was placed in service), partially offset by a
reduction in costs associated with reduced roaming.

**Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets amounted to £149 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2019 compared to £89 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 67.4%. This
increase was mainly due to a £49 million increase related to an increase in the cost of selling rate of receivables
related to the “O2 Refresh” proposition.

**OIBDA amounted to £1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to £1,605 million for**
the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 12.5%. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, OIBDA amounted to
£1,613 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to £1,605 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, an increase of 0.5% mainly due to the increase in the O2 Group’s revenue, which was
proportionally higher than the related increase in operating costs.

**OIBDA Margin, including the impact of IFRS 16, increased by 2.2% to 28.9% for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Operating profit, including the impact of IFRS 16, amounted to £824 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to £784 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 5.1%. This
increase was due to the increase in hardware and other revenue despite the related increase of right of use asset
depreciation. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, operating profit increased by 3.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Taxation expense, including the impact of IFRS 16, amounted to £168 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to £137 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased operating
profits for the period.

**CapEx, including the impact of IFRS 16, amounted to £945 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,**
compared to £1,335 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
_Capital Expenditures” for further discussion of the O2 Group’s CapEx during the period._

**OIBDA-CapEx, including the impact of IFRS 16, amounted to £860 million for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to £270 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly
due to lower CapEx during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018,
as well as due to the increase in OIBDA explained above.

**OIBDA-CapEx Margin, including the impact of IFRS 16, increased by 9.3% to 13.8% for the year ended**
December 31, 2019, compared to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**_Key performance indicators_**

(1) Since March 2020, IoT accesses have been reported separately within Mobile accesses and are no longer
reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018 are included in total Contract accesses.

During 2019, the O2 Group successfully introduced its first offer for customers seeking unlimited mobile
data while providing upselling opportunities and continued to offer successful commercial propositions such as
the “Custom Plans” offering and its updates. Such propositions allowed the O2 Group to achieve continuous
customer growth despite operating in a competitive market.

**Total accesses amounted to 34,518.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to**
32,643.3 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 5.7%.

**Mobile accesses increased by 759.2 thousand, or 3.0%, from 25,044.1 thousand for the year ended**
December 31, 2018 to 25,803.3 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. These mobile accesses net
additions were driven by contract mobile accesses, which grew by 6.5% to 17,367.2 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase resulted in contract mobile accesses representing an increased proportion of
the O2 Group’s total mobile accesses of 67.3%. The growth in contract mobile accesses was partially offset by
the decrease in prepaid mobile accesses of 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018, to 8,436.1 thousand, due to general market trends where customers are increasingly
migrating to pay-monthly contract services.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

The O2 Group’s main sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations (see “—Consolidated
_Statement of Cash Flows”), funds from financings related parties (ultimately from the Telefónica Group in the_
form of loans or contributions), proceeds in the form of distributions or loans from our subsidiaries and capital
contributions. The O2 Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the O2 Group’s ability to
continue to operate as a going concern, to maintain optimal capital structure commensurate with risk and return
and to reduce the cost of capital.

The O2 Group’s principal liquidity and capital resources requirements consist of the following:

    - costs and expenses relating to the operation of the business, including taxation expenses;

    - capital expenditures, which are mainly intended to improve the O2 Group’s network;

    - acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and spectrum;

    - intra-group loan service requirements relating to the existing and future loan;

    - payments of dividends and shareholder remuneration;

    - acquisitions and investment opportunities;

    - distributions or loans to giffgaff, Tesco Mobile or other subsidiaries of the O2 Group; and

    - any other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time.

Cash flows from operations are the primary source of cash funding for existing operations, capital
expenditures, investments, licenses, interest obligations and principal payments, as well as capital increases. The
O2 Group general financial policy consists in managing its liquidity to ensure that funds required for future
obligations are available from cash or from the sources listed above to settle liabilities as they become due.

For the amortization schedule of current and non-current financial liabilities, see “—Financing” below.

**_Borrowings_**

Non-current borrowings remained at £964 million as of March 31, 2021, compared to £964 million as of
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Current borrowings increased to £448 million as of March 31, 2021. The
total amount of borrowings for the period corresponds to amounts owed to other related parties under intra-group
loans or facilities with Telfin Ireland and Telfisa Global BV (each a Telefónica Group company) (the “Intra**Group Loans”).**

As of March 31, 2021, the main features of the Intra-Group Loans were as follows:

    - a facility to assist with the acquisition of 20 MHz of paired 700 MHz FDD spectrum and 40 MHz of
3.6 - 3.8 GHz spectrum which has an interest rate based on LIBOR plus 45 basis points up until
June 30, 2021. The maturity date of this loan is June 30, 2021.

    - a loan to assist with the acquisition of 800MHz 4G spectrum which had an interest rate based on
LIBOR plus 272 basis points up until June 30, 2018 and LIBOR plus 105 basis points from July 1,
2018 and is calculated on a quarterly basis. The maturity date of this loan is June 30, 2023.

    - a loan to assist with the acquisition of 2.3GHz 4G and 3.4GHz 5G spectrum which has an interest rate
based on LIBOR plus 90 basis points and is calculated on a quarterly basis. The maturity date of this
loan is June 30, 2022.

The Intra-Group Loans were repaid in connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture Transactions.

For further detail regarding cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and for
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 see note 25 to the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and note 30 to the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Operating Activities_

Net cash inflow from operating activities was £506 million for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021, compared to £247 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in trade and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in trade and other payables.

Net cash inflow from operating activities was £1,438 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
compared to £1,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in trade and other payables, partially offset by an increase in net financial expenses.

Net cash inflow from operating activities was £1,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to £1,359 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the increase
of operating cash flow before working capital variation as a result of the increase in profit before taxes, partially
offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables, an increase in contributions to retirement benefit obligation
and an increase in income taxes to be paid.

_Investing Activities_

Net cash outflow from investing activities was £596 million for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021, compared to £220 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to a one-time spectrum acquisition.

Net cash outflow from investing activities was £896 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
compared to £939 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in capital expenditure reflecting investment program flexibility, partially offset by the impact of increased 5G
investments.

Net cash outflow from investing activities was £939 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to £1,337 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to the one-off
purchase of spectrum licenses in 2018 not repeated in 2019.

-----

_Financing Activities_

Net cash flow from financing activities was £394 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021,
compared to net cash outflow of £45 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily due to new current borrowings under the Intra-Group Loans to finance the spectrum acquisition.

Net cash outflow from financing activities was £683 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
compared to £749 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in principal elements of lease payments.

Net cash outflow from financing activities was £749 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to a £121 million inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly attributable
to a decrease in repayments of borrowings as well as the increase in principal elements of lease payments,
partially offset by the significant increase in dividends paid and the complete disposal in proceeds from
borrowings compared to 2018.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Capital expenditures include amounts invested for purchasing long-lived assets used in the O2 Group’s
business. Capital expenditures are capitalized as either property, plant and equipment or as intangible assets. The
following table summarizes the O2 Group’s capital expenditures for the periods indicated.

**Three-month period ended March 31,** **Year ended December 31,**
**2021** **2020** **2020** **2019** **2018**
**(millions of pounds)**
**CapEx . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **987** **213** **927** **945** **1,335**
_Spectrum acquisitions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _448_ _—_ _84_ _—_ _524_

Capital expenditures increased by £774 million, or 363%, from £213 million for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2020 to £987 million for the same period in 2021. This increase was due to the impact of the
aforementioned spectrum acquisition and reassessment of certain leases during the three months ended March 31,
2021.

Capital expenditures decreased by £18 million, or 1.9%, from £945 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to £927 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily a reflection of investment
program flexibility offset by increased levels of investment in growth areas such as 5G

Capital expenditures decreased by £390 million, or 29.2%, from £1,335 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to £945 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to
the one-off impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2018 offset by the introduction of right of use accounting
following the adoption of IFRS 16.

**Capital Commitments and contingent liabilities**

The O2 Group had the following contractual commitment obligations as of March 31, 2021:

**2021** **2022** **2023** **2024** **2025** **Thereafter** **Total**
**(in millions of pounds)**
Tangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 66 0 0 0 0 0 66

The O2 Group has no contingent liabilities or guarantees on which material losses are expected. The O2
Group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal
liabilities arising in the course of its operations.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of March 31, 2021, the O2 Group had no off-balance sheet transactions or obligations related to contracts
and purchase commitments corresponding to business development.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk**

The O2 Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign currency risk, interest
rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The principal market financial risks of the O2 Group and how the O2
Group manages these risks are discussed below.

**_Foreign currency risk_**

The O2 Group operates mainly in the U.K. but is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risks arising
from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the euro and U.S. dollar that can affect its results
and financial position. The O2 Group believes that the impact of any reasonable change in foreign exchange rates
would not have a significant impact on the results of the O2 Group.

The O2 Group also has a small amount of transactional foreign currency risk exposure. Such exposure arises
from revenues and purchases by an operating unit that is in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency.
Significant exposures are managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and the Telefónica Group
managing positions on a Telefónica Group wide basis.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

The O2 Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the effects of movements in interest rates on the
value of the O2 Group’s long-term borrowings and interest received on cash and cash equivalents. The O2
Group’s long-term borrowings and other financial assets are at fixed interest rates. The majority of the O2
Group’s cash and cash equivalents are deposited with a central Telefónica Group company that pays interest at
variable market rates.

The O2 Group believes that the impact of any reasonable change in interest rates would not have a
significant impact on the result of the O2 Group for the year.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with
financial liabilities as they fall due.

Management of the O2 Group’s liquidity risk is achieved mostly through being a part of the larger
Telefónica Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in this area. The O2 Group holds financial
assets primarily in short-term deposits with a central Telefónica Group company that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash. These measures help keep liquidity risk low.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

The O2 Group’s principal credit risks are attributable to its trade receivables and contract assets. Trade
receivables as presented in the statement of financial position are net of provision for doubtful debts, estimated
by the O2 Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic
environment. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing
basis. At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. The O2 Group
does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.

For a more detailed description on quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks see note 34 to
the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the O2 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the O2 Group’s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain or where judgments,
assumptions and estimates are significant. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other
assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these
judgments, assumptions and estimates are made. The O2 Group continually evaluates its judgments, estimates
and assumptions. Its actual results may differ from the judgments, assumptions and estimates made by the
management. To the extent that there are material differences between these judgments, assumptions and
estimates (on the one hand) and actual results (on the other hand), its future financial statement presentation,
financial condition, results of operation and cash flows may be affected. In order to provide an understanding
regarding the manner in which the management forms its judgments about future events, including the variables
underlying the judgments, estimates and assumptions, the O2 Group summarizes its main critical accounting
policies below relating to:

    - property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill;

    - deferred income taxes.

    - provisions;

    - revenue recognition; and

    - leases (IFRS 16).

See note 3 to the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and note 3 to the O2 Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the O2 Group’s accounting policies.

**_Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill_**

_Property, plant and equipment_

The accounting treatment of investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets entails the
use of estimates to determine the useful life for depreciation and amortization purposes. The O2 Group believes
that the estimates it makes to determine an asset’s useful life are “critical accounting estimates” because they
require the management to make estimates about technological evolution and competitive uses of assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives are depreciated or amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortized, but are, instead, subject to an impairment test on a yearly basis and whenever there is an indication
that such assets may be impaired. When the O2 Group estimates useful lives, various factors are considered
including expected technological obsolescence and the expected period of use of the asset. Management regularly
reviews these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect the estimated current remaining lives in light of
technological changes, future economic utilization and physical condition of the assets concerned. A significant
change in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation and amortization charges for the period.

The decision to recognize an impairment loss involves developing estimates that include, among others, an
analysis of the causes of the potential impairment, its timing and expected amount, which requires the estimation
of future cash flows, discount rates and the fair value of the assets. Specifically, management shall make certain
assumptions in respect of uncertain matters, such as growth in revenues, changes in market prices, operating
margins, and technology developments and obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other changes in
circumstances that indicate the need to perform an impairment test. The determination of whether the impairment
of these assets is necessary involves the use of estimates that includes, but is not limited to, the analysis of the
cause of potential impairment in value, the timing of such potential impairment and an estimate of the amount of
the impairment. The O2 Group considers technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other
changes in circumstances as indications of the need to perform an impairment test.

Goodwill arises when the cost of a business combination exceeds the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but
is, instead, subject to an impairment test on a yearly basis and whenever there is an indication that the goodwill
may be impaired.

Non-scheduled write-downs of goodwill are made when an impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill
occurs. The O2 Group reviews, on a regular basis, the performance of its cash-generating units. The O2 Group
compares the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated with its
recoverable amount. The determination of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit involves extensive
use of estimates and significant management judgment is involved. Methods commonly used by us for valuations
include discounted cash flow methods. Management makes assumptions including, but not limited to, the
discount rate to be applied, future technological evolution and revenue growth rates in calculating expected cash
flow. See note 7 to the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

A significant change in the facts and circumstances that the O2 Group relied upon in making its estimates
may have a material impact on its operating results and financial condition.

**_Deferred income taxes_**

The O2 Group assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on estimates of future earnings, and of
all the options available to achieve an outcome, it considers the most efficient one in tax terms within the legal
framework O2 Group is subject to. Such recoverability ultimately depends on its ability to generate taxable
earnings over the period for which the deferred tax assets remain available. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable future
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. This analysis is
based on the estimated schedule for reversing deferred tax liabilities, as well as estimates of taxable earnings,
which are sourced from internal projections that are continuously updated to reflect the latest trends.

The recognition of tax assets and liabilities depends on a series of factors, including estimates as to the
timing and realization of deferred tax assets and the projected tax payment schedule. Actual O2 Group company
income tax receipts and payments could differ from the estimates made by the O2 Group as a result of changes in
tax legislation, the outcome of underway tax proceedings or unforeseen future transactions that could affect tax
balances.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recorded when, at the end of the period, the O2 Group has a present obligation as a result of
past events, whose settlement requires an outflow of resources that is considered probable and can be measured
reliably. This obligation may be legal or constructive, arising from, but not limited to, regulation, contracts,
common practice or public commitments, which have created a valid expectation for third parties that the O2
Group will assume certain responsibilities. The amount recorded is the best estimation performed by the
management in respect of the expenditure that will be required to settle the obligations, considering all the
information available at the closing date, including the advice of external experts, such as legal advisors or
consultants.

Should the O2 Group be unable to reliably measure the obligation, no provision would be recorded and
information would then be presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Because of the
inherent uncertainties in this estimation, actual expenditures may be different from the originally estimated
amount recognized.

Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of provisions, actual outflows
of resources may differ from the amounts recognized originally on the basis of the estimates.

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises mobile business revenue and
fixed business revenues. See “—Key Performance Indicators of the O2 Group—Revenue”.

Under IFRS 15, for bundled packages that combine mobile services and hardware services, the total revenue
is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone selling prices in relation to the total

119


-----

consideration of the package and is recognized when (or as) the obligation is satisfied, regardless of whether
there are undelivered items. Consequently, when bundles include a price difference on equipment, the adoption
of these new requirements results in an increase of revenues recognized from the sale of handsets and other
equipment, generally recognized upon delivery to the end customer, offset by a reduction of ongoing service
revenue over subsequent periods. To the extent that the packages are marketed at a price difference, the
difference between the revenue from the sale of equipment and the consideration received from the customer
upfront is recognized as a contract asset on the statement of financial position and amortized over the term of the
contract.

Under IAS 18 Revenue, which was the revenue standard adopted in the year ended December 31, 2017,
prior to the adoption of IFRS 15, the portion of the total consideration that was contingent upon delivery of
undelivered elements was not allocated to delivered elements.

IFRS 15 requires the recognition of an asset for those incremental costs (sales commissions and other thirdparty acquisition costs) directly related to obtaining a contract and that are expected to be recovered. These are
subsequently amortized over the same period as the revenue associated with such asset. Costs to obtain a contract
are expensed when incurred if the O2 Group estimates that their amortization period is one year or less.

**_Leases (IFRS 16)_**

Accounting for rights and obligations as a lessee under a lease contract requires the use of estimations to
determine the lease term in contracts that include extension options or early termination options.

Determining the lease term involves making estimates over the time horizon of the O2 Group’s strategic
planning process with respect to relevant factors such as expected technological progress, possible regulatory
developments, market and competition trends or changes in the business model. The assumptions regarding these
variables involve a significant degree of judgment to the extent that the timing and nature of future changes are
difficult to anticipate.

Due to the uncertainties inherent to these estimates, changes in the assumptions made in respect of uncertain
matters when determining the lease term of a lease contract may have an impact on the amounts of the right of
use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the basis of the estimates made by the O2 Group.

**BUSINESS OF THE O2 GROUP**

**Introduction**

The O2 Group is a leading U.K. MNO whose primary business is providing mobile telecommunications and
related services with approximately 36.6 million mobile accesses (including wholesale mobile accesses) as of
March 31, 2021.

Under its premium O2 brand, the O2 Group offers a comprehensive range of mobile services and products
to consumer and business customers, including mobile voice, messaging and data services, and sales of handsets,
tablets, wearable devices and other hardware. In addition, the O2 Group offers a wide range of value-add services
and products including Wi-Fi services, security services, cloud services, digital payment services, certain fixedline services for businesses and insurance products. The O2 Group has also developed innovative value-add
services and products, including services and products relating to the Internet of Things (“IoT”), insurance, and
big-data and insight services for businesses. Through its digital loyalty program, Priority, the O2 Group offers its
customers a range of exclusive deals and perks.

In addition to its offerings under its premium O2 brand, the O2 Group also seeks to access additional
customer groups through, for example: (i) its wholly-owned MVNO, giffgaff; (ii) its joint venture with Tesco to
operate Tesco Mobile; and (iii) other MVNOs such as Sky Mobile, Lycamobile, Truphone and Manx Telecom.

The O2 Group was the largest MNO in the U.K. mobile telecommunications market in 2020 based on
mobile subscriptions, with an MNO market share of approximately 33.0% (including giffgaff and MVNOs)
(compared to 32.0% in 2019 and 32.1% in 2018). The O2 Group was the second largest MNO in the U.K. mobile
telecommunications market in 2020 based on mobile service revenue, with an MNO market share of
approximately 29.2% (including giffgaff) (compared to 29.9% in 2019 and 2018) (source: Analysys Mason).

As of March 31, 2021, the O2 Group operated 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G mobile networks providing 2G, 3G and
4G voice and data coverage to more than 99% (in at least one band) of the U.K. outdoor population. In the 2021
uSwitch Mobile Awards, O2 won the Best Network for Coverage award (the fourth consecutive year that O2 has
earned this distinction), while giffgaff won the Network of the Year award.

(1) Financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is derived from the O2 Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements, except where otherwise indicated. Financial data for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is derived from the O2 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements,
except where otherwise indicated. See “Summary Financial and Operating Data of the O2 Group”.
(2) Following the introduction of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (“IFRS 15”), the O2
Group no longer reports “Mobile service revenue”, because it no longer believes that “Mobile service
revenue” is an accurate measure of its revenue, as that metric is disproportionately impacted by the
existence of its “O2 Refresh” proposition contracts and ongoing channel strategy. In addition, the O2 Group
believes that the presentation of “Mobile service revenue” is not in line with its competitors in the industry.
(3) Each connection to any of the O2 Group’s telecommunications services is referred to as an “access”. The
O2 Group believes that it is more useful to count the number of accesses a customer has contracted for,
rather than to count only the number of its customers with multiple accesses whether fixed or mobile. As
such, a customer that has a fixed-line telephony service and a mobile service is counted as two accesses.
(4) Prepaid percentage is calculated by dividing the number of prepaid mobile accesses at period end by the
total number of mobile accesses at period end.
(5) Contract percentage is calculated by dividing the number of contract mobile accesses at period end by the
total number of mobile accesses at period end.
(6) Since March 2020, IoT accesses have been reported separately within Mobile accesses and are no longer
reported as part of Contract accesses. As a result, IoT accesses for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 and the comparative period for 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect this new
reporting. IoT accesses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in total Contract
accesses.

**Products and Services**

The O2 Group offers a wide range of mobile telecommunications and value-add services and products to its
consumer and business customers under its premium O2 brand. The O2 Group’s approach focuses on the needs
of its customers with the aim of maintaining and increasing its large, loyal customer base to drive value.

**_Consumer services and products_**

The O2 Group offers consumers mobile services (including mobile voice, messaging and data services)
through post-pay and pre-pay models, and offers a range of hardware, including wearables and handsets in
connection with the O2 Group’s mobile service offerings as well as stand-alone mobile devices and accessories.
In addition, the O2 Group offers consumers a range of value-add services and products, including a digital
loyalty program, Wi-Fi, security services, cloud services, digital payment services and insurance with the aim of
differentiating the customer experience and increasing customer loyalty and engagement.

_Mobile services_

The O2 Group offers its consumer customers mobile voice, messaging and data services which are supplied,
at present, through the purchase of a SIM card. Customers can purchase a SIM card either on its own (a “SIMO”
mobile service) or together with a handset. Mobile services for both SIMO and handset options are offered under
two payment models: “pay monthly” (a post-pay model) and “pay as you go” (a pre-pay model). “Pay as you go”
customers can purchase a handset paying in full upfront. “Pay monthly” customers have access to the “Custom
Plan” proposition (as part of O2 Refresh), which allows customers to spread the cost of their phones over
different terms, flex their data up or down and upgrade.

The O2 Group also provides data-only mobile broadband services over its network. Customers can purchase
data-only plans together with a tablet device, or as a SIMO service purchasing data access devices separately, for
example a laptop dongle or an in-car Wi-Fi device.

The O2 Group also provides its O2 Family offering with the aim to simplify billing processes and provide
discounts (based on the number of connections registered) and support for families. For each family connection
registered, the primary account holder receives one bill (rather than multiple bills throughout the month).

The O2 Group has also introduced embedded SIM cards (“eSIM”) for smartphones and released a 5G eSIM
in the autumn of 2020. We continue to build on this capability and have plans to develop a fully digital
distribution method for eSIM, removing the need for paper eSIM vouchers.

_Hardware sales_

In addition to handsets, tablets and data access devices offered to its mobile customers, the O2 Group offers
a range of stand-alone products, including smart-tech (such as smart watches and fitness devices) and accessories
(such as handset cases, screen protectors, chargers, cables, portable batteries, headphones and speakers).

As part of the O2 Group’s “Like New” offerings, customers are offered a choice of quality-assured
pre-owned handsets. Customers can purchase “Like New” handsets as part of the O2 Group’s “pay monthly” and
“pay as you go” payment models.

O2 Group and non-O2 Group customers can exchange their existing handset through O2 Recycle, a scheme
which allows people to exchange old phones and other gadgets for a price-matched cash payment. Exchanged
devices are processed for re-use, recycling or are disassembled for the re-use of component parts. In 2020, the O2
Group completed 11 years of O2 Recycle and announced that 3.3 million devices had been diverted from
landfills.

**_Business-to-business services and products_**

The O2 Group is one of the major providers of telecommunications services to business customers in the
U.K. The O2 Group offers services to the full range of business customers, from small and medium businesses
(“SMB”) to large national and international enterprise customers and the public sector. The O2 Group offers
mobile, Wi-Fi and fixed-line services, as well as digital services (including unified communication and digital
collaboration services, cloud services, security services and IoT solutions) to its business customer base. The O2
Group has adopted a distinct customer-led, mobile-first approach, offering simple and flexible combinations of
mobile connectivity, handsets and apps to help its SMB customers set up and run their businesses. For its
enterprise and public sector customers, the O2 Group offers a solution-oriented approach focusing on the needs
of the customer and generating measurable business outcomes, such as cost savings and efficiency gains. In
2020, the O2 Group won the Best Business Network Award at the Mobile Industry Awards.

Excluding revenues from the SMIP (as defined herein), the ten largest enterprise customers accounted for
approximately 36% of the total business customer revenue of the O2 Group for the year ended December 31,
2020 and have been with the O2 Group for an average of over 7 years.

_SMB_

The O2 Group offers its SMB customers a competitive mobile service tariff, a wide range of apps providing
digital services and products and fixed-line services including fiber broadband and high-speed internet, with the
aim of helping its business customers’ employees work more efficiently and productively.

connectivity IoT connectivity, security, data analytics and international data connectivity.

The O2 Group offers ongoing management and support to its enterprise customers by providing dedicated
account management as well as solution design, monitoring and maintenance. Customer service advisors are
available to enterprise and multinational customers to address individual support queries.

The O2 Group’s fixed-line services are delivered through wholesale agreements with third parties. The O2
Group believes that it benefits from not having a large base of legacy fixed-line services allowing it to pursue its
customer-led, mobile-first approach and enabling its customers to adopt more flexible and collaborative working
behaviors.

The O2 Group’s focus on partnering with customers to build business solutions, has resulted in new
business from companies like The Very Group, Northumbrian Water, Sainsbury’s and McDonald’s. In the first
year of working with Sainsbury’s, the O2 Group was awarded Sainsbury’s Supplier Award for transformation of
its retail stores network.

**_Public sector_**

The O2 Group provides mobile and managed mobility services, data networks, cloud and security services
to the central government, local government and the voluntary sector in the U.K. The provision of services to the
public sector has been an area of focus of the O2 Group in recent years, and there has been a significant increase
in the number of the O2 Group’s public sector accounts.

The O2 Group provides services to the public sector through a number of public sector frameworks
including the Network Services Framework 2 RM3808 and G-Cloud 11 (replacement framework to the Network
Services Framework RM1045 and G-Cloud 10). The Network Services 2 Framework is an agreement to enable
public sector organizations to purchase a broad range of network connectivity and telecommunications services
from a range of ten individual lots covering different categories of services without the requirement to run a
lengthy full tendering exercise. As part of its customer-led, mobile-first approach, the O2 Group is developing
products and services designed to meet the specific needs of its public sector customers. For example, in 2020 the
O2 Group provided the NHS with tablets with mobile data enabling the NHS to create an end-to-end service and
help with public sector patient care especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as working with ENABLE
Scotland in deploying mobile devices and increasing financial and resourcing efficiencies.

In addition, the O2 Group obtained several information security standards, including Cyber Essentials (an
information assurance assessment framework developed by NCSC and Crest), ISO 27001 (the international
information security management standard for customer and employee data) and ISO 22301 (the international
business continuity standard), to help protect and grow the O2 Group’s public sector business. In addition, the O2
Group is implementing the Telecoms Security Requirements (which is expected to become a regulatory standard)
to ensure that it provides secure services that meet the U.K. Government’s and other public sector bodies’ future
expectations.

existing and potential customers in-store, online and over the phone.

 - _Wi-Fi: O2 Wi-Fi allows O2 Group customers, as well as non-O2 Group customers, to access free Wi-Fi at_
over 15,000 locations across the U.K. as of May 2021. O2 Wi-Fi was also developed to enable the O2
Group’s B2B customers (who can purchase O2 Wi-Fi and offer it to their customers and employees) to
provide their customers with an excellent customer experience within their venues. B2B customers can
choose to purchase additional services in relation to O2 Wi-Fi, including insight services whereby business
customers can learn more about their own customers, through data on, for example, footfall and
demographics. Business customers can also benefit from the O2 Gateway ecosystem and gain access to
additional services, for example increased network resilience by allowing essential services to function on
Wi-Fi in the event that their WAN fails. The O2 Group believes that O2 Wi-Fi is the leading urban public
network. It is offered free to end users regardless of their end network and, with approximately 6.3 million
unique users as of March 31, 2021, and 9.8 million unique users in February 2020 (prior to the COVID-19
related U.K. lockdown), it allows the O2 Group to access a wider potential customer base and introduce
potential O2 Group customers to the O2 brand and its core business.

 - _Communications: Wi-Fi Calling (also called Voice over Wi-Fi or VoWi-Fi), allows customers to make and_
receive calls even if they cannot connect to the mobile network. 4G Calling (also called Voice over LTE or
VoLTE) allows customers to make calls using its 4G network, for a clearer voice call. In 4G Calling areas,
Wi-Fi and 4G Calling work together to provide a seamless and uninterrupted experience as customers move
from one to another, without calls being dropped.

 - _Payment services: Charge to Mobile allows customers to buy digital content through their handset, with the_
cost of the product added to their monthly mobile bill for “pay monthly” customers or taken from their
mobile credit for “pay as you go” customers.

 - _MyO2: MyO2 is an app enabling Enterprise, SMB and Consumer customers to check their bill, add or_
change the services they take from O2, or to deal with simple issues. It is the most popular customer
destination and the highest volume service channel where customers are choosing to self-serve rather than
use traditional customer service channels. Customers can view personalized tariff and device
recommendations if they are close to requiring an upgrade. SMBs have a dedicated service team with a
sector focus.

 - _O2 Extras: The O2 Group launched O2 Extras in partnership with, among others, Amazon, Cafeyn and_
MelodyVR. O2 Extras gives O2 Group customers the ability to pick a selected product provided by one of
its partners to enjoy alongside all the usual benefits of their tariff. In March 2020, the O2 Group expanded
its O2 Extra offering and signed an exclusive agreement with Disney and became the only U.K. mobile
network operator to offer Disney+ subscription to its customers.

The O2 Group also offers paid services and products with the aim of leveraging the O2 Group’s strong
position in the U.K. mobile service market and monetizing additional growth opportunities, including (i) mobile
and tablet insurance, (ii) international calling bolt-ons which allow customers to make international calls from 1p
per minute for £3 per month, and (iii) the O2 Travel bolt-on, which allows customers to call, text and use data at
significantly reduced rates (compared with the O2 Group’s standard rates) while roaming abroad.

**_Digital services_**

The O2 Group is continually evolving its business model and developing new digital products and services
including personalized customer offerings and rewards, with the aim of playing a broader role in its customers’
digital lives while delivering a differentiated customer experience. The O2 Group’s development of new digital
products and services is led by its customer-led, mobile-first strategy. The O2 Group aims to improve the
customer experience by providing products and services tailored to the needs of consumers and businesses (such
as unified communication and collaboration services, cloud services and managed network segments) and to use
the O2 Group’s significant customer base and information assets to diversify revenue beyond the O2 Group’s
traditional mobile service provisions.

**_Internet of Things_**

The O2 Group offers products and services in the IoT (which includes activities sometimes referred to as
“machine-to-machine” or “M2M”) which provides automated data communications between devices (including
vehicle fleets, payment terminals and traffic lights) via its mobile network, to help businesses reduce costs and
grow revenue through greater convenience and improved customer experience.

In 2013, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the U.K. Government awarded the
O2 Group a 15-year contract initially worth approximately £1.5 billion to deliver communications services
(including the supply of communication hubs) for 23 million homes in the central and southern regions of the
U.K. as part of the Smart Metering Implementation Program (“SMIP”), one of the largest IoT projects in the
world. SMIP has been rolling out millions of gas and electricity smart meters across the U.K. to help reduce
energy usage and CO2 emissions by providing greater visibility of energy consumption. The O2 Group is a core
communications service provider within SMIP, and the program is a key part of the U.K.’s drive towards a low
carbon economy and supports the goal of being carbon neutral as a country by 2050.

**_Commerce_**

The O2 Group uses its large and growing customer base of mobile customers and registered O2 Wi-Fi users
to diversify its revenue beyond traditional mobile services. This includes the following commerce services which
are currently offered by the O2 Group:

    - _Insights: The O2 Group offers a suite of big-data driven insights services, which aim to help businesses_
understand their customers and improve their customer engagement and sales strategy. The O2 Group’s
insight services use aggregated, anonymized data from the O2 Group’s opted-in customers and users to
offer accurate and targeted information to businesses.

    - _Messaging: O2 helps businesses engage with their customers and employees by enabling them to send_
automated text messages.

**_giffgaff, Tesco Mobile and Wholesale Partners_**

In addition to its business under the premium O2 brand, the O2 Group has a wholly-owned digital brand,
giffgaff, and a joint venture, Tesco Mobile. In addition, the O2 Group is the leading wholesale provider in the
U.K. in terms of the number of MVNO subscribers (including Tesco Mobile, Sky Mobile, Lycamobile, Truphone
and Manx Telecom), providing wholesale MVNO partners access to the O2 Group’s mobile network and
infrastructure which enables MVNOs to provide mobile telecommunications services to their customers.
Through these arrangements, the O2 Group seeks to expand its reach across the U.K. telecommunications market
and access additional complementary customer groups, including loyal Tesco customers (such as Tesco Clubcard
holders) through the joint venture with Tesco, and expatriate communities through the MVNO partnership with
Lycamobile.

_giffgaff_

giffgaff is a 100% owned subsidiary within the O2 Group, and is an online-only MVNO providing
telecommunications services to the consumer mobile segment. It has no call centers or shops, resulting in a
highly-efficient member service model with significantly reduced customer service costs. giffgaff’s core business
is the provision of pre-pay, SIM only mobile services, but it also offers new and refurbished handsets (outright or
via a loan from our finance partner). As of March 31, 2021, giffgaff’s member base was approximately
4.5 million.

_Tesco Mobile_

Tesco Mobile is a 50:50 joint venture between certain subsidiaries of Tesco and the O2 Group providing
mobile services in the U.K. The business has continually grown and developed, and is now the largest MVNO in
the U.K. in terms of mobile subscribers, offering a full range of pre-pay and post-pay mobile services (both
SIMO or with a handset).

Tesco Mobile offers its services and products across multiple channels, including through extensive national
store coverage as part of Tesco stores, together with telesales and online sales. A significant number of Tesco
Mobile’s customers are also Tesco Clubcard holders. As of March 31, 2021, Tesco Mobile had approximately
5.1 million customers.

_Lycamobile_

Lycamobile considers itself to be one of the world’s largest international MVNOs with 16 million customers
in 23 countries worldwide. Lycamobile targets expatriate communities in the U.K., primarily through its
international “pay as you go” SIM cards which provide low cost international calls. The O2 Group last renewed
its MVNO agreement with Lycamobile in 2021.

_Sky_

Sky, the largest U.K. pay-television broadcaster, entered into an exclusive, multi-year MVNO agreement
with the O2 Group in 2015, allowing Sky to offer mobile services in addition to the fixed-line telephony, fixedline broadband internet and television services that it already offered to its customers. The O2 Group’s MVNO
agreement with Sky was extended on a long-term basis in 2021.

**Network Infrastructure**

**_Mobile network_**

The O2 Group operates a mobile access network based on 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G standards. As of March 31,
2021, the O2 Group’s network sharing arrangement with Vodafone consisted of more than 17,300 shared mobile
sites (in addition to those operated separately by the O2 Group) with 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G base stations
(connecting handsets to the O2 Group’s mobile network using available spectrum), backhaul (the transport link
between the mobile sites and the O2 Group’s core network), the core network (composed of data centers which
store customer information and location and switching sites which route voice calls and data to their intended
destination) and a service layer (which provides messaging and voicemail capabilities).

The O2 Group has a comprehensive 4G mobile network across the U.K. extending to over 99% outdoor
population coverage as of March 31, 2021.

The table below provides an overview of the O2 Group’s 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G outdoor and indoor U.K.
population coverage and U.K. geographic coverage as at March 31, 2021.

Through the Shared Rural Network, the four major MNOs in the U.K., including the O2 Group, are each
conditionally committed to delivering high-quality 4G geographic coverage to at least 90% of the U.K. landmass
by January 2027. The O2 Group is also currently required to provide 99.25% mobile telecommunications
coverage to homes in the SMIP-designated central and southern regions of the U.K. in connection with the SMIP
contract awarded to the O2 Group in 2013. See “—Products and Services—Internet of Things” above for more
information.

The O2 Group launched its next generation 5G mobile network in 2019, and as of March 31, 2021 had 5G
service in 183 towns and cities across the U.K. The O2 Group targets extending 5G service to over 200 towns
and cities in the U.K. by the end of June 2021. Through its continuing network sharing arrangement with

127


-----

Vodafone, the O2 Group expects to be able to actively roll out the 5G network faster than would otherwise be
possible. The O2 Group believes itself to be well placed to continue its 5G roll-out notwithstanding the U.K.
Government’s decision to remove all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by the end of 2027.

The O2 Group’s network strategy focuses on coverage and reliability, which it believes are the two key
factors that customers value with respect to a mobile network. The O2 Group believes that this customer-led,
mobile-first strategy has been instrumental in helping it establish a leading position in the U.K. mobile
telecommunications market as well as high customer loyalty, demonstrated by O2 winning the Best Network for
Coverage award (for the fourth year running) and giffgaff winning Network of the Year in the 2021 uSwitch
Mobile Awards, both as voted for by members of the public.

_Network coverage and reliability_

The O2 Group has aimed to continually improve its network coverage and reliability to deliver a world-class
service for its customers.

The O2 Group invests in its network to help its customers, remain competitive and exploit the potential that
5G technology can provide. The O2 Group’s network sharing arrangement with Vodafone creates a single,
national grid of more than 17,300 shared mobile sites across the U.K. as of March 31, 2021, which provides
comprehensive network coverage and will allow more people to access 5G technology faster than would
otherwise be possible. See “—Backhaul and Transport—Network sharing arrangement between Vodafone
_Limited and Telefonica UK Limited” below for more information._

The O2 Group has invested in obtaining a significant share of the lower frequency spectrum which helps it
achieve greater coverage both indoor and outdoor (see “—Licenses and frequencies” below). The O2 Group has
licenses for approximately 36% of the sub 1 GHz spectrum compared to approximately 26% licensed to
Vodafone, 24% licensed to EE/BT and 14% licensed to Three. Lower frequency spectrum can travel longer
distances than higher frequency spectrum and pass more easily through walls, increasing indoor and outdoor
coverage.

The O2 Group regularly conducts independent drive testing of its network, performing a series of voice calls
and mobile data tests to ensure these represent a true customer experience. Reports are produced against a
number of key performance indicators including call completion success rates and data speeds. The O2 Group
also crowdsources information from Tutela. This information enables a technical comparison against the O2
Group’s competitors and a customer experience view of the O2 network.

The resilience of the O2 network has been demonstrated in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April
2020, phone calls increased 25%, with the first week of the U.K. lockdown seeing a 57% peak increase in calls
carried across the O2 network. Following the return of Premier League football on June 17, 2020, nationwide
data usage surged by 13% at 8pm as the first games were played. As of March 31, 2021, the O2 network had
successfully managed the increase in traffic of all kinds without major incident.

_Capacity and spectrum management_

Spectrum licenses are currently divided between the four MNOs active in the U.K. mobile
telecommunications service market, with approximately 32% of allocated spectrum licensed to EE/BT,
approximately 24% licensed to Vodafone, approximately 22% licensed to Three and approximately 22% licensed
to O2.

The O2 Group undertakes a number of measures to manage and expand its network capacity and ensure that
the O2 Group has sufficient capacity to meet customer demand. The O2 Group is building small cell sites to
increase capacity particularly in built-up areas where there is not enough room for full scale mast sites. The O2
Group has an ongoing refarming process designed to ensure the most efficient use of its spectrum assets,
specifically—the O2 Group is reducing the spectrum used by its 2G and 3G networks to a minimum, and will be
looking to maximize the spectrum available to its 4G and 5G networks. In April 2021, Ofcom held a spectrum
auction of 700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8GHz bands, which are suitable for 4G and 5G. Telefonica UK Limited acquired
20 MHz of paired 700 MHz FDD spectrum and 40 MHz of 3.6 - 3.8 GHz spectrum. As part of the same auction,
Telefonica UK Limited agreed to trade holdings in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band with Vodafone in order to allow it to
defragment its spectrum and create a contiguous block of 80 MHz in the same band. This is in addition to the 25
MHz of the 2.6 GHz band Telefonica UK Limited acquired from EE in 2020. See “—Licenses and frequencies”
below for more information.

128


-----

In the future, the O2 Group may also be able to manage its network capacity through the successful
application of a variety of yield management techniques. See “Risk Factors—Our ability to meet growing
_customer demand for mobile services and to expand our business depends, in part, on the capacity, speed and_
_reliability of our mobile network which in turn depends on our ability to adequately manage network capacity_
_and usage levels, successfully implement capacity expansion and yield management strategies, and acquire_
_additional spectrum”._

_London capacity program_

The O2 Group’s London capacity program aims to transform and optimize the O2 Group’s network capacity
within London. The program uses a number of strategies to achieve this, including significant transfer of
frequencies in central London, deployment of small cell sites and strategically placed additional Wi-Fi hotspots
to offload capacity.

**_Backhaul and transport_**

_Backhaul services between the O2 Group’s mobile sites and core network_

Traffic is transported between the O2 Group’s mobile sites and its core network using a diverse portfolio of
backhaul solutions. These include optical links managed by BT and Virgin Media Communications Limited as
well as self-built wireless connections via point-to-point microwave systems. This approach provides the O2
Group with the ability to connect its mobile sites and core network quickly, flexibly and cost-effectively.

_Interconnections within the O2 Group’s core network_

The O2 Group’s core network is composed of a number of switching sites and data centers across the U.K.
In 2016, the O2 Group migrated to a dedicated high capacity “dark-fiber” network which improved the capacity
and scalability of the O2 Group’s core network allowing it to accommodate increasing demand for mobile data
driven by the O2 Group’s 4G roll-out and increasing data usage by the O2 Group’s customer base.

_Network sharing arrangement between Vodafone Limited and Telefonica UK Limited_

In 2012, Telefonica UK Limited and Vodafone entered into a network sharing arrangement under which
Telefonica UK Limited and Vodafone agreed to share their collective mobile sites to form a single, national grid
of mobile sites across the whole of the U.K. In 2019, Telefonica UK Limited and Vodafone announced a further
agreement to share 5G active equipment, such as radio antennae, on joint network sites in certain parts of the
U.K.

Under the network sharing arrangement, both Vodafone and Telefonica UK Limited (through a 50:50 joint
venture company, “CTIL”) have access to a single grid of more than 17,300 shared mobile sites as of March 31,
2021. Telefonica UK Limited has thus been able to decommission 3,575 mobile sites thereby reducing costs. The
network sharing agreement also requires the building of new mobile sites needed to extend coverage into rural
and remote areas or to increase capacity as required in relevant areas.

The network sharing arrangement has two distinct elements: a passive infrastructure share and an active
RAN share.

The passive infrastructure share is managed by CTIL into which Telefonica UK Limited and Vodafone
contributed their existing site management businesses (including the mobile sites and physical assets deployed on
the mobile sites which are used in association with the RAN). CTIL manages and provides the parties with access
to all mobile sites and passive RAN assets which form part of a single national grid. In January 2021, the O2
Group and Vodafone announced a new Master Services Agreement, which will provide for operational simplicity
and efficiency, and will enable CTIL to generate revenue by offering space on infrastructure to third parties.

The active RAN share component involves sharing of Telefonica UK Limited’s and Vodafone’s 2G, 3G, 4G
and 5G networks (except in London and certain other major cities). The shared network is managed by each party
separately based on a geographical split: Telefonica UK Limited is responsible for managing the active
component of the shared network in the Eastern half of the U.K., Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and North
London, and Vodafone is responsible for managing the active component of the shared network in the Western
half of the U.K. (including Wales) and South London.

129


-----

Each party acts as host operator in its allotted geographical region and, as such, in that region provides
active sharing services to the other party (the “sharing operator”). The parties’ responsibilities in their allocated
regions include the design, deployment, operation and maintenance of the active elements of the RAN. Backhaul
to and from the mobile sites is provided by the host operator. For each shared site, a single set of base station
equipment transmits signals at the host operator’s frequencies (for the host’s traffic) and at the sharing operator’s
frequencies (for the sharer’s traffic) using 2G, 3G,4G and 5G technologies as required by the sharer (in London
only 4G is currently actively shared, which is set to stop following mutual agreement, and 5G will similarly not
be shared in London and certain other cities). In its region, the host operator operates two separate RANs: (i) a
host RAN for its own traffic; and (ii) a managed RAN for the sharing operator’s traffic, using shared passive
physical equipment managed across the U.K. by CTIL.

As part of these arrangements, the parties entered into a managed network services agreement which sets out
an agreed target number of shared mobile sites forming the single grid including contractual deployment
milestones with minimum network capabilities and performance standards. Together these elements constitute
the “basic demand” which determines the coverage, capacity and capability which the host operator must provide
to the sharing operator. Each party may request further coverage, capacity or capability anywhere in the U.K.
which exceeds this basic demand. If the other party wants to share that additional coverage, capacity or capability
it is provided by the host operator for the use of both parties; otherwise it will be provided unilaterally for the
sharing operator.

**_Licenses and frequencies_**

The O2 Group has the following spectrum holdings: 2 x 10 MHz of 800 MHz, 2 x 17.4 MHz of 900 MHz,
2 x 5.8 MHz of 1.8 GHz and 2 x 10 MHz of 2.1 GHz, in addition to the 40 MHz of 2.3 GHz, 3.4 GHz and
3.6 GHz spectrum referred to below. The O2 Group’s spectrum licenses are effective until revoked by Ofcom or
surrendered by the O2 Group.

Although no license or authorization is required to operate a telecommunications network or provide a
telecommunications service in the U.K., operators must obtain a license under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006
in order to use radio frequency spectrum.

Spectrum licenses for an agreed block of spectrum can be awarded by auction or through negotiation with
Ofcom. However, Ofcom’s established policy has been to use auctions as a means of allocating spectrum. In
2018 Ofcom completed a mobile spectrum auction pursuant to which licenses were awarded in 2.3 GHz and
3.4 GHz bands suitable for 4G and 5G deployment. The O2 Group was awarded licenses to 2350 - 2390 MHz
(2.3 GHz) and 3500 - 3540 MHz (3.4 GHz) of spectrum following the 2018 auction. In 2020, Telefonica UK
Limited acquired 25 MHz of the 2.6 GHz spectrum band from EE. In April 2021, Ofcom completed a mobile
spectrum auction of the 700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8 GHz bands pursuant to which the O2 Group was awarded a paired
licence covering 703 - 713 MHz and 758 - 768 MHz (700 MHz) and 3760 - 3800 (3.6 GHz). As part of the same
auction, O2 Group agreed to trade holdings in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band with Vodafone, in order to allow it to
defragment its spectrum and create a contiguous block of 80 MHz.

The O2 Group intends to review all opportunities for additional future spectrum in order to improve
capacity on its network and enhance its ability to deliver high-quality mobile services. The analysis of future
spectrum opportunities and the management of network capacity and usage levels are, and are expected to
continue to remain, key strategic priorities for the O2 Group.

**Brand and Marketing**

**_Brand and marketing_**

The O2 brand is at the heart of the O2 Group’s business. The O2 brand was founded on the idea that mobile
connectivity is like oxygen: essential for life.

The O2 Group engages in a variety of marketing activities, both paid and unpaid. The O2 Group advertises
its premium O2 brand through a range of media channels including national television, radio, print, online and
outdoor advertising, and uses social media to raise awareness of the O2 brand. The O2 Group increasingly uses
online marketing and social media to build interest in its products. The O2 Group believes that integrating sales
activity with innovative proposition development and creative campaigns has helped it increase its market share
in SMB and enterprise businesses and the public sector.

130


-----

In 2019, the O2 Group implemented Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) supporting the O2 Group’s strategy to
improve its customer experience by listening to customers and delivering the best possible experience to create
true brand advocates. NPS measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company to others. The O2
Group maintained its market-leading position in overall NPS ending 2020 with a score of 29.

The O2 Group believes that its brand strategy has helped grow its customer base and maintain customer
loyalty resulting in market-leading total revenue growth.

**_Intellectual property rights_**

The “O2”, “O2 Refresh” and “Priority” brands and related rights (the “O2 Brand Rights”) are licensed to
Telefonica UK Limited for use in the U.K. under an indefinite trademark license. The license is royalty-free but
it is granted in consideration of Telefonica UK Limited paying for certain general and specific brand costs
according to a separate cost sharing agreement.

The “giffgaff” brand and trademarks are owned by Telefonica UK Limited. The “Tesco Mobile” brand is
owned by Tesco Stores Limited and licensed to the joint venture.

**_Sponsorship_**

O2 partners with organizations and businesses as part of its brand strategy to raise the brand’s profile and
appeal to new and existing customers. For over a decade the O2 Group’s Sponsorship portfolio has focused on
three long-term deals: AEG (The O2), RFU (England Rugby) and Live Nation (O2 Academy venues and Priority
Tickets).

In 2007, the O2 Group became the sponsor of The O2 in London, rebranding and transforming the
Millennium Dome into an entertainment venue. The O2 has since become the most popular entertainment venue
in the world, selling over 25 million tickets in the fourteen years since its launch, and is consistently one of the
top-selling entertainment venues globally each year. The O2 generates significant media value for the O2 Group
by providing free coverage for the O2 brand through the press, online and TV viewing and through attendance at
events at The O2.

The O2 Group also sponsors a number of other well-known music venues including O2 Academy Brixton,
O2 Shepherds Bush Empire and O2 Academy Glasgow, to form a network of O2 Academy branded music
venues. As of May 7, 2020, there were 20 O2 Academy venues across 13 cities in the U.K. which attracted over
3.2 million visitors to more than 3,300 music events in 2019 prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Sales and Distribution**

**_Direct channels_**

The O2 Group continues to move towards an omni-channel sales approach for its direct sales, offering
customers the ability to research, purchase and collect products through three primary sales channels: stores (both
O2-owned and franchised), online and telesales. The O2 Group has increasingly focused on delivering an
integrated and seamless experience across different elements of its direct distribution channels. The O2 Group
believes that these omni-channel offerings help it achieve high customer engagement, higher value customers
and high customer satisfaction.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, O2-owned franchise stores were traditionally the largest direct sales
channels. As of December 31, 2020, the O2 Group offered its products and services through 436 stores (233
O2-owned stores and 203 franchise stores). O2-owned stores and franchise stores are generally located in highly
frequented and strategically important areas, such as high streets in urban centers, and offer exclusively O2
branded services. The O2 Group estimates that O2-owned and franchise stores had in aggregate approximately
1.4 million visitors per month during the year ended December 31, 2019 and approximately 0.8 million visitors
per month during the year ended December 31, 2020, with the decrease attributable to the U.K. lockdowns in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the O2 Group has revamped its
physical store presence with new layouts and a virtual queuing system to save customer waiting time. The result
is a more personal service which also reduces customer waiting time.

The O2 Group conducts sales to Small Office / Home Office (“SOHO”) customers through its existing O2
direct sales and distribution channels (stores, online and telesales), using specialist sales advisors to help deliver
customer retention, acquisition and upgrades. The O2 Group conducts sales to SMB customers primarily through
a team of desk-based digital advisors and acquisition and sales specialists. The O2 Group conducts sales to
enterprise customers using field-based account management and acquisition teams as well as specialist sales
advisors and conducts sales to public sector customers through a dedicated public sector team.

The O2 Group also sells products and services directly through the O2 website and the MyO2 mobile app.
The O2 website has a specific business site in addition to its consumer site, with a dedicated online shop for SMB
customers. The O2 website had an average of 33.0 million visits per month during the year ended December 31,
2020, and there were approximately 11.2 million visits per month in the same period to the MyO2 mobile app.

In addition, the O2 Group sells products through telesales, and there were approximately 1.2 million
contacts per month during the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Indirect channels_**

The O2 Group uses indirect channels as a means of increasing its customer reach and as a supplement to the
O2 Group’s direct distribution channels. The O2 Group has three indirect B2B sales and distribution channels:
business partners, distributors and wholesale partners. O2 business partners enter into an exclusive contract with
the O2 Group to sell mobile, fixed-line and digital services to predominantly SMB customers. The O2 Group
uses two key distributors (Digital Wholesale Solution and Carphone Warehouse Business) who manage a
network of stockists to sell O2 products and services to SMB customers. The O2 Group has a number of
wholesale partners who sell O2 mobile services under their own brand and bill customers directly.

**Customer Service**

The O2 Group is committed to providing an excellent end-to-end customer experience. In Ofcom’s
“Comparing Service Quality” Report of August 21, 2020, the O2 Group was joint first with another MNO (ahead
of Vodafone) for customer service satisfaction. In the latest Ofcom “Comparing Customer Service” Report of
May 7, 2021, the O2 Group was the second highest ranked MNO overall, with giffgaff having the highest
satisfaction with service overall of the assessed MNOs and MVNOs. The O2 Group was one of the top two
MNOs receiving the fewest Ofcom complaints (along with EE), as ranked by Ofcom in both of the
aforementioned reports. The O2 Group has significant outsourcing partnerships in connection with its customer
service offering.

In order to effectively manage customer credit risks, the O2 Group has a series of business acceptance
procedures including identity verification, credit and fraud checks and affordability assessments. The O2 Group
has collections policies in place to ensure that customers who are struggling to make payments are treated fairly.
The O2 Group’s arrears management process follows the general principles of treating customers as individuals,
contacting customers at the earliest opportunity, focusing on achieving the best outcome for the customer and
being aware of customer vulnerabilities.

**IT Systems and Security**

The O2 Group operates a large-scale IT estate and portfolio to support its customers. The O2 Group uses a
range of tools to actively identify vulnerabilities in its platforms and systems and deploys systems, tools and
analytics to tackle intrusion and secure the O2 Group’s network perimeter. Following a high profile cyberattack
on another market participant in 2015, the O2 Group launched a cyber defense program aimed at further
improving the strength of the O2 Group’s security systems and the O2 Group continues to recognize cyber
security as one of its greatest areas of risk.

The O2 Group’s employees are key to its business and culture. The O2 Group aims to achieve high levels of
employee engagement in order to achieve high levels of performance. The O2 Group has good relations with its
two trade unions, CWU and Prospect, and with its employee representatives. As at the date of this offering
memorandum, all discussions between the O2 Group and the trade unions and employee representatives have
concluded in agreement.

**Environment**

The O2 Group’s activities, similar to any other telecommunications company, has an impact on the
environment and can be impacted by climate change. The environmental and climate change risks of the O2
Group are controlled and managed under a global risk management model. The material environmental risks of
the O2 Group include the risks of flooding and business interruption as a result of climate change that are
associated with the O2 Group’s high geographic dispersion of infrastructure, of which such risks are mitigated
through its environmental management based processes and have been certified according to the ISO 14001
standard and business continuity plans, as further described below.

In addition, the O2 Group specifically analyzes and manages its risks and opportunities as a result of climate
change in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures. In
order to manage its risks, the O2 Group has put in place strategies to help increase its resilience to climate
change, including by planning for and adapting to both the physical consequences of climate change and the
changes arising from a transition to a low carbon economy. The main measures included in the O2 Group’s
mitigation plans are (i) its business continuity plans in case of climate disasters, (ii) its energy efficiency and
renewable energy plans, which enable the O2 Group to reduce its power consumption, fossil fuel consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions, and (iii) its wider plans relating to the transition to a low carbon economy that
take into account regulatory, technological, market and reputational risks.

In 2020, the O2 Group updated its Blueprint sustainability commitments with a focus on building a greener
network, including goals of removing non-renewable energy across its network and operations to become a net
zero business by 2025. The O2 Group is also committed to reducing its carbon emissions by at least 39% across
its value chain by 2025, and to deliver a net zero value chain by 2040.

In October 2020, Telefonica UK Limited was re-certified to the Carbon Trust’s Triple Standard, which is
awarded to companies that demonstrate success in cutting their carbon, water and waste footprints. Telefonica
UK Limited, as a subsidiary of Telefónica, has also been recognized for its high quality disclosure of its
environmental impacts by virtue of Telefónica being included on the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate change
“A list” from 2017 to 2020. See also “Summary—O2 Group Overview—Sustainability Strategy of the O2
_Group”._

**Property and leases**

As at December 31, 2020, the O2 Group operated through 436 stores around the U.K. (233 O2-owned stores
and 203 franchise stores), 17 technical sites and large office sites in Leeds and Preston Brook as well as its head
office at 260 Bath Road, Slough, U.K.

Under the network sharing arrangement between the companies, both Vodafone and Telefonica UK Limited
(through CTIL, the 50:50 joint venture company) have access to a single grid of more than 17,300 shared mobile
sites as of March 31, 2021. CTIL holds almost all of the mobile sites (either wholly or by holding space on the
site) under operating lease agreements.

**Insurance**

The O2 Group maintains insurance coverage in line with industry practice. The O2 Group is insured for,
among other things, material damage and business interruption, known all risk insurance including cyber risk and
crime, corporate/general/public liability, products liability, property damage, environmental liability, errors and
omission, terrorism, patent infringement, pension trustee liability, motor fleet insurance, employer’s liability and
directors’ and officers’ liability. The O2 Group has coverage under a Personal Accident and Travel policy, and a
U.K. Warehouse Policy.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, the O2 Group has become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our
operations in the normal course of business.

The O2 Group has been addressing a request for disclosure made by governmental authorities which is
related to possible violations of anti-bribery laws and regulations. The O2 Group continues to co-operate with the
governmental authorities investigating this matter which is still ongoing. Also the O2 Group continues to conduct
its own internal investigation on the matter. Whilst it is not possible at this time to predict the full scope or
duration of this matter or its eventual outcome, the O2 Group considers it can make a reliable estimate of the
outcome and has made an accrual for this amount at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Legal proceedings have been issued in the High Court against the O2 Group by the Administrators of
Phones 4u. The O2 Group has vigorously denied the allegations and filed its defense to this claim in April 2019.
No provision has been made in relation to this matter.

For additional information, see note 31, note 36 and note 37 to the O2 Annual Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, and note 30 and note 31 to the O2 Interim Condensed

**SUSTAINABILITY OF THE O2 GROUP**

In this “Sustainability of the O2 Group”, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company,” and “us” refers to the O2
Group, unless otherwise stated.

The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
The O2’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, particularly in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.

**Overview**

The O2 Group has a sustainability strategy (the “Blueprint Strategy”). The Blueprint Strategy was
launched in August 2020 and includes long-term targets to reflect the O2 Group’s commitment to reduce its
impact on the environment, and deliver a greener network for customers, by promoting the enabling role of
mobile in delivering a more sustainable future. It sets out its responsibility to society by helping people enjoy a
safer and more positive relationship with technology, and by improving digital access and inclusion. The
Blueprint Strategy also reflects the O2 Group’s commitment to running its business responsibly for its customers,
its people and other key stakeholders, by championing diversity and inclusion, and by building an ethical culture
and maintaining strong community ties.

The Blueprint Strategy has three primary commitments:

    - **Building a greener future by becoming a net zero business by 2025 (with the goal that the O2**
Group’s value chain reduce its emissions by 39% by 2025 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040) and
offering mobile and digital innovation to customers to make a low-carbon world a reality;

    - **Helping society thrive by promoting greener, more inclusive and resilient communities powered by**
smart technology; and

    - **Leading by example by championing a fair and ethical business from the inside as an inclusive**
employer and adopting ethical decision making as well as creating shared accountability.

The Blueprint Strategy is aligned with, and contributes to, eight of the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals, which aim to tackle pressing global challenges such as climate change, injustice and
equality, namely:

    - Promoting the use of affordable, safe, sustainable and modern energy for all;

    - Supporting sustainable consumption and production models;

    - Taking urgent action to fight climate change and its impacts;

    - Boosting connectivity and fostering innovation;

    - Reducing inequality and championing inclusion;

    - Enabling communities to benefit from the development and use of smart technologies;

    - Achieving gender equality; and

    - Promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.

The Blueprint Strategy is also underpinned by a commitment to operating responsibly in everything the O2
Group does. The Blueprint Strategy’s core values of “Bold, Open and Trusted” (representing the O2 Group’s
bold attitude, openness to its customers and people and its strong emphasis on earning the trust of its people and
customers) and its business principles (which form the O2 Group’s ethical code) help guide behaviours at all
levels of the organisation.

**Environment: Building a greener future**

We plan to reduce emissions, do what we can to protect the environment and encourage as many people as
we can to reduce their impact through digital connectivity. We believe that mobile technology can deliver
environmental benefits for society that outweigh our own impacts, by helping to make it easier for our business
partners, suppliers and customers to make more sustainable choices. We launched a Green Savings Calculator to
help businesses identify ways to reduce their carbon footprint and save money with long-term flexible working.
The Green Savings Calculator finds annual savings of 534 tonnes of carbon and £2.6 million on energy, property
and travel costs for an average U.K. PLC with 1,000 employees, and an overall estimated £53 billion saving.

Our goal for our own operations to be net zero by 2025 is an ambitious undertaking, but we believe in the
importance of taking timely and decisive action to combat climate change. Our commitment is aligned to the
Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”), which assists companies in setting emission reduction goals in line
with the Paris Agreement, and goes beyond the initiative’s steps necessary to support a limitation of global
warming to 1.5ºC. In addition, we are working in partnership with the Carbon Trust to develop a clear roadmap
to achieve our net zero goal. In 2020, we published a whitepaper “The journey to net zero” which outlines a fivestep process to creating a net zero framework, and details our plans, progress, and learnings so far, with advice
and support to help other businesses join us on the journey.

We aim to remove all possible non-renewable energy usage across our business and network. Our network
is already powered by 100% renewable energy, wherever we directly control the energy bill. For masts and sites
where we do not have operational control, we are working with our landlords to promote the switch to renewable
energy. We carried out 732 site surveys in 2020 and will use the results to inform our activities in 2021 as we
continue to influence the transition to renewable energy.

We are also undertaking multiple energy efficiency measures, including advanced automation, and “turn
off” technology on our networks when demand is low, LED lighting upgrades, and enhanced free air-cooling
processes. The implementation of such energy efficiency measures have resulted in an 82% overall improvement
in our energy efficiency since 2015. Additionally, we partnered with SSE Business Energy and launched a new
offer for all O2 suppliers and business partners in the U.K., giving them the chance to buy SSE Green renewable
electricity at an exclusive rate. Our carrier partners deployed 730 electric vehicles for our deliveries at depots
across the U.K. by the end of 2020.

In addition to the O2 Group being certified to the environmental management system ISO 14001, Telefonica
UK Limited is also certified to the Carbon Trust’s Triple Standard for carbon, water and waste management. We
are always looking for ways to remove or reduce our plastic use, both in our offices and in our stores. We do not
use plastic bags in our shops, we have reduced the plastic used in SIM-card packaging and encouraged the use of
re-usable tableware in our offices as well as recycling uniforms in our stores.

Our customers can use our Eco Rating scheme to find out more about the social and environmental impact
of our handset range or to recycle their old devices with O2 Recycle, thereby extending the life of mobile phones
and helping to save waste from going to landfill. We also work closely with our suppliers to help them set carbon
goals: currently, over 20% of our supply chain have agreed to carbon emission reduction plans. Through our
returns, repairs and recycling partners, we have delivered an average of 10% year on year reduction in carbon
emissions for the devices we have processed. We also encourage suppliers to reduce their reliance on single-use
plastics, to use renewable energy, and to proactively manage sustainability within their own supply chain.

**Social: Helping society thrive**

We want to keep communities connected by making our products and services accessible to everyone and
by helping people enjoy a safer and more positive experience with technology. We focus our efforts around
causes that link to the social responsibilities we face as a business. We believe that everyone should be able to
safely access our products and services, and we strive to ensure that we support the most vulnerable members of
the communities in which we operate.

The COVID-19 pandemic underlined the importance of equal access to digital connectivity. As a result, we
established a new Community Calling scheme with environmental charity Hubbub to refurbish and gift
smartphones and tablets to the most vulnerable people in six cities across the U.K. Working in partnership with
local community organisations and reputable charities, we are offering devices to those most in need, plus 12
months of free connectivity including unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 6GB of data per month.

136


-----

We are also collaborating with the U.K. government and other mobile providers to deliver a Shared Rural
Network that will reach every part of the U.K., promoting digital inclusion and ensuring that the benefits of
connectivity can be enjoyed by everyone.

Our partnership with the U.K.’s leading child protection charity, the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children (“NSPCC”), continues to focus on keeping families and children safe online. We offer online
safety initiatives, such as Net Aware, which provides advice and support in relation to the most popular apps,
games and websites used by children. In 2020, we delivered 681,301 social impacts through our partnership with
the NSPCC, which is how we describe ways in which we have helped people have a healthier, more positive
relationships with technology through the tools, program, products and services we offer. Our Content Standards
Policy covers our approach to content classification, age-verification, and the work we do with the Internet
Watch Foundation to block illegal content.

**Governance: Leading by example**

We put responsibility at the heart of everything we do, by championing a fair, inclusive, and ethical
business, and we believe we maintain the highest standards in our own decision making. Our Responsible
Business Taskforce oversees our social, ethical and environmental impacts, identifying and prioritising the issues
that matter most to our business and stakeholders. It includes senior representatives from each business area, is
chaired by the Director of Corporate Affairs and reports directly to our board of directors. To increase our
employees’ commitment to achieving our sustainability ambitions, 20% of our employees’ annual variable
remuneration, including for our board members, are linked to sustainability issues.

Local risk registers are kept for all non-financial risks as part of the company-wide process. Identified risks
for online safety are managed through our age verification and content classification procedures. The key
environmental risks are associated with climate change including the continued availability of renewable energy
and the potential for floods to impact the delivery of our services.

Our employees are key in helping us deliver our responsible business goals. Each employee has an annual
Blueprint objective and is encouraged to fundraise and volunteer their time to support our key causes. For
example, such as by supporting Telefonica’s International Volunteering Week by making green pledges,
donating phones or by participating in different fund-raising events for the NSPCC.

Our ambition is to be a leading inclusive employer and to become a truly representative business by 2025.
We aim to achieve a 50:50 gender balance, alongside Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation of at least
15%, across all levels of our business. To meet these goals, we are embedding inclusivity into everything we do
from recruitment to engagement, development and progression. We publish annual Gender and Ethnicity Pay
Gap reports.

Our inclusivity scorecard tracks our progress to being a truly inclusive employer, and our long-term
evolution of mind-set and behaviours. The scorecard tracks the following metrics:

**Representation within Senior Leadership Population** **2020** **2019**

Female . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31.5% 30.5%

We are also committed to ensuring the health and safety of all our employees, contractors, partners,
customers and members of the public. Our Health and Safety Policy is implemented through an externally
certificated Health and Safety Management System, BS ISO 45001:2018. Additionally, we have assessed our
framework against new standards including the Guidelines on Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields
issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, and continue to remain compliant.

Our expectations about operating in an ethical way extend to our supply chain. All of our suppliers are asked
to respect our business principles and to adhere to our supplier-facing ethical code. We conduct risk-based due
diligence to monitor compliance, such as by conducting desk-based checks of supplier processes and policies,
assessing evidence-based questionnaires via EcoVadis (a third-party rating platform that assesses social
responsibility and sustainability) and completing full on-site audits by trained sustainability auditors. We manage
the risks of modern slavery as part of our routine supply chain management process and hold specific modern
slavery risk management reviews where we identify heightened risks.

**SUSTAINABILITY OF THE VIRGIN MEDIA GROUP**

In this “Sustainability of the Virgin Media Group”, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company,” and “us” refers
to the Virgin Media Group, unless otherwise stated.

The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
The Virgin Media Group’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and
elsewhere in this offering memorandum, particularly in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and
“Risk Factors”.

**Overview**

The Virgin Media Group’s sustainability strategy (the “Meaningful Connections Plan”) was launched in
February 2021. This sustainability strategy seeks to utilise the influence of the Virgin Media brand, the skills and
capabilities of its employees and the strength of its network to promote positive societal and environmental
changes. The Virgin Media Group’s sustainability plan will focus on the following three core undertakings for
the next five years (the terms “we,” “our,” and “us” below refer to the Virgin Media Group and its consolidated
subsidiaries):

    - **Better for people: We are aiming to build a business where all our employees and customers feel a**
sense of belonging and that they are being supported. To support this aim, we are creating initiatives
that assist individuals from underrepresented communities to develop skills and access employment
opportunities.

    - **Better for communities: While digital connectivity has increased incrementally, loneliness and**
isolation continue to rise with it. We are looking to bring people and communities closer together by
harnessing the power of our network and brand to help 1.5 million people foster meaningful
connections within their communities by the end of 2025, and intend to focus on supporting unpaid
carers with their experiences of loneliness through a five year partnership with Carers UK. We consider
a connection as “meaningful” where it helps reduce loneliness and build a sense of community
belonging. We will also look to encourage local volunteering as a way of encouraging community
involvement.

    - **Better for the planet: In recognition of the growing effects of human industry on our planet, we are**
looking to shrink our own impact by committing to a zero waste and zero carbon future. We have set a
goal of reaching net zero carbon and zero waste across our operations by the end of 2025.

The Virgin Media Group’s plan is underpinned by:

    - **Better business: We are committed to running our business responsibly by looking beyond our**
proactive environmental and social impact programs and looking to foster positive social and
environmental changes in our quotidian business operations.

**Better for the Planet**

As a digital enabler that serves of customers millions across the U.K., our ultrafast connectivity has the
potential to significantly support the advancement of sustainability in our society by, for example, improving
conditions for home and remote working, promoting smart energy-saving technology in the home and supporting
intelligent transport systems.

We are also accelerating change within our own business and operations to make a zero carbon and zero
waste future a reality. Our goal is to achieve net zero carbon and zero waste operations by the end of 2025. We
have a strong track record of environmental performance, with continuous reductions in our carbon emissions
and improvements made on our waste disposal since 2014.

**_“Net zero” future—to achieve “net zero” operations by the end of 2025_**

The Virgin Media Group is committed to an approach that rewards both efficiency and investment in
renewable energy. To promote this approach we have set the following targets:

    - to reduce our operational carbon footprint by 25% from 2019 to end of 2025 by transitioning our fleet
to electrical vehicles, which would put us on track to support Liberty Global’s SBTi-approved target of
achieving a 50% operational carbon footprint energy reduction by 2030;

138


-----

    - to support investments in renewable energy and carbon reduction from the atmosphere by achieving
operations that are net zero by the end of 2025 through sourcing 100% of our electricity from
renewable energy and investing in carbon removal and offsetting schemes for our remaining carbon
emissions;

    - to work with our supply chain to reduce carbon emissions, with a particular focus on the lifecycle
impact of our products, in order to support Liberty Global’s SBTi-approved target to reduce its scope 3
emissions by 50% from 2019 to the end of 2030;

    - to support the decarbonization of the U.K. economy by providing connectivity to underpin a
low-carbon digital transformation, to support the roll out of on-street electric vehicle charging through
the “Liberty Charge” joint venture and to utilise our TV platform and partnerships to amplify and
encourage the streaming of engaging climate-related content; and

    - to abide by our operational commitment to implement science-based targets on climate in accordance
with the Responsible Media Form’s Media Climate Pact, that we became a signatory to in November
2020.

**_Nothing wasted—to become a “zero waste” operation by end of 2025_**

We understand our responsibility to address the waste that our operations produce, such as the waste that we
produce by providing millions of electrical products to customers’ homes, by managing logistical operations that
send equipment across the U.K., by continuously expanding our network cables, and by employing more than
11,000 employees across the U.K. We are committed to creating a more environmentally-friendly and circular
operational model where the materials that we use are re-used so that they never become waste. We expect to
save over 5,000 tonnes of waste by using recycled materials and by refurbishing and reusing returned customer
products. We have therefore set ourselves the following targets to be achieved by the end of 2025:

    - to reuse or recycle at least 95% of all waste created by our business operations;

    - for every broadband or TV product sent to our customers to either (i) contain at least 75% recycled
plastic content or (ii) be a refurbished product;

    - to reuse or recycle 100% of returned broadband and TV products;

    - to have 100% of customer packaging be recyclable and without containing any single use plastic; and

    - to work with our network expansion and field partners to set a target to reduce the amount of waste that
is produced by us when expanding our network cables.

**Climate Risk Assessment**

**_Regulations_**

One of the main regulations that we are subject to is the power standby regulation impacting our customer
premise equipment. This regulation impacts the quality of service we provide our customers. If not well managed
it can degrade the customer experience of our video, telephony, internet and other services. Another regulation
that we are subject is Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, which has now been transposed into U.K. law.
As a result of this regulation, there is an obligation for an audit of our energy consumption to be conducted. Such
audit is intended to identify energy saving opportunities which would further reduce energy consumption, the
associated greenhouse gas emissions, and save costs.

**_Acute Physical Risks_**

We consider our operations to be exposed to physical risks, largely related to the impact of weather-related
events. Similar to many North- and Western- European businesses we must be prepared to adapt to the growing
threats posed by storms, floods, hot summers and droughts and the associated increase in our insurance
premiums.

**_Chronic Physical Risks_**

Average temperatures are expected to rise due to climate change. Increasing temperatures and increases in
the frequency of extreme temperature events will have implications on the costs associated with running our
technical sites. Technical sites such as datacentres already require a significant amount of energy to cool the
equipment (up to 40% of the energy used in a technical site can be for operating the cooling systems). As
temperatures rise, so too will the amount of electricity needed to run our air conditioners for longer or more
frequently.

**REGULATION OF THE O2 GROUP**

The O2 Group’s operations are subject to sector-specific EU and U.K. telecommunications regulations, as
well as a variety of other regulations. The following section summarizes certain key regulations applicable to the
O2 Group’s operations.

For a discussion of the potential regulatory implications of the U.K.’s departure from the EU, see
“—Implications of the U.K.’s Departure from the EU” below.

**EU and U.K. Telecommunications Regulatory Framework**

**_Overview_**

The EU regulatory framework for telecommunications is the basis for the national telecommunications laws
in all EU Member States. The majority of the regime has remained in effect in the U.K. following its departure
from the EU. The EU regulatory framework contains provisions on the structure of national telecommunications
providers, as well as setting out general rules applicable to all providers of electronic communication networks
and services and specific rules that may be imposed by national regulatory authorities (“NRAs”), for example, on
operators with significant market power (“SMP”).

On December 17, 2018, the European Electronic Communications Code Directive (Directive 2018/1972)
(the “Communications Code Directive”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU, building on the scope
of and recasting the objectives and regulatory tools of the repealed Directives (as per article 125). The
Communications Code Directive had to be implemented by member states by December 21, 2020 (which fell
within the Transition Period for the U.K.). See “—Implications of the U.K.’s Departure from the EU” below.
Although many of the rules under the repealed Directives have been included in the Communications Code
Directive, there were significant changes required to be implemented by EU Member States. On December 2,
2020, the U.K. Government made the 2020 Electronic Communications and Wireless Telegraphy Regulation
(Amendment) (European Electronic Communications Code and EU Exit). These made amendments to the
Communications Act 2003 (as amended) in order to transpose the Communications Code Directive into U.K.
law. These include certain changes to implement the end-user rights provisions.

The Communications Code Directive is supplemented by the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications
Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) (“E-Privacy Directive”), which was implemented in the U.K. by the Privacy
and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended), setting out specific rules on data protection and
privacy concerns in the telecommunications sector. In January 2017, the EU Commission published a draft
E-Privacy Regulation which is intended to replace the E-Privacy Directive. Progress in negotiating the
Regulation has been slow and it is not clear when the E-Privacy Regulation will be agreed and the extent to
which it will be incorporated into U.K. law now the U.K. has departed the EU. In addition, and following the
U.K.’s departure from the EU, the retail roaming surcharge provisions (and wholesale price caps that underpin
them) no longer apply. See also “—Implications of the U.K.’s Departure from the EU” below.

The EU regulatory framework has been implemented into U.K. national law, primarily by the U.K.’s
Communications Act 2003 (as amended) (the “Communications Act”), which regulates all forms of
communications technology. Some of the key areas of the EU and U.K. regulatory framework which apply to the
O2 Group’s operations are discussed in more detail below.

Concurrently with Ofcom, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) also has jurisdiction
(pursuant to a memorandum of understanding) with respect to competition matters.

**_National regulatory authority in the U.K._**

The principal duties of Ofcom, the U.K.’s NRA for the communications sector, under the Communications
Act are to further the interests of citizens in relation to communication matters and further the interests of
consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promoting competition.

The Communications Act also requires Ofcom to take into account a host of other wide-ranging objectives
where these are relevant when carrying out its duties, such as promoting competition in relevant markets,
encouraging investment and innovation and encouraging the availability of high-speed data transfer services.

143


-----

Ofcom must also have regard to the regulatory principles of transparency, accountability, proportionality,
consistent and targeted action where needed and other principles of best regulatory practice. Ofcom’s
interpretation of these principles is that it should operate with a bias against intervention and should seek the least
intrusive regulatory mechanisms to achieve its policy objectives.

Governmental responsibility for electronic communication networks and services lies with DCMS. DCMS
therefore has responsibility for high-level policy formulation, implementation of the EU framework, legislative
reform, broadband policy and delivery and sponsorship of Ofcom.

**_Authorization regime_**

In the U.K., telecommunications operators can provide services without seeking prior authorization, or
obtaining a license, from Ofcom, subject to compliance with Ofcom’s General Conditions and any specific
conditions imposed by Ofcom. The authorization and licensing regime under the Communications Act is
technology neutral and makes no distinction between the regulation of fixed, mobile or satellite networks and
services. However, any operator wishing to utilize radio frequency spectrum is required to obtain a spectrum
license, in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006.

The General Conditions set out the day-to-day obligations that operators must comply with (although some
of the General Conditions only apply to certain types of operator, as described in the relevant condition).
Broadly, the General Conditions aim to protect the interests of end-users, secure service interoperability and
network access and secure the proper and effective functioning of telecommunications networks.

In addition to the General Conditions, individual operators may also be subject to further conditions
specifically imposed on them by Ofcom. There are four broad categories of specific conditions, as follows:

    - universal service conditions, which apply to those providers designated as universal service providers
by Ofcom (currently BT Group and KCOM Group in the U.K.);

    - access-related conditions, which may be issued by Ofcom to any operator that controls access to a
telecommunications network;

    - privileged supplier conditions, which apply to suppliers that have special or exclusive rights in relation
to the provision of non-communication services (i.e. services other than those consisting of, or
connected with, the provision of telecommunications networks and services); and

    - significant market power (“SMP”) conditions, which apply to any operator that Ofcom finds has SMP
in any one or more relevant economic market(s) within the overall telecommunications sector. The
SMP conditions aim to prevent any adverse effects that an operator’s SMP could have on the relevant
economic market(s). When assessing for the existence of SMP in a market, Ofcom must take due
account of the guidelines and recommendations provided by the European Commission and the Body
of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (“BEREC”). Ofcom is also required to notify
the European Commission and BEREC of its proposed measures to address market failures.

**_Spectrum licenses_**

Although no license or authorization is required to operate a telecommunications network or provide a
telecommunications service in the U.K., operators must obtain a license under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006
in order to use radio frequency spectrum. Spectrum licences are revocable under certain circumstances, including
for a breach of contract or for a number of spectrum efficiency reasons with provision of five years’ notice.

Spectrum licenses for an agreed block of spectrum can be awarded by auction or through negotiation with
Ofcom. However, in recent years, Ofcom’s policy has been to use auctions as the means of allocating spectrum.
In particular, new radio spectrum becoming available and suitable for mobile technologies (e.g., 3G, 4G and 5G
spectrum) has been allocated via spectrum auctions and use has been liberalized in some circumstances to enable
spectrum originally allocated for a specific use to also be used for other technologies. In 2018, Ofcom completed
a mobile spectrum auction pursuant to which licenses were awarded in 2.3 GHz and 3.4 GHz bands suitable for
4G and 5G deployment. In 2020 Telefonica UK Limited acquired 25 MHz of 2.6 GHz spectrum from EE. In
April 2021, Ofcom completed a mobile spectrum auction of the 700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8 GHz bands, where
Telefonica UK Limited acquired 20 MHz of paired 700 MHz spectrum and 40 MHz of 3.6 - 3.8 GHz spectrum.
As part of the same auction, the O2 Group agreed to trade holdings in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band with Vodafone in
order to allow it to defragment its spectrum and create a contiguous block of 80 MHz in the same band.

144


-----

**_Interconnection and access_**

Interconnection is the linking of telecommunications networks so that customers of one network can
communicate with customers of another network. It is important from a regulatory perspective for a number of
reasons, including: (a) elimination of the need for a customer to subscribe to multiple networks in order to be
able to communicate with all other customers; and (b) without regulation dominant operators could hinder or
eliminate competition by delaying interconnection, degrading the quality of interconnection, or charging high
prices for interconnection (often referred to as termination rates). All operators of public telecommunications
networks are required by the General Conditions to negotiate interconnection arrangements when requested.
Although technically this is an obligation to negotiate rather than to provide access, Ofcom has the power to
impose an access obligation on operators in the form of an SMP condition. All mobile network operators in the
U.K. (including the O2 Group) have been found by Ofcom to have SMP in the market for termination of calls on
their networks and are therefore subject to various SMP conditions. These conditions, set in 2018, impose price
controls and requirements to provide termination access on fair and reasonable terms. In recent years, Ofcom has
taken action to significantly reduce termination rates. In line with recommendations from the European
Commission from 2009 onwards, the cap on the mobile termination rate, being the rate charged by mobile
operators for terminating calls on their network, has been significantly reduced, from £0.00845 per minute on
April 1, 2014 to £0.00468 per minute from April 1, 2020. From June 1, 2021 there will be a further reduction of
the mobile termination rate to £0.00379 per minute.

**_End-user protection_**

In addition to general consumer protection law obligations, various provisions of the General Conditions
also provide specific protections to end-users (which includes residential and business consumers with up to ten
employees) in the telecommunications sector. Under the General Conditions, all telecommunications operators
must make available clear and up-to-date information on their prices and tariffs, and on their standard terms and
conditions in respect of access to and use of their publicly available telecommunications services. The General
Conditions also require certain information to be provided to end-users in contracts, at the point of sale and
directly at the end of those contracts and periodically thereafter, impose a maximum contract length of two years
and set conditions for termination of the contract.

In addition, every telecommunications operator in the U.K. must provide access to a dispute resolution
procedure scheme for their residential and small business customers. There are two Ofcom-approved dispute
resolution schemes (namely, Ombudsman Services and the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication
Scheme) to whom consumers may complain.

The implementation of the Communications Code Directive, with a final compliance deadline of
December 17, 2022, has enhanced the end-user protections set out in the General Conditions. These changes
include, but are not limited to, new information required to be provided in the customer’s contract and at the
point of sale, new switching and porting requirements, limitations on the length and form of linked split
contracts, and a lowered termination of contract thresholds for customers. With respect to a lowered termination
of contract thresholds for customers, the customer will be able to terminate their contract for any non-beneficial
contractual change that is not purely administrative in nature from June 2022.

**_End of Contract Notification and Annual Best Tariff Notifications_**

Ofcom has recently issued new regulatory requirements originating from the Communications Code
Directive that, effective from February 2020, obligate providers to alert residential and business customers who
are approaching the end of a minimum contract term to the fact that their contract period is coming to an end, any
changes to the price or services as a result, and to set out the options available to them.

Providers are also required to provide residential and business customers that are no longer subject to a
fixed minimum contract term with annual notifications of the best tariff that providers can offer. These annual
notifications will set out the fact that the customer is no longer within their fixed commitment period pursuant to
their contract, provide details of the service they are being provided and inform them of the best tariff options
available to them.

**_Number portability_**

All telecommunications operators are required by the General Conditions to facilitate the porting of
telephone numbers, including mobile telephone numbers. In order for customers to port their mobile telephone

145


-----

numbers to a new provider, customers can engage in the Auto-Switch process effective from July 1, 2019. The
Auto-Switch process enables customers with a single mobile number to simply text their existing provider which
will provide a “porting authorization code” (“PAC”) or “service termination authorization code” (“STAC”) as
requested within one minute. The customer is then responsible for giving the PAC or STAC to the new provider
which must arrange for the switch to be completed within one working day. Auto-Switch rules for customers
with multiple mobile phone numbers are slightly different, with longer timescales.

**_Net neutrality_**

Net neutrality is the principle that there should be no restriction on an individual’s access to the networks
that make up the infrastructure of the internet and no discrimination between the types and sources of data
traveling across such networks.

Ofcom has historically taken a light-touch attitude to net neutrality regulation in the U.K. A voluntary code
of practice has been adopted by the majority of significant telecommunications operators in the U.K. The code of
practice essentially accepts that traffic management was a necessary part of managing a communications network
while seeking to ensure that consumers were made aware of and understand any traffic management policies in
place before entering into contracts.

The EU Roaming Regulation codified the principle of net neutrality for the first time into EU law and has
been subsequently supplemented by the Open Internet Access Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/2120) as
implemented in the U.K. by the Open Internet Access (EU Regulation) Regulations 2016. These provisions
require that all traffic in the open internet must be treated equally by service providers, subject to strict and
clearly identified public interest exceptions. These exceptions include filtering spam and the blocking of
unlawful content or content containing viruses or malware. Any traffic management measures implemented
pursuant to these exceptions must be transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate, and they cannot be
maintained longer than necessary.

**_Access to land and infrastructure_**

The Electronic Communications Code (“ECC”) contained in the Communications Act contains provisions
that permit telecommunications operators to acquire interests in land for installing telecommunications
equipment. The Communications Act also sets out Ofcom’s duties in respect of the ECC.

The ECC grants certain rights enabling electronic communications network providers to install and maintain
electronic communications networks, whilst also making substantial changes to the valuation regime for the land
on which that network equipment is installed in moving to a “no scheme” approach. Under the ECC, operators
have rights to install and keep electronic communications apparatus on land. Generally, the ECC requires that
telecommunications operators secure the agreement of the land owner before installing such apparatus, but where
permission is not given by the land owner, a telecommunications operator can apply to a court for permission.
The ECC also provides new rights for telecommunications operators to upgrade and share infrastructure. These
rights are designed to assist future deployment of technology such as 5G. Additional, administrative changes in
the ECC to court processes also allow for faster dispute resolution, with the intent that disputes do not delay
construction and maintenance of communications infrastructure.

In addition to the ECC, rights and obligations that arise in respect of infrastructure are also governed by the
Communications (Access to Infrastructure) Regulations 2016 (“ATI Regulations”). The ATI Regulations
implement certain of the requirements of the EU directive on measures to reduce the cost of deploying highspeed electronic communications networks, with a particular focus on civil infrastructure works and use of
existing infrastructure. For example, the ATI Regulations provide for a number of rights for access seekers in
relation to physical infrastructure and civil works, including: a right to access information concerning existing
physical infrastructure on proportionate, non-discriminatory and transparent terms; a right to access in-building
physical infrastructure under fair and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, including price; and a right to
information concerning civil works under proportionate, non-discriminatory and transparent terms.

**Data Protection**

Together, the U.K. Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019 (the “U.K. GDPR”), the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”) and the Privacy and
Electronic Communications Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC, as amended as implemented in the U.K. by the Privacy

146


-----

and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (SI 2426/2003) (as amended) (“PECR”),
contain the current general legal framework for privacy and data protection in the U.K. The DPA supplements
the GDPR and also implements specific data protection provisions in relation to data processing by law
enforcement and intelligence services entities in the U.K.

The U.K. GDPR establishes seven general principles relating to processing of personal data which include:
(i) Lawfulness, fairness and transparency; (ii) Purpose limitation; (iii) Data minimization; (iv) Accuracy;
(v) Storage limitation; (vi) Integrity and confidentiality (security); and (vii) Accountability. The U.K. GDPR and
the DPA have implications for all telecommunications operators in their capacities as data controllers and data
processors and their customers, staff, partners and other stakeholders as data subjects. These implications
include, but are not limited to, the U.K. GDPR and the DPA:

    - requiring data controllers to provide more information to data subjects in their fair processing notices;

    - requiring consent from a data subject to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous
(involving a clear affirmative action on behalf of the data subject);

    - providing more transparency for data subjects with respect to the processing of their data, as well as
enhanced rights to rectify, delete, restrict or object to the data being processed;

    - requiring data controllers to notify the relevant regulatory authority of personal data breaches within 72
hours (provided that PECR imposes a more stringent 24-hour reporting obligation for
telecommunications providers); and

    - providing for two tiers of sanctions for violations, with maximum fines of up to €20 million or 4% of
annual worldwide turnover, whichever is greater.

PECR covers four main areas: (i) marketing by electronic means (including calls); (ii) the use of cookies
and similar technologies; (iii) the security of public electronic communication services; and (iv) the privacy of
individuals whilst using communication networks and services.

Telecommunications operators are also subject to requirements under the U.K. Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000 as amended by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 and The Data Retention and Acquisition
Regulations 2018 (“IPA”). The IPA regulates the powers of the Secretary of State and law enforcement bodies
with regard to any requests by them in respect of retention, disclosure and interception of communications and
other related data.

For example, the IPA provides that a telecommunications operator may be required by a Secretary of State
to retain certain communications data pursuant to the IPA for up to 12 months for the purposes of facilitating
disclosure of that communications data. The IPA includes safeguards to protect personal data and certain kinds of
communications data can only be disclosed for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime.

A Secretary of State (subject to judicial approval) may also issue lawful intercept warrants if information is
needed to detect or prevent serious crime, in the interests of national security or to safeguard the economic
wellbeing of the U.K. Interceptions can also lawfully take place without a warrant in specific circumstances, for
example, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties have consented to an interception. The
IPA also imposes a duty on telecommunications operators to assist by way of technical interference capability as
may be required to give effect to the requirements of a relevant warrant (again as approved by a Secretary of
State and a Judicial Commissioner).

**Financial Service Regulation**

The O2 Group’s regulated financial service activities carried out in the U.K. consist of insurance
distribution (carried out by Telefonica UK Limited and giffgaff) and consumer credit activities (carried out by
Telefonica UK Limited, giffgaff and Tesco Mobile). Telefonica UK Limited, giffgaff and Tesco Mobile are
authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) to carry out certain regulated activities under the
FSMA. This section sets out further details of the regulatory framework governing the regulated financial service
activities that Telefonica UK Limited, giffgaff and Tesco Mobile are permitted to undertake. However, it is
necessarily an overview and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary.

147


-----

**_Overview_**

_Financial Services and Markets Act 2000_

The cornerstone of the financial service regulatory regime in the U.K. is the FSMA. However, the
framework for supervision and regulation of banking and financial services in the U.K. has been, and continues
to be, heavily influenced by EU legislation. See, however, “—Implications of the U.K.’s Departure from the EU”
below.

The FSMA prohibits any person from carrying on a “regulated activity”, as defined in the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (the “RAO”), by way of business in the U.K. unless
that person is authorized or exempt under the FSMA (referred to as the “General Prohibition”). Regulated
activities under the RAO include, among others, insurance distribution and consumer credit activities. The FSMA
also prohibits financial promotions in the U.K. unless the promotion is issued or approved by an authorized
person or exempt from such requirements.

The Prudential Regulatory Authority (the “PRA”) and the FCA are the regulators in the U.K. responsible
for the authorization and supervision of regulated activities as defined in the RAO. Firms can be regulated by
either only the FCA or the FCA and PRA jointly, depending on the activities they carry on. Banks, building
societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms are regulated by both the PRA and the FCA. The
relevant O2 Group entities are authorized and regulated only by the FCA.

_The Financial Conduct Authority_

The FCA has responsibility for conduct of business regulation in relation to all authorized firms and the
prudential regulation of firms (including Telefonica UK Limited, giffgaff and Tesco Mobile) that are not
otherwise regulated by the PRA. The FCA also has market regulatory functions. Authorized firms must at all
times meet certain “threshold conditions” specified by the FSMA and set out in the FCA’s Handbook of Rules
and Guidance (“FCA Handbook”), which include having appropriate financial and non-financial resources and
being capable of effective supervision by the FCA.

When discharging its general functions of rule-making, preparing and issuing rules under the FSMA, giving
general guidance or determining general policy and principles, the FCA must, so far as is reasonably possible, act
in a way which is compatible with its strategic objective of ensuring that relevant markets function well, and
which advances one or more of its operational objectives of:

    - securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers (the consumer protection objective);

    - protecting and enhancing the integrity of the U.K. financial system (the integrity objective); and

    - in so far as is compatible with its consumer protection and integrity objectives, promoting effective
competition in the interests of consumers in financial markets.

_FCA Handbook_

The FSMA imposes an ongoing system of regulation and control on FCA-authorized firms. The detailed
rules and prudential standards set by the FCA are contained in various parts (known as “Sourcebooks”) of the
FCA’s Handbook. Once authorized, and in addition to continuing to meet the threshold conditions for
authorization, firms are obliged to comply with the applicable sections of the FCA Handbook, including the FCA
Principles for Businesses, which include conducting their business with due skill, care and diligence, treating
customers fairly and communicating with customers in a manner that is clear, fair and not misleading.
Sourcebooks which are of particular relevance to the O2 Group include the Systems and Controls Sourcebook,
the Prudential Sourcebook for Mortgage and Home Finance Firms and Insurance Intermediaries, the General
Prudential Sourcebook, the Conduct of Business Sourcebook, the Insurance Conduct of Business Sourcebook and
the Consumer Credit Sourcebook.

_Supervision and enforcement_

The FCA has extensive powers to supervise and intervene in the affairs of a firm authorized and regulated
under, or pursuant to, the FSMA. For example, the FCA can require firms to provide information or documents,
require the production of a report by a “skilled person” or formally investigate a firm and take a range of
disciplinary enforcement actions against the firm and certain individuals carrying out functions within the firm.
These actions include public censure, restitution and consumer redress exercises, potentially unlimited fines or

148


-----

sanctions, the award of compensation and, ultimately, revocation of permission (authorization) of a firm to carry
on regulated activities or revocation of permission of a person within that firm to perform a controlled function.

_Senior Managers & Certification Regime_

The FSMA gives the FCA powers and responsibilities over individuals carrying on certain roles within the
U.K. financial services industry. The Senior Managers & Certification Regime (“SMCR”) applies to firms which
are solo-regulated by the FCA, including Telefonica UK Limited, giffgaff and Tesco Mobile. The SMCR
requires firms to identify individuals performing certain senior management functions who must be approved by
the FCA as performing a “controlled function”. The SMCR requires responsibility for that function to be
accepted by the approved individual by means of a statement of responsibilities. Controlled functions include
both “governing functions”, such as chief executive, executive directors and chair, and “required functions”,
including compliance oversight, and money laundering reporting officer. A person must have regulatory approval
before they can perform any of these controlled functions and is subject to certain ongoing obligations for which
they are personally accountable to the FCA.

In addition to the approval of senior managers exercising controlled functions, the SMCR also required
individuals performing certain relevant roles to be certified as performing Certification Functions by March 31,
2021. Certification Functions are performed by people below senior manager level who are responsible for units
of the business that are considered to be material and to have a high-risk profile by the firm. Anyone performing
a senior management function, a Certification Function or a non-executive director role must be assessed for
fitness and propriety. Since March 31, 2021, the SMCR applies further conduct rules to employees of all levels
who carry out financial services activities in a firm. The FCA has wide-ranging powers under the FSMA to act
against any person who fails to satisfy the required standards of conduct or who ceases to be fit and proper,
including withdrawal of their approved status, granting a prohibition order, disciplinary action and/or fines.

_The Financial Ombudsman Service_

The FSMA established the Financial Ombudsman Service (the “FOS”) which determines complaints by
eligible complainants in relation to authorized financial services firms, consumer credit licensees and certain
other businesses in respect of activities and transactions under its jurisdiction, on the basis of what, in its opinion,
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The maximum level of money awarded by the FOS is £350,000 for
complaints received by the FOS which took place on or after April 1, 2019, £160, 000 for complaints received by
the FOS on or after April 1, 2019 but which took place before April 1, 2019, and £150,000 for any complaints
received by the FOS before April 1, 2019 plus interest and costs. The FOS may also make directions awards
which direct the relevant business to take steps which the FOS considers just and appropriate. Customers of the
regulated businesses within Telefonica UK Limited’s group will have access to the FOS.

_The Financial Services Compensation Scheme_

Eligible complainants may be able to seek compensation from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
where an authorized financial services firm is unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.

**_Insurance_**

The Insurance Distribution Directive came into force on 22 February 2016, repealing and replacing the
insurance mediation directive (2002/92/EC) (“IMD”). The IDD is designed to improve EU regulation in the
insurance market by ensuring a level playing field among all participants involved in the sale of insurance
products. The IDD extended the scope of the IMD to cover all participants in the sale of insurance products,
including the O2 Group. The IDD requires firms conducting insurance distribution activities to comply, among
other things, with certain organizational and conduct of business requirements. In the U.K. the majority of the
IDD provisions have been transposed by the FCA by way of amendments to the FCA Handbook.

The following insurance distribution activities are subject to the General Prohibition and the FSMA
authorization regime discussed above, unless such activity is otherwise subject to an exemption:

    - selling (or otherwise dealing in) contracts of insurance as agent;

    - arranging deals in, and making arrangements with a view to transactions in, contracts of insurance;

    - assisting in the administration and performance of a contract of insurance;

149


-----

    - advising on a contract of insurance; and

    - agreeing to carry on any of the above activities.

Telefonica UK Limited is authorized and currently undertakes insurance distribution activities in connection
with the provision of mobile and tablet insurance. In addition, the O2 Group currently has a legacy book of
automobile insurance customers under the “O2 Drive” proposition which is no longer open to new customers.
The O2 Group’s insurance activities are supplemented by a number of third parties who are each responsible for
their own authorization and are separately regulated by the FCA. The O2 Group has an oversight responsibility in
respect of these third parties.

**_Consumer credit_**

Consumer credit activities are subject to the General Prohibition and the FSMA authorization regime
discussed above. Relevant to the O2 Group, this includes the requirement to be authorized by the FCA, firms and
individuals falling within the SMCR regime being subject to supervision and enforcement by the FCA and
financial promotions restrictions.

Telefonica UK Limited undertakes consumer credit activities through the O2 Group’s O2 Refresh (including
Custom Plan) and Business Essentials offerings by entering into regulated credit agreements with the O2 Group’s
customers to finance the purchase of handsets, tablets and/or related mobile services.

As of April 1, 2014 the FCA has been responsible for the oversight and regulation of consumer credit firms
in the U.K. The regulatory framework comprises, in particular, the FSMA and its secondary legislation, retained
provisions in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (as amended, extended, or re-enacted from time to time) (“CCA”)
and related retained secondary legislation, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (“CRA”) and rules and guidance in the
FCA Handbook, including the Consumer Credit sourcebook (for the purposes of this section, collectively the
“Consumer Credit Regime”). However, this area of law is rapidly developing and new regulatory guidance and
case law as a result of new legislation can be expected. No assurance can be given that any changes in legislation,
guidance or case law in this area will not have a material adverse effect on the O2 Group’s businesses and
operations.

Under the Consumer Credit Regime, relevant “regulated activities” include credit broking and entering into
a “regulated credit agreement” as lender. The Consumer Credit Regime requires relevant entities of the O2 Group
to comply with detailed obligations covering areas such as financial promotions, customer communications, preand post-contractual requirements, responsible lending, cancellation, arrears, forbearance and debt advice. Where
a credit agreement is subject to the Consumer Credit Regime, it must contain certain prescribed information and
terms in a set form. Where these strict requirements are not met, such agreements may be unenforceable and
where this relates to agreements entered into before April 1, 2007, the agreements will be irredeemably
unenforceable. Agreements entered into on or after April 1, 2007 may be enforceable with an order of the court.
However, we cannot guarantee that such a court order can be obtained. Non-compliance with certain other
provisions of the CCA may also render customer agreements unenforceable against the borrower and result in
there being no obligation on the borrower to pay interest and charges during the period of non-compliance, and
require interest and charges that have already been collected to be refunded. Failure to provide certain postcontractual documentation may also render the agreement unenforceable during the period of non-compliance. In
addition, the FCA has placed increasing emphasis on compliance with the principle that a firm must pay due
regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly. The “Treating Customers Fairly” (“TCF”) obligation
requires FCA regulated firms, among other things, to demonstrate that senior management are taking
responsibility for ensuring that consumer outcomes relevant to the business are delivered through maintaining an
appropriate firm culture and good practice.

Non-compliance with the CCA and/or non-compliance with the FCA’s TCF or other principles may result in
an enforcement action by the FCA.

**_Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts_**

Furthermore, the O2 Group is also subject to unfair contract terms legislation, namely the Unfair Terms in
Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (the “UTCCRs”), which apply to business-to-consumer contracts entered
into prior to October 1, 2015, and the CRA, which replaced the UTCCRs and applies to business-to-consumer
contracts entered into or subject to a material amendment from October 1, 2015. Under the UTCCRs and the
CRA, a consumer may challenge a standard term in a contract on the basis that it is unfair and not binding on the

150


-----

consumer or the regulator may take enforcement action to stop the use of terms which are considered to be
unfair. The CRA is also applicable as of October 1, 2015, to consumer ‘notices’, such as variation of interest rate
under contracts such that consumer notices will be subject to the CRA in the same manner as consumer contracts.
These provisions apply to all types of contracts entered into by the O2 Group entities with consumers.

The UTCCRs will not generally affect terms which define the main subject matter of the contract, such as
the borrower’s obligation to repay the principal (provided that these terms are written in plain and intelligible
language and are drawn adequately to the consumer’s attention), but may affect terms that are not considered to
be terms which define the main subject matter of the contract, such as terms imposing default charges or
restricting refunds of fees if a customer cancels a service or settles early. For example, if a term permitting the
lender to impose a default charge is found to be unfair, the borrower will not be liable to pay the default charge
or, to the extent the borrower has paid it, will be able, as against the lender, to claim repayment of the default
charge paid or to set off the amount of the claim against the amount owing by the borrower under the loan or any
other loan agreement the borrower has taken with the lender. Any such non-recovery, claim or set-off may
adversely affect the business and operations of the O2 Group.

The CRA significantly reforms and consolidates consumer law in the U.K. The CRA has revoked the
UTCCRs and introduced a new regime for dealing with unfair contractual terms as follows:

    - Under Part 2 of the CRA an unfair term of a consumer contract (a contract between a trader and a
consumer) is not binding on a consumer (an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly
outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession). Additionally, an unfair notice is not
binding on a consumer, although a consumer may rely on the term or notice if the consumer chooses to
do so. A term will be unfair where, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes significant
imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.

    - Schedule 2 of the CRA contains an indicative and non-exhaustive “grey list” of terms of consumer
contracts that may be regarded as unfair. Notably, paragraph 11 lists “a term which has the object or
effect of enabling the trader to alter the terms of the contract unilaterally without a valid reason which
is specified in the contract”. Although paragraph 22 provides that this does not include a term by which
a supplier of financial services reserves the right to alter the rate of interest payable by or due to the
consumer, or the amount of other charges for financial services without notice where there is a valid
reason if the supplier is required to inform the consumer of the alteration at the earliest opportunity and
the consumer is free to dissolve the contract immediately.

Importantly, the CRA extends the application of the unfair contract terms regime to voluntary statements.
Statements made voluntarily by a firm or its employees that are taken into consideration by the consumer when
deciding whether to enter into a contract will now form part of the contract between the parties. This means that
oral statements made by sales teams and financial promotions may form part of consumer contracts.

Where a term of a consumer contract is “unfair” it will not bind the consumer. However, the remainder of
the contract will, so far as practicable, continue to have effect in every other respect. Where a term in a consumer
contract is susceptible to multiple different meanings, the meaning most favorable to the consumer will prevail. It
is the duty of the court to consider the fairness of any given term. This can be done even where neither of the
parties to proceedings has explicitly raised the issue of fairness.

The extremely broad and general wording of the CRA makes any assessment of the fairness of terms largely
subjective and makes it difficult to predict whether or not a term would be held by a court to be unfair. It is
therefore possible that any receivables covered by the CRA may also contain unfair terms which may result in
the possible unenforceability of the terms of the underlying loans.

The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPR”) implements the EU Unfair
Commercial Practices Directive and prohibits certain practices that are deemed “unfair” within the terms of the
CPR. Such practices include misleading actions or omissions, aggressive sales tactics and failures to comply with
the requirements of professional diligence. Possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract, in
relation to an underlying credit agreement, may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts to which such
agreements apply. The regulator may also take enforcement action.

**_COVID-19 Payment Deferrals and Forbearance Measures_**

The FCA published temporary guidance on April 9, 2020 for consumer credit firms offering personal loans
to consumers. The FCA subsequently published updated guidance in July, September and November 2020. This

151


-----

guidance applies in the exceptional circumstances arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the
financial situation of consumers of personal loans. It is intended to provide exceptional and rapid support to
consumers facing payment difficulties due to circumstances arising out of COVID-19.

The guidance falls into two categories:

_Payment Deferral Guidance_

From April 2020 to March 31, 2021, FCA regulated companies were required to have schemes in place to
provide customers financially impacted by COVID-19 with emergency relief on their loan payments.

Where a customer was experiencing or reasonably expected to experience payment difficulties as a result of
circumstances relating to COVID-19, the customer was entitled to request and we were obliged to grant a
“payment deferral” of up to three months (unless a deferral was obviously not in the customer’s best interests). A
payment deferral could be extended to a maximum of 6 months, at the customer’s request. The mandatory
scheme closed to new deferrals on March 31 and all deferrals should end by July 31, 2021. After a payment
deferral, the customer is still liable to pay the sums deferred.

_Tailored Support Guidance (“TSG”)_

From October 2020, the Payment Deferral Guidance was supplemented by this additional TSG guidance.
The TSG requires FCA regulated firms like Telefonica UK Limited to offer consumer credit customers affected
by COVID-19 a range of payment support options, to help them manage their loan payments while their finances
are disrupted by the pandemic. The FCA also set out a number of “customer outcomes” which Telefonica UK
Limited and other FCA regulated companies are expected to achieve through their implementation of the TSG.

Between October 2020 and March 2021, the Payment Deferral Guidance and TSG ran alongside each other,
whereas after March 2021, only the TSG remains in place.

Telefonica UK Limited has implemented schemes and processes to ensure adherence with the Payment
Deferral Guidance and TSG. Since April 2020, around 50,000 Telefonica UK Limited customers have been
supported by payment deferrals.

Extended duration of payment deferrals as well as quantum of such payments and other forbearance
measures may adversely affect the relevant entities of the O2 Group and may, among other things, result in a
reduction of funds available to them and affect business performance. However, an internal review of Telefonica
UK Limited found that there was no strong evidence that taking a deferral significantly affected the likelihood of
a customer defaulting on their payments in the longer term. Although Telefonica UK Limited’s range of supports
includes additional debt write-offs, only around £20,000 has been written off in relation to our implementation of
the FCA COVID-19 guidance.

There is no guarantee that the FCA, or other U.K. Government or regulatory bodies, will not take further
steps in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.K., including further amending and extending the scope of
the above guidance. However, (after two previous extensions) the FCA did not extend the Payment Deferral
Guidance beyond March 31, 2021 and the FCA has made no statement since to indicate it intends to extend the
existing TSG or reinstate the Payment Deferral Guidance.

**Implications of the U.K.’s Departure from the EU**

The Agreement on the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU came into effect on January 31, 2020 (the
“Withdrawal Agreement”), and implemented the transition period for exit until December 31, 2020. During the
transition period, the U.K. continued to be subject to EU law and regulation. However, it did not continue to do
so following expiry of the transition period upon which the terms of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“EUWA”) as supplemented by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 applied. EUWA repeals
legislation governing the relationship of the U.K. with the EU such as the European Communities Act 1972 but
contains a number of savings for existing EU law such that many provisions of EU law remain effective in the
U.K. following the expiry of the transition period. The intention behind EUWA is that major changes to policy or
the establishment of new legal frameworks in the U.K. will be introduced in separate legislation.

The EU regulatory framework for telecommunications has been implemented into national legislation in the
U.K. mainly via the Communications Act. Therefore, the expiration of the transition period and the U.K.’s exit

152


-----

from the EU did not have an immediate impact on the Communications Act. However, following the U.K.’s exit
from the EU, the U.K. Government has scope to repeal or amend the Communications Act without being limited
by the requirements of the relevant EU directives, which could lead not only to substantive changes to the
regulatory framework to which the O2 Group must adhere but also to a divergence in U.K. and EU regulation in
the telecommunications sector in the medium to long term.

Following the U.K.’s departure from the EU, the EU Roaming Regulation, which provided for wholesale
and retail price caps, no longer applies in the U.K. However, the U.K. Government has retained the obligation on
mobile operators to apply a cap of £45 on mobile data usage while abroad, unless the customer actively opts to
continue paying for additional data. Consequently, the O2 Group is planning to negotiate commercial roaming
surcharges with other operators in Europe rather than relying on regulatory requirements to set roaming
surcharges. With respect to net neutrality, the U.K. Government has enacted the Open Internet Access
(Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 at the U.K. domestic level to preserve open internet access after
the U.K.’s exit from the EU.

Since the beginning of 2021, the O2 Group is required to comply with the U.K. GDPR, which, together with
the amended U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in U.K. national law (subject to some
amendments). The U.K. GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g., fines up to the greater of £17.5 million or
4% of global turnover, which could result in duplicate regulatory action and fines in the U.K. and the EU.
Despite the transition period expiring at the end of 2020, the relationship between the U.K. and the EU in relation
to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example whether the U.K. will follow the guidance
from the EU regarding international transfers and the Schrems II decision, and the role of the U.K. Information
Commissioner’s Office following the end of the transition period. The U.K. awaits further clarity regarding when
an Adequacy Decision may be formally granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU
member states to the U.K. Presently, the European Commission has provided a draft Adequacy Decision which is
pending approval by the European Data Protection Board. These changes will lead to additional costs and
increase our overall risk exposure.

The U.K.’s exit from the EU may also have a material impact on the financial services sector in the U.K.,
including the provision of consumer credit activities and insurance distribution. The nature and extent of that
impact, and the specific consequences for the insurance distribution and consumer credit activities the O2 Group
carries out, will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and the U.K. In March 2021, the EU and
the U.K. agreed to create a Joint EU-U.K. Financial Regulatory Forum to consider regulation for the sector. The
O2 Group does not presently anticipate a material change to the rules for its FCA regulated products. Currently
applicable financial regulation, including directly applicable EU legislation, continues to apply during the
transition period until any changes are made by the U.K. Government.

Although regulation is generally moving towards greater harmonization at the EU level, including proposals
such as the Digital Single Market which seeks to remove obstacles to the creation of a single, advanced EU
digital market and to provide better access for consumers and businesses to online e-goods and services across
the EU, potential future change in regulation at the U.K. domestic level not only introduces the possibility of
changes in the substance of the material regulation to which the O2 Group is subject, but also could lead to
uncertainty for operators such as the O2 Group as to how they will be regulated.

**Types of Mobile Telecommunications Service Providers**

Mobile telecommunications services in the U.K. are generally provided by two broad categories of
operators: MNOs, which hold licenses to use radio frequency spectrum and operate (either solely or in part
through network sharing arrangements with other MNOs) full physical mobile telecommunications networks
(comprised of mobile sites linked to a core network by backhaul connections), and MVNOs, which do not
operate full physical mobile networks but which have contracted to access the mobile networks of an MNO so as
to provide mobile telecommunications services to their subscribers.

As at the date of this offering memorandum, there are four MNOs active in the U.K. mobile
telecommunications market:

    - EE (owned by BT Group plc, a large U.K. multinational provider of fixed-line telephony, broadband
internet, television, mobile telephony and IT services. BT/EE operate under the EE, Plusent and BT
Mobile brands);

    - the O2 Group (trading both as O2 and through its sub-brand giffgaff);

    - Vodafone (trading both as Vodafone and through its sub-brands Talk Mobile and VOXI); and

    - Three (the brand name of Hutchison 3G UK Limited, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings. Three
operates under the 3, Smarty and Superdrug Mobile brands).

In addition to the four established MNOs described above, a significant number of MVNOs are active in the
U.K. mobile telecommunications market. As at the date of this offering memorandum, the largest MVNOs

154


-----

included Tesco Mobile (the 50:50 joint venture between the O2 Group and Tesco), Virgin Mobile, Lycamobile,
Lebara Mobile, TalkTalk, Sky Mobile (launched by Sky) and iD Mobile (launched by Dixons Carphone). The O2
Group acts as a wholesale provider to a number of MVNOs, including Tesco Mobile, Lycamobile, TalkTalk and
Sky. See “Business of the O2 Group—Products and Services—giffgaff, Tesco Mobile and Wholesale Partners”.

**Payment models**

The two basic payment models offered by U.K. mobile telecommunications providers are post-pay and
pre-pay. The post-pay model is typically characterized by a minimum-term contract under which the customer
pays a set monthly fee in arrears for voice, messaging and data usage up to certain limits, with additional charges
for usage outside these limits and for any other charges, such as roaming charges. Customers who purchase a
handset as part of the post-pay model are typically restricted to using the mobile service provider until their
contract with that mobile service provider expires. The post-pay model also frequently involves subsidies where
the upfront cost of a handset to the customer is reduced at the beginning of the minimum-term contract period.
The pre-pay model is typically characterized by no minimum-term contract, no set monthly fee and limited or no
subsidies for handsets. The post-pay model has increased in significance in recent years, while the pre-pay model
has been in gradual decline. The number of post-pay mobile subscriptions in the U.K. increased to 62.6 million
in 2020 from 58.7 million in 2018, a compound annual growth rate of 3.2%, whereas pre-pay mobile
subscriptions decreased to 23.2 million in 2020 from 26.3 million in 2018, a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 6.1% (source: Analysys Mason).

Historically, post-pay and pre-pay were established as distinct consumer segment descriptors, in part based
on the limitations of different billing platforms. However, as consumer behavior and demands have changed and
as billing platforms have evolved, the distinction between post-pay and pre-pay has become less clear. For
example, “SIMO” contracts, pursuant to which an operator provides a SIM card but does not provide a handset
(as traditionally would have been the case for a post-pay subscription), have become more prevalent.

**Trends in the U.K. mobile telecommunications market**

**_Mobile data volumes_**

Total mobile data volumes in the U.K. have grown sharply in recent years, increasing to 4,271 petabytes in
2020 from 533 petabytes in 2014, a compound annual growth rate of 41.5% (source: Analysys Mason). The
increase in mobile data volumes primarily reflects increased adoption of smartphones and other advanced small
screen devices, such as tablets, as well as the roll-out of 4G and 5G mobile networks, which provide significantly
higher bandwidth than previous technologies and support continued growth of video and music streaming, video
calls, cloud-based applications, social media sites and other services and applications (including connectivity
with the IoT) that benefit from the availability of higher bandwidth. Mobile data volumes are expected to
continue to grow rapidly and to increase to 29,330 petabytes in 2025, a projected compound annual growth rate
of 47.0% from 2020 (source: Analysys Mason), as the relevant underlying trends continue. Accordingly, the
monetization of mobile data and managing network capacity levels are expected to be key strategic priorities for
operators in the U.K. mobile telecommunications market, including the O2 Group.

**_The Internet of Things_**

The Internet of Things (sometimes referred to as “machine-to-machine” or “M2M”) (“IoT”) is expected to
become an increasingly important feature of the U.K. mobile telecommunications market over the coming years.
The IoT is expected to grow to potentially include hundreds of millions of devices in the U.K., bringing potential
benefits to consumers and businesses across a number of sectors such as transport, healthcare and energy. While
existing 4G mobile networks are capable of supporting many emerging IoT applications, the development of the
IoT is expected to be an additional factor that increases usage of mobile data and the importance of a strong 5G
offering.

**_Digital services and products_**

In recent years a number of operators have started to bundle additional digital services and products with
their mobile service offerings in an effort to improve customer loyalty and increase revenue from their customer
bases. Such digital services and products have included video, music, security and productivity services.

155


-----

**_Convergence_**

A number of operators have adopted a convergence strategy for the consumer segment by seeking to bundle
mobile telecommunications services together with one or more fixed telecommunications services, including
fixed-line telephony, fixed-line broadband internet and television content, such that customers can purchase a
collection of telecommunications services from a single provider. Such “multi-play” offerings may provide
operators with additional cross-selling opportunities and certain cost advantages such as shared marketing costs.

**_Developments in 4G and 5G mobile networks_**

4G mobile networks have continued to evolve with advances in radio technology, ultimately delivering
higher speeds than previously available through, for example, the utilization of higher frequency spectrum. As of
September 2020, 69% of the U.K. landmass had high-quality 4G coverage from all four MNOs, that area
incorporating 97.5% of premises in the U.K (source: Ofcom Connected Nations Report 2020). Through the
Shared Rural Network, the four MNOs, including the O2 Group, are each conditionally committed to delivering
high-quality 4G geographic coverage to at least 90% of the U.K. landmass by January 2027.

In addition, the roll-out of 5G mobile networks began in October 2019 and these are expected to be capable
of delivering even faster data speeds with the potential to support very high demand uses (including streaming
high-definition video) and network traffic in busy areas such as city centers. The technical capabilities of the 5G
radio and core are compliant with 3GPP standards which dictate the enhanced performance potential. Moreover,
the 5G mobile capability has the potential to revolutionize many industries across, for example, mobility,
healthcare, manufacturing and retail sectors. Healthcare could benefit from lower latency capabilities to deliver
accurate online consultations or treatments in a moving ambulance and from low power, highly dense sensor
networks that could transform monitoring of chronic conditions. Manufacturing can run highly precise operations
using low-latency and private 5G networks. A growing number of factories will incorporate features such as
automated guided vehicles and computer-vision-enhanced bin picking and quality control. Such functions require
the high speeds and ultra-low latency that high-band 5G networks provide. Retailers can use sensors and trackers
to better manage inventory, improve warehouse operations, and coordinate along the supply chain. Enhanced
connectivity can support frictionless in-store experiences and, for example, eliminate checkout processes or add
augmented reality for better product information. Mobility improvements from enhanced connectivity,
particularly latency, can enable the transition to enhanced driver aids including vehicle-to-vehicle
communication to reduce collisions and improve traffic flow and facilitate preventative maintenance.

**_Mobile Substitution of Fixed Telephony_**

Mobile telephony has increasingly substituted fixed-line telephony in recent years, with total fixed voice
call minutes in the U.K. declining to 38.97 billion minutes in 2019 from 93.17 billion minutes in 2013, a
compound annual growth rate of (13.52)% (source: Ofcom Communications Market Report 2020).

**_Over-the-top applications_**

In recent years traditional voice and messaging services have experienced increased competition from
non-traditional voice and video call services based on voice-over-internet-protocol technologies and other
over-the-top (“OTT”) applications, such as Skype, Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google
Hangouts and Zoom. These OTT applications have also received a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic in
providing a face-to-face offering. Traditional voice calls are carried over a circuit switched network that allocates
a dedicated circuit to each call. Internet protocol data networks split data into packets which are then sent
individually across the network. As OTT voice and video calls are routed over the open internet, OTT providers
are more isolated from costs relating to running the internet protocol data network over which such calls are
transmitted (these are incurred by the network operator and generally passed on to the end users as part of their
access charges). OTT applications, which are often free of charge and accessible via smartphones, tablets and
other devices, can act as a substitute for traditional MNO voice and messaging services. However, there has also
been a market shift toward larger usage allowances being offered by U.K. mobile telecommunications providers,
thereby reducing the cost-saving opportunity that OTT applications may have otherwise presented to many
customers. Accordingly, traditional voice and messaging services are expected to remain significant features of
the U.K. mobile telecommunications market in the short-to-medium term, even while mobile data continues to
increase in importance. See “—Mobile data volumes” above.

**Spectrum**

Ofcom is the U.K. regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting, telecommunications and postal
industries and as such is responsible for, inter alia, managing civilian use of radio spectrum in the U.K. See
“Regulation of the O2 Group”. Ofcom conducts periodic spectrum auctions pursuant to which operators can bid
for spectrum. Following a spectrum auction, winning bidders are issued with licenses to use the relevant
spectrum, subject to any license conditions.

In 2018, Ofcom completed a mobile spectrum auction pursuant to which EE, Vodafone, the O2 Group,
Three and a subsidiary of BT Group were awarded licenses in 2.3 GHz and 3.4 GHz bands which are suitable for
4G and 5G deployment.

In 2020, Telefonica UK Limited acquired 25 MHz of 2.6 GHz spectrum from EE.

In April 2021, Ofcom completed a mobile spectrum auction of the 700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8 GHz bands both
suitable for 4G and 5G deployment, pursuant to which Telefonica UK Limited acquired 20 MHz of paired
700 MHz spectrum and 40 MHz of 3.6 - 3.8 GHz spectrum. As part of the same auction, Telefonica UK Limited
agreed to trade holdings in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band with Vodafone in order to allow it to defragment its spectrum,
and create a contiguous block of 80 MHz in the same band.

and the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the VM Credit Facility and the Existing VM Senior
Secured Notes and the New Group Intercreditor Agreement (which takes effect by way of amendment and
restatement of the Group Intercreditor Deed) will establish the relative rights of the VM Credit Facility Lenders,
the holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors under other financing arrangements of
the Group.

Definitions of certain terms used in this “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds” may be found below under
the headings “—Group Intercreditor Deed—Certain Definitions”, “—High Yield Intercreditor Deed—Certain
_Definitions” and “—New Group Intercreditor Agreement—Certain Definitions”. The summaries set forth below_
do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual deeds, copies of which
will be made available by us upon request. See “Listing and General Information”. The form of the New Group
Intercreditor Agreement is attached as Annex C to this offering memorandum.

**Group Intercreditor Deed**

The Group Intercreditor Deed governs the relationship among the Senior Liabilities (as described below),
including the VM Credit Facility, the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes, secured hedge counterparties and
certain intra-group debtors and creditors.

**_Priorities_**

The Group Intercreditor Deed provides that the Senior Liabilities and the secured hedging liabilities rank
_pari passu without any priority among themselves but senior to certain intra-group liabilities._

**_Senior Liabilities_**

For purposes of the Group Intercreditor Deed, the “Senior Liabilities” include all of the present and future
obligations and liabilities (excluding hedging liabilities) of the Group to the Senior Finance Parties under or in
connection with the Senior Finance Documents, including any New Senior Liabilities, together with any related
additional liabilities owed to the Senior Finance Parties and together also with all costs, charges and expenses
incurred by each of the Senior Finance Parties in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of
its rights under the Senior Finance Documents.

VMIH may at any time designate liabilities under any credit facility or other financial accommodation as
“New Senior Liabilities” under the Group Intercreditor Deed (whether to refinance, replace or increase any
existing Senior Liabilities or to constitute any new financial accommodation), provided that the incurrence of
such liabilities complies with the terms of the VM Credit Facility (or, upon its discharge in full, the Designated
Refinancing Facilities Agreement). VMIH will designate the New Finco Facilities as New Senior Liabilities on
the Issue Date upon which designation they will constitute Senior Liabilities for all purposes under the Group
Intercreditor Deed.

**_Instructing Party_**

The Instructing Party which controls, among other things, voting and enforcement with respect to and under
the Group Intercreditor Deed is defined, for as long as any of the Senior Liabilities are outstanding, as:

(i) prior to an Enforcement Control Event, the Instructing Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility or,
upon its discharge in full, the Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement); or

(ii) upon an Enforcement Control Event, the Senior Finance Parties representing a majority of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount and undrawn un-cancelled commitments under the Senior
Finance Documents at the relevant date of determination.

For the definition of “Instructing Group” under the VM Credit Facility, see “Description of the VM Credit
_Facility and the Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—Instructing Group”._

**_Enforcement_**

The Group Intercreditor Deed sets forth the relative rights of, among other things, the Group’s creditors in
relation to the Senior Liabilities to enforce the security interests granted by the Group. The Issuer (as a VM
Credit Facility Lender), at all times has the right, subject to the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the
relevant finance documents, to, among other things:

    - demand payment of interest or principal;

    - declare prematurely due or accelerate any interest or principal;

    - perfect and preserve rights in any security interest;

    - institute legal proceedings under the terms of the Senior Finance Documents (other than the Security
Documents) for collection of amounts owing thereunder, to seek injunctive relief against any actual or
putative breaches of any Senior Finance Documents or for specific performance or similar remedies or
assert rights of an unsecured creditor, including arising under any insolvency event;

    - file any necessary or responsive pleadings in response to any person objecting or seeking disallowance
of their rights in the security; and

    - file claims or statements of interest with respect to the Senior Liabilities upon the occurrence of any
insolvency event.

Any of the following additional enforcement actions proposed to be taken by the Issuer would require the
consent of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative):

    - exercise or seek to exercise any right to crystallize any floating charge created pursuant to the Security
Documents;

    - exercise or seek to exercise any right to enforce any encumbrance created pursuant to the Security
Documents;

    - exercise or seek to exercise the remedy of foreclosure in respect of any asset subject to any
encumbrance created pursuant to the Security Documents;

    - petition for, initiate or support to take, or join with any person in commencing to take, any steps with a
view to any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, administration or dissolution proceedings or any
voluntary arrangements for the benefit of creditors or any similar proceedings involving an obligor;

    - contest or support any other person in contesting, the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of
all or any part of the security granted pursuant to the Security Documents or the validity or
enforceability of any of the Senior Liabilities or the secured hedging liabilities or of the priorities,
rights or duties established by the Group Intercreditor Deed;

    - contest, protest or object to any enforcement or foreclosure proceeding or action or any other rights and
remedies relating to the security granted pursuant to the Security Documents brought by the VM Credit
Facility Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders or object to the forbearance by the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders from bringing or pursuing any enforcement or foreclosure
proceeding or action or otherwise exercise any right of remedies relating to the security; or

    - take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or
delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the security by the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee.

159


-----

The secured hedge counterparties, holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain intra-group
creditors are also subject to certain limitations on taking enforcement action under the Group Intercreditor Deed
as well as certain limitations on receiving payments and other distributions in respect of the secured hedging
liabilities and intra-group liabilities.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee will act in relation to the security interests in accordance with the
instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative). Before giving any instructions to the
VM Credit Facility Security Trustee to enforce any security interests, the relevant agent or representative acting
for the Instructing Group is required to consult with the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee in good faith, with a
view to coordinating their actions, for a period of 45 days or such shorter period as the relevant agent may
determine. The relevant agent or representative is not required to so consult with the VM Credit Facility Security
Trustee if:

    - the security interest has become enforceable as a result of (i) an insolvency event, (ii) a non-payment
event of default under the VM Credit Facility or any equivalent provisions under any other Senior
Finance Document, or (iii) any other party taking any enforcement action against an obligor; and

    - the relevant agent determines in good faith that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the
commencement of enforcement of the security interest could reasonably be expected to adversely
impact in any material respect the ability to enforce any of the security interests or the realization
proceeds of any enforcement of the security interests.

The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee will incur no liability to any Priority Creditor in exercising in good
faith any discretion with respect to the enforcement of security interests or if it acts on the advice of a reputable
independent investment bank. The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee and the VM Credit Facility Agent will be
required to use reasonable efforts to consult with any authorized representative or any steering committee or
other representative in respect of any series of Additional Senior Liabilities, which would include, prior to the
any Enforcement Control Event, the Issuer prior to taking any enforcement action and provide on a regular basis
relevant information on the status of any ongoing enforcement action.

**_Release of Collateral_**

If any assets are sold or otherwise disposed of (i) by (or on behalf of) the VM Credit Facility Security
Trustee, (ii) as a result of a sale by an administrator or liquidator, or (iii) by an obligor at the request of the VM
Credit Facility Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Party (or its
relevant agent or representative)), in each case, of the foregoing, either as a result of the taking of an enforcement
action or a disposal by an obligor after any enforcement action, the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee is
authorized to release those assets from the collateral and is authorized to execute, without any further authority
by any Priority Creditor,

    - any release of the collateral or any other claim over that asset and to issue any certificates of
non-crystallization of any floating charge that may, in the absolute discretion of the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee, be considered necessary or desirable;

    - if the asset which is disposed of consists of all of the shares in the capital of an obligor or any holding
company or subsidiary of that obligor, any release of that obligor or holding company or subsidiary
from all liabilities it may have to any Priority Creditor or other obligor and a release of any security
interest granted by that obligor or holding company or subsidiary over any of its assets; and

    - if the asset which is disposed of consists of all of the shares in the capital of an obligor or any holding
company or subsidiary of that obligor and if the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee wishes to dispose
of any liabilities owed by that obligor, any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities on
behalf of the relevant Priority Creditors, obligors or agents (with the proceeds thereof being applied as
if they were the proceeds of enforcement of the collateral) provided that the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee takes reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions
(though the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee has no obligation to postpone any disposal in order to
achieve a higher price). No guarantees of any notes issued by the VM Senior Notes Issuer, the VM
Secured Notes Issuer, VMIH, any financing subsidiary, or any issuer of senior secured notes from time
to time under an indenture may be disposed of pursuant to this paragraph (although such guarantees
may be released pursuant to the preceding paragraph).

160


-----

No liabilities of the VM Senior Notes Issuer, the VM Secured Notes Issuer, VMIH, any financing subsidiary
or any issuer of senior secured notes from time to time, in each case, in its capacity as a borrower or issuer under
any Senior Finance Documents, may be disposed of pursuant to the foregoing or released pursuant to the
foregoing. Any asset which is disposed of is released from the claims of all Priority Creditors and the proceeds of
such disposal will be applied in accordance with “—General Application of Proceeds” below.

**_Security Trustee Authorization_**

Subject to the terms of the Senior Finance Documents, at any time after an event of default has occurred and
is continuing under the VM Credit Facility or any of the other Senior Finance Documents, the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee may take such steps as it deems necessary or advisable:

    - to perfect or enforce any of the security interests granted in its favor;

    - to effect any disposal or realization or enforcement of any of the liabilities of the obligors (including by
any acceleration thereof);

    - to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable in
relation to any of the liabilities of the obligors; or

    - otherwise to give effect to the intent of the Group Intercreditor Deed.

The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee may refrain from enforcing the security interests unless and until
instructed to do so by the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) and no Priority Creditor (or its
authorized representative) is permitted to contest or object to any enforcement action taken by the VM Credit
Facility Security Trustee on the instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative). No
party is permitted to take or receive any collateral or any proceeds of any collateral in connection with the
exercise of any right or remedy (including set off) with respect to the collateral other than the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee acting on the instructions of the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) in
accordance with the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed.

The VM Credit Facility Security Trustee has the exclusive right (and the Instructing Party (or its relevant
agent or representative) has the exclusive right to instruct the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee) to enforce
rights, exercise remedies (including set-off) and make determinations regarding the release, disposition, or
restrictions with respect to the security and in exercising such rights and remedies, the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee and the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) may enforce the provisions of
the Senior Finance Documents and exercise the remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they
may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion.

Subject to “—Manner of Enforcement” below, if the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or
representative) instructs the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee to enforce the security, it may do so in such
manner as it deems fit, having regard solely to the interests of the Beneficiaries. Neither the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee, the relevant agent acting for the Instructing Group nor any other Senior Finance Party is
responsible to any other creditor for any failure to enforce or to maximize the proceeds of any enforcement, and
may cease any such enforcement at any time.

**_Manner of Enforcement_**

If the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee does enforce any of the security interests it may do so in such
manner as it sees fit solely having regard to the interest of the Beneficiaries. The VM Credit Facility Security
Trustee is not responsible to any Beneficiary for any failure to enforce nor to maximize the proceeds of any
enforcement, and may cease any such enforcement at any time.

Neither the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative) instructing the VM Credit Facility
Security Trustee, nor the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee itself, is required to take into account the sharing of
proceeds provision in the Group Intercreditor Deed when determining the manner of enforcement (and which
security to enforce) and, if it is determined to enforce any direct security over shares (other than shares in VMIH
and/or VMIL), the Instructing Party (or its relevant agent or representative, as the case may be) must in good
faith believe that doing so will result in more aggregate proceeds resulting from enforcement of security
(disregarding the sharing of proceeds provisions in the Group Intercreditor Deed) than would be realized solely
from enforcing direct security over shares in VMIH and/or VMIL alone.

161


-----

**_Standstill Payments_**

Following an event of default under the VM Credit Facility or any other Senior Finance Document all
payments received by any Senior Finance Party to enter into any standstill agreement or other agreement to delay
the taking of any enforcement action is required to be shared among all the Senior Finance Parties pro rata based
on the aggregate outstanding principal amount and undrawn commitments with respect to the Senior Liabilities
held by such Senior Finance Party.

**_No New Encumbrances_**

For so long as any Senior Liabilities are outstanding, no obligor is permitted to grant or permit any
additional encumbrances, or take any action to perfect any additional encumbrances, on any asset or property to
secure any series of Senior Liabilities unless it has also granted an encumbrance on such asset or property to
secure all of the other series of Senior Liabilities to the extent legally possible and without undue burden on the
group (excluding limitations or exclusions in the collateral provided to any series pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series) and has taken all actions to perfect such encumbrances. To
the extent that the foregoing is not complied with, any amounts received by any Senior Finance Party in
contravention of the foregoing is required to be paid to the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee for the benefit of
the Priority Creditors for application pursuant to and in accordance with “—General Application of Proceeds”
below.

**_General Application of Proceeds_**

Subject to the rights of any preferential creditor and notwithstanding the terms of the Security Documents,
the net proceeds of enforcement of the collateral will be paid to the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee for the
benefit of the Priority Creditors pursuant to the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and will be applied by the
VM Credit Facility Security Trustee (or any receiver on its behalf) in the following order of priority, in each
case, until such amounts have been repaid and discharged in full:

FIRST, in or towards payment of a sum equivalent to the aggregate of any amounts payable to the VM
Credit Facility Security Trustee under the Senior Finance Documents, to the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee;

SECOND, in or towards payment of any fees, expenses, costs or commissions payable to any Senior
Finance Party under any Senior Finance Document;

THIRD, in or towards payment of a sum equivalent to the aggregate of the Senior Liabilities and the secured
hedging liabilities, to the Second Beneficiaries respectively, which sum will (if insufficient to discharge the same
in full) be paid to the Second Beneficiaries on a pro rata basis without any priority among themselves; and

FOURTH, in payment to the relevant obligor(s) or other person(s) entitled thereto.

To the extent that (i) the net proceeds of any enforcement of collateral and (ii) any other recoveries and/or
proceeds from any obligor (other than in the case of sub-paragraph (ii), such other recoveries and/or proceeds
from the VM Senior Notes Issuer and VMIH) are to be applied in accordance with the foregoing, any such
proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with the foregoing until all of the Senior Liabilities and the
secured hedging liabilities have been discharged in full.

To the extent that a security interest has not been granted in favor of any series of Senior Liabilities incurred
after October 30, 2009 or the Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series limit or exclude such security
interest from the collateral securing such series of Senior Liabilities, such series of Senior Liabilities will not
receive any net proceeds resulting from the enforcement of such security interests that was so limited or
excluded. The foregoing does not apply to the extent security has been granted over a particular asset under one
or more Senior Finance Documents which (A) security does not secure a particular series of Senior Liabilities or
(B) the Senior Finance Documents in respect of a particular series of Senior Liabilities limit or exclude such
security from the collateral securing such series of Senior Liabilities, but other security has been granted over
that asset which does secure such series of Senior Liabilities and is not so limited or excluded from the collateral
securing such series of Senior Liabilities.

**_Turnover_**

If any hedge counterparty, any creditor under intra-group debt or any obligor receives or recovers any
payment in contravention of the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed, it is required to hold such payment on

162


-----

trust and pay over such amounts to the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee for application in accordance with
the order of application set forth above under “—General Application of Proceeds”.

**_Purchase Option_**

If an event of default has occurred under the VM Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities
Agreement and the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee or the Senior Lenders have begun any formal step to
enforce any guarantee under any Senior Finance Document and/or security under any Security Document, the
Additional Senior Finance Parties may, at the expense of such Additional Senior Finance Parties, purchase or
procure the purchase of all (but not part) of the rights and obligations of the Senior Lenders in connection with
the Senior Liabilities under the VM Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement upon 10
business days’ prior written notice.

If any Additional Senior Finance Parties in respect of more than one series of Additional Senior Liabilities
attempts to exercise this purchase option by procuring the service of the notice described above, such right will
be shared on a pro rata basis among the series of Additional Senior Liabilities that have served such notice.

Any such purchase shall take effect on the following terms:

    - payment in full in cash of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount under the VM Credit
Facility (or any future Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement) as of the date that amount is to be
paid (including all accrued interest, fees and expenses, but not any prepayment fees, other than LIBOR/
EURIBOR break funding costs, if any);

    - payment in full in cash of the amount which each Senior Lender certifies to be necessary to compensate
it for any loss on account of funds borrowed, contracted for or utilized to fund any amount included in
the Senior Liabilities, resulting from the receipt of that payment otherwise than on the last day of an
interest period under the VM Credit Facility or the Designated Refinancing Facilities Agreement, in
relation thereto;

    - after the transfer, no Senior Lender (in their capacity as such) will be under any actual or contingent
liability to any obligor or any other person under the Group Intercreditor Deed or any Senior Finance
Document for which it is not holding cash collateral in an amount and established on terms reasonably
satisfactory to it;

    - an indemnity is provided from each of the purchasing Additional Senior Finance Parties (or from
another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders) to the Senior Lenders in respect of all losses
which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender in consequence of any sum received or
recovered by any Senior Lender from any Senior Finance Party or obligor, or any other person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior
Lender for any reason whatsoever, provided that where it is demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Senior Lenders that those losses could not have been recovered in full by the relevant Senior
Lender under the Senior Finance Documents, had that transfer not been made, that indemnity shall not
extend to the shortfall; and

    - the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, the Senior Lenders, except that
each Senior Lender shall be deemed to have given certain limited warranties on the date of that
transfer.

**_Amendments_**

Save for certain technical amendments which may be made without reference to the Priority Creditors, the
agent or representative acting for the Instructing Party may, from time to time, agree with VMIH to amend the
Group Intercreditor Deed and any amendments so made will be binding on all the parties hereto, provided that
any amendment which would:

    - materially and adversely affect any rights of the Priority Creditors may not be made without the prior
written consent of the Instructing Party, provided that in the case of any such amendments which would
affect the rights of a series of Senior Liabilities in a way that is material and adverse relative to one or
more other series, the applicable consent of such affected series (as determined pursuant to the Senior
Finance Documents in respect of such series) will also be required;

    - impose or vary any obligation on the Priority Creditors may not be made without the prior written
consent of the Instructing Party, provided that in the case of any such amendment which imposes or

163


-----

varies the obligations of a series of Senior Liabilities in a way that is material and adverse relative to
one or more other series, the applicable consent of such affected series (as determined pursuant to the
Senior Finance Documents in respect of such series) will also be required;

    - have the effect of (i) changing the pari passu ranking of the secured hedging liabilities with the Senior
Liabilities or the pro rata basis of payment to the Second Beneficiaries described under “—General
_Application of Proceeds”, (ii) changing the amendments clause or (iii) the secured hedge counterparties_
ceasing to be Priority Creditors or the secured hedging liabilities ceasing to be secured obligations, in
each case, may not be made without the prior written consent of each secured hedge counterparty
adversely affected thereby; or

    - adversely affect any right, or impose or vary any obligation, of any party hereto other than a Priority
Creditor may not be made without the consent of that party.

Any amendment which relates to, or has the effect of, subordinating all or any portion of any series of
Senior Liabilities to the other Senior Liabilities will only require the consent of the Instructing Party and the
applicable consent of such series being subordinated (as determined pursuant to the Senior Finance Documents in
respect of such series).

**High Yield Intercreditor Deed**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed currently governs the relationship of the various lenders under the VM
Credit Facility, holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes, certain related counterparties, VMIH, VMIL,
the VM Senior Notes Issuer and the VM Secured Notes Issuer. The High Yield Intercreditor Deed contains
express provisions for the subordination of certain guarantees and intercompany loans. We collectively refer to
these obligations as “subordinated obligations”.

**_Priorities_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that the following liabilities rank and should be paid and
discharged in the following order:

FIRST, the Senior Liabilities (as described below), pari passu without any priority among themselves (but
without prejudice to any alternative priorities in the Group Intercreditor Deed);

SECOND, the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities, pari passu with any other senior subordinated obligations
of any High Yield Guarantor and without any priority among themselves; and

THIRD, the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities.

**_Senior Liabilities and High Yield Guarantee Liabilities_**

For the purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed, “Senior Liabilities” include all present and future
obligations and liabilities of the obligors to the Senior Finance Parties under or in connection with the Senior
Finance Documents including any New Senior Liabilities together with any related additional liabilities owed to
the Senior Finance Parties and together also with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by each of the Senior
Finance Parties in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of its rights under the Senior
Finance Documents, which includes secured hedging liabilities. The obligations under the VM Credit Facility
(including the New Finco Facilities), the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and the related secured hedging
liabilities will constitute Senior Liabilities for purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed.

For the purposes of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed, “High Yield Guarantee Liabilities” include all
present and future obligations and liabilities of any High Yield Guarantor to any High Yield Creditors pursuant to
any High Yield Guarantee, together with any related additional liabilities owed to any High Yield Creditor
pursuant to any High Yield Guarantee in connection with the protection, preservation or enforcement of the
rights of such High Yield Creditors under the indenture and other related documentation with respect thereto.

**_Prohibited Action_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed prescribes certain restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on the
ability of any High Yield Guarantor in respect of the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or any Intra-group Debtor
in respect of the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities:

    - to make payments on (see “Payment Blockage” below);

    - to grant security for;

    - to defease; or

    - otherwise to provide financial support in relation to,

165


-----

the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities for so long as the Senior
Liabilities remain outstanding. In the event of a payment default with respect to the Senior Liabilities, service of
a payment blockage notice is not required to effect the restrictions described above.

**_Payment Blockage_**

A payment blockage notice may be served by the Instructing Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility)
or representatives of Designated Indebtedness (if applicable) on, among others, the trustee of any High Yield
Notes during the continuance of a non-payment event of default with respect to the Senior Liabilities. While a
payment blockage is in effect, any High Yield Guarantor and any Intra-group Debtor will be prohibited from
making any payment with respect to the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or the Subordinated Intra-group
Liabilities, as applicable. In the event of a payment default with respect to the Senior Liabilities, service of a
payment blockage notice is not required to effect the restriction on making payments referred to under the
“Prohibited Action” section above.

However, a payment blockage notice is only permitted to be served on or before the date falling 45 days
after the date on which notice of such event of default has been received by the agent or representative of the
relevant series of Senior Liabilities. A payment blockage notice will remain outstanding, unless cancelled, until
the earliest of:

    - 179 days after the date of such payment blockage notice;

    - the date on which the event of default under the Senior Liabilities is no longer continuing or is
remedied or waived;

    - cancellation of such payment blockage notice by the agent or representative of the relevant series of
Senior Liabilities which initially served such notice;

    - if any standstill period is in effect on the date of the service of such payment blockage notice, the date
on which such existing standstill period expired; or

    - the date on which the Senior Liabilities have been discharged in full.

Only one blockage notice is permitted to be served in respect of a particular event or circumstance, and only
one blockage notice is permitted to be served in any consecutive 360-day period relating to an event of default
under the Senior Liabilities which was existing at the time of such payment blockage notice, unless such event of
default has been remedied and is no longer continuing for at least 180 days prior to the service of the proposed
new payment blockage notice.

**_Standstill on Enforcement_**

The trustee under the indentures governing any of our High Yield Notes and the holders of such High Yield
Notes may bring an action to enforce the obligations of the VM Senior Notes Issuer thereunder and, subject to
the circumstances described below, the obligations of the relevant High Yield Guarantor under the related High
Yield Guarantee. Subject also to the circumstances described below, the VM Senior Notes Issuer may also take
action to enforce the obligations in respect of the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities. Enforcement in respect of
any High Yield Notes against the VM Senior Notes Issuer is not restricted by the High Yield Intercreditor Deed.
However, enforcement action may not be taken with respect to the Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities, and the
High Yield Guarantees will not become due, unless:

    - all of the Senior Liabilities have been discharged in full;

    - an insolvency event has occurred in relation to the relevant obligor;

    - any Senior Liabilities have been declared due and payable or due and payable on demand, or the
lenders thereunder have taken any action to enforce any security interest or lien granted in connection
with such obligations; or

    - a default has occurred with respect to the relevant High Yield Guarantees, the agents or representatives
of the Senior Liabilities have been notified of such default, a standstill period of 179 days has expired
and at the end of such period the default is continuing, unremedied or unwaived.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

In the event of an insolvency of any Intra-group Debtor, any High Yield Guarantor or any member of the
group which is a party to a secured hedging agreement, the High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that all High
Yield Guarantee Liabilities and Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities will be subordinated to the prior payment in

enforce, the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities and Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities and any amounts so
received in respect thereof shall be applied by the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee towards all Senior
Liabilities obligations outstanding until such obligations have been paid in full.

**_Turnover and Application of Proceeds_**

In the event that, in contravention of the subordination terms described above, or at a time when payments
are not permitted to be made:

    - the VM Senior Notes Issuer receives or recovers a payment or distribution, in cash or in-kind, relating
to any Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities, or

    - the VM Senior Notes Issuer, the trustee under the indentures governing any High Yield Notes or any
holder thereof receives or recovers a payment under any High Yield Guarantee,

such person will turn over such amount to the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee for application towards
payment of the Senior Liabilities until the obligations under the Senior Liabilities are paid in full as described
below under “—Priority of Payments”.

**_Release of the High Yield Guarantees_**

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides for the automatic and unconditional release and discharge of
High Yield Guarantees concurrently with any sales of all of the shares of any High Yield Guarantor or any of its
direct or indirect holding companies or of all or substantially all of the assets of a High Yield Guarantor by the
VM Credit Facility Security Trustee or an administrator appointed under the U.K. Insolvency Act of 1986. In
order for the release to be effective:

    - the proceeds of such sale must be in cash, or substantially in cash, and must be applied as described
below under “—Priority of Payments;”

    - the relevant High Yield Guarantor must be released from its obligations in respect of any other
indebtedness of any member of the restricted group, except for the Senior Liabilities and claims by the
trustee pursuant to the terms of any indenture governing the relevant High Yield Notes; and

    - the sale must be made pursuant to either a public auction or a competitive bid process to obtain the best
price reasonably obtainable given the then current condition (financial or otherwise), earnings,
business, assets and prospects of the relevant High Yield Guarantor and its subsidiaries, the VM Credit
Facility Security Trustee or administrator having consulted with an internationally recognized
investment bank, including without limitation and to the extent appropriate a Senior Lender (as defined
in the High Yield Intercreditor Deed) or a relationship bank of the VM Senior Notes Issuer or its
subsidiaries, or an internationally recognized accounting firm regarding the appropriate procedures for
obtaining the best price for the shares or assets, considered the recommendations of that investment
bank or accounting firm and used its reasonable efforts to cause the procedures recommended by that
investment bank or accounting firm to be implemented in all material respects in relation to the sale
and to permit holders of the relevant High Yield Notes to participate in the sale process as bidders.

The High Yield Intercreditor Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the VM Credit
Facility Security Trustee, the procedures referred to above are not implemented by the relevant court or other
authority or any other third party required to act in connection with such sale, the VM Credit Facility Security
Trustee will not be under any further obligation to cause such procedures to be implemented by such authority.

**_Priority of Payments_**

The postponement, subordination, blockage and prevention of payment of the High Yield Guarantees is not
intended to and will not impair the obligation of the High Yield Guarantors to pay the holders of the High Yield
Notes all amounts due and payable under such guarantees as and when they become due and payable in
accordance with the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed. The liabilities owed to the creditors of any High
Yield Guarantor will be paid and discharged in the following order:

FIRST, towards any liabilities owed to the trustee under the indentures of the High Yield Notes in respect of
any costs, charges or expenses incurred by or payable to it in its capacity as trustee under such indentures pari
_passu with the VM Credit Facility Security Trustee in respect of any costs, charges or expenses incurred by or_
payable to it in its capacity as VM Credit Facility Security Trustee;

SECOND, towards any fees, costs, commissions or expenses payable to any Senior Finance Parties in
relation to Senior Liabilities;

FOURTH, towards any liabilities owed to the holders of any of the High Yield Notes in respect of the
related High Yield Guarantee; and

FIFTH, towards payment of any Subordinated Intra-group Liabilities owed to the VM Senior Notes Issuer
by any Intra-group Debtor.

Any additional amounts remaining after discharge of the above listed liabilities will be paid to the relevant
obligor or any other person or persons entitled thereto.

errors or resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case of a minor technical or administrative nature or as
otherwise prescribed by the relevant Debt Documents.

Each Agent will, to the extent consented to by the requisite percentage of Creditors it represents or it is
otherwise authorised by the Debt Documents to which it is a party, act on such instructions in accordance
therewith unless to the extent any amendments so consented to or authorised relate to any provision affecting the
rights and obligations of that Agent in its capacity as such.

Where the Security Agent’s consent is required for any amendment or waiver it will act on the instructions
of the applicable Instructing Group, provided that in all cases such consent of the Security Agent shall be deemed

_Exceptions_

Subject to the penultimate and last paragraphs under this caption “Exceptions”, if the amendment, waiver or
Consent may impose new or additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party (other than
in the case of a Primary Creditor, in a way which affects, or would affect, Primary Creditors of that party’s class
generally or in the case of a Debtor, to the extent Consented to by the Company under the New Group
Intercreditor Agreement), then the Consent of that party is required.

Subject to the paragraph immediately below, an amendment, waiver or Consent which relates to the rights
or obligations of an Agent, an Arranger, the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of the Security Agent to act in its discretion under the New Group Intercreditor Agreement) may not
be effected without the Consent of that Agent or, as the case may be, that Arranger or the Security Agent.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply to any release of security, claim or
liabilities or to any Consent which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set

Agent and the Company specify) or (ii) provide details of its Senior Secured Credit Participation, Second Lien
Credit Participation, High Yield Credit Participation or Unsecured Credit Participation to the Security Agent
within the timescale specified by the Security Agent, then:

(A) in the case of paragraph (a) above, that Senior Secured Credit Participation, Second Lien Credit
Participation, High Yield Credit Participation or Unsecured Credit Participation shall be deemed to be
zero and its status as a Second Lien Creditor, Senior Secured Creditor, High Yield Creditor or
Unsecured Creditor shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the relevant participations when
ascertaining whether any relevant percentage has been obtained for such Consent, approval or vote; and

(B) in the case of paragraph (b) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been
given.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the New Group Intercreditor Agreement or the Supplemental Deed, the
New Group Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary. However, such
override, as between any Creditor, any Debtor or any member of the Group or Security Grantor, will not cure,
postpone, waive or negate any breach, default or event of default under any Debt Document as provided in the
relevant Debt Document.

law.

Pari Passu Debt Liabilities will rank in right and priority of payment pari passu among themselves and the
Shared Security Documents secure the Note Liabilities and the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities owed to the Senior
Secured Creditors pari passu among themselves.

**_Enforcement_**

At any time after an Accelerated Default has occurred and whilst it is continuing, the Security Trustee shall
takes such steps as it is instructed to do so to perfect, protect or enforce the Security and/or dispose of an asset
which is the subject of the Security or the shares in or Liabilities or obligations of the Debtor and/or collect and

Passu Debt Liabilities.

Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement, no Senior Secured Creditor has any independent
power to enforce, or has recourse to, any Security except through the Security Trustee, and the Security Trustee
shall enforce the Security if so instructed to do so by the Instructing Group (who may give or refrain from giving
instructions to the Security Trustee to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Security as it sees fit). The Security
Trustee is not obliged to enforce the Security if it has not received security and/or pre-funding and/or been
indemnified to its satisfaction and each of the Senior Secured Creditors waives all rights to require that the
Security is enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time or that any sum received or
recovered from any person which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Liabilities is
so applied.

**_Releases and Disposals of Security_**

If, in connection with the enforcement of Security, the Security Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of any

receiver, delegate attorney or agent under or in connection with the Collateral Sharing Agreement or
the Shared Security Documents (including without limitation, in connection with the perfection,
preservation or actual or attempted enforcement of the Security and any indemnity or remuneration,
fees and other expenses or costs);

discretion hold any amount of the Recoveries in a suspense or impersonal account(s) in the name of the Security
Trustee for so long as the Security Trustee shall think fit until otherwise directed by Instructing Group (the
interest being credited to the relevant account) for later application from time to time of those monies in the
Security Trustee’s discretion.

**_Turnover of Proceeds_**

The Collateral Sharing Agreement provides that, subject to certain provisions, if any Senior Secured
Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of Security, otherwise than in accordance with the
“Application of Proceeds” section described above, subject to certain exceptions, such Senior Secured Creditor
must promptly notify the Security Trustee and hold an amount (which shall not be in excess of the amount that
the Security Trustee reasonably considers might become owing at any time in the future) of that receipt or
recovery on trust for the Security Trustee and promptly pay that amount to the Security Trustee for application in
accordance with the “Application of Proceeds” section described above. The Debtor is under a similar obligation
to turn over any amounts received or recovered under any Finco Loan Agreement, following the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Liabilities or any enforcement of the Security, or at any time under the Group Intercreditor
Deed to the Security Trustee.

**_Amendments and Waivers—Collateral Sharing Agreement_**

Other than technical amendments or waivers made to or in relation to the Collateral Sharing Agreement:
(i) to correct any manifest error or typographical error; (ii) to resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or to effect
changes of a minor, technical, operational or administrative nature, or, (iii) for the purposes of addressing
technical issues arising under local law and in connection with the Security, which in each case may be agreed in
writing between the Security Trustee and the Debtor, the Collateral Sharing Agreement may, subject to certain
exceptions, only be amended or waived with the written agreement of the Note Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative acting in accordance with the required consent of each of the applicable Senior Secured Creditors
under the applicable Debt Documents.

To the extent an amendment, waiver or consent affects only one tranche of Debt and such amendment,
waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the Senior
Secured Creditors of the other tranches of debt, only written agreement from the representative of that tranche of
Senior Secured Liabilities is required in each case, acting in accordance with the required consent of the
applicable Senior Secured Creditors under the applicable Debt Documents.

**_Amendments and Waivers—Shared Security Documents_**

Any provision of a Shared Security Document may be amended or waived by the written agreement of the
Debtor and the Security Trustee (acting in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Sharing Agreement
and the relevant Shared Security Documents).

**_Additional Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Debtor may borrow additional loans and/or issue new note debt at any time without the prior consent of
any other Senior Secured Creditor, provided that, in each case, the incurrence of such Note Liabilities and Pari
Passu Debt Liabilities is permitted or not prohibited under the Debt Documents existing at the time of such issue,
and (subject to certain accession requirements), once incurred, any such new Note Liabilities and new Pari Passu
Debt Liabilities shall be treated as Senior Secured Liabilities for the purposes of the Collateral Sharing
Agreement.

186


-----

**_Group Intercreditor Deed_**

Where the Finco Lender receives a Group Intercreditor Agreement Voting Request or otherwise becomes
entitled to exercise a Group Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such
right in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group provided that (other than in the case of a Group
Intercreditor Agreement Voting Request or a Group Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right relating to directions
or instructions to the security trustee under the Group Intercreditor Agreement in relation to any enforcement
action under the Group Debt Documents (including the enforcement of any Security (as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Deed))) to the extent a corresponding consent, amendment, release, waiver, direction, instruction or
other vote is not required to be submitted to the relevant Senior Secured Creditors pursuant to the terms of any
Debt Documents applicable to a specific tranche of Senior Secured Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities of
such tranche shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of calculating the Instructing Group.

**_HYD Intercreditor Deed_**

Where the Finco Lender receives a HYD Intercreditor Agreement Voting Request or otherwise becomes
entitled to exercise a HYD Intercreditor Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such
right in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group provided that to the extent a corresponding
consent, amendment, release, waiver, direction, instruction or other vote is not required to be submitted to the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors pursuant to the terms of any Debt Documents applicable to a specific tranche
of Senior Secured Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities of such tranche shall be deemed to be zero for the
purposes of calculating the Instructing Group.

**_Senior Facilities Agreement_**

Where the Finco Lender receives a Senior Facilities Agreement Voting Request or otherwise becomes
entitled to exercise a Senior Facilities Agreement Lender Right, it will cast its vote or otherwise exercise such
right in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, any relevant Finco Loan Agreement and
any relevant Debt Documents.

**_Equalization_**

If, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which certain
specified enforcement action is taken and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the
proportions which their respective exposures at that date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior
Secured Creditors at such date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject to certain terms) will make such payments
among themselves as the Security Trustee shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that
(after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

(b) VM Facility L, VM Facility M, VM Facility N, VM Facility O, VM Facility Q and VM Facility R are each
subject to a LIBOR or EURIBOR floor of 0.00%, as applicable.

(c) As of March 31, 2021, VM Facility P, VM Facility Q, VM Facility R, VM Facility S, VM Facility T and
VM Facility U were each undrawn and were only available to be drawn and utilized upon consummation of
the Joint Venture. Accordingly, unused borrowing capacity at March 31, 2021 excludes the availability
under these facilities, as applicable.

(d) Unused borrowing capacity under the VM Credit Facilities relates to multi-currency revolving facilities (the
“VM Revolving Credit Facility”) with an aggregate maximum borrowing capacity equivalent to
£1,000.0 million and has a fee on unused commitments equal to 40% of the Revolving Facility Margin
which, in relation to any revolving facility advance is 2.75% per annum.

**_Interest Rates_**

Under the VM Credit Facility, the rate of interest for each interest period in respect of each Facility under
the VM Credit Facility is the percentage rate per annum equal to the aggregate of an applicable margin and
LIBOR (or if loans are denominated in euro, EURIBOR). Interest on each of the facilities accrues daily from and
including the first day of an interest period and is payable on the last day of each interest period (unless the
interest period is longer than six months, in which case interest is payable on the last day of each six-month
period) and is calculated on the basis of a 365-day year (in the case of amounts denominated in sterling) or
360-day year (in the case of amounts denominated in any other currency and with respect to VM Facility S).

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The VM Credit Facility requires (the “VM Credit Facility 80% Security Test”) that members of the Bank
Group which generate not less than 80% of the EBITDA of the Bank Group (excluding any EBITDA attributable
to any joint venture) in any financial year guarantee the payment of all sums payable under the VM Credit
Facility and related finance documentation and such members are required to grant first-ranking security over all
or substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable under the VM Credit Facility and
related finance documentation; provided, that the EBITDA of any member of the Bank Group that is not required
to (or cannot) become a Guarantor and grant security (or procure the granting of Security) due to the agreed
security principles shall be disregarded for this calculation; provided, further, that on and after the Asset Security
Release Date, the security shall be limited to (i) share pledges of all of the capital stock of the Borrowers and the

190


-----

Obligors thereunder and (ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors in relation to certain intercompany loans
(the security securing the VM Credit Facility from time to time, the “VM Credit Facility Collateral”).

**_Prepayment_**

The VM Credit Facility contains detailed provisions in relation to voluntary and mandatory prepayment.
Such prepayments are subject to certain conditions and exceptions, and the VM Credit Facility also contains
detailed provisions regarding the order in which such prepayment proceeds are applied.

In addition to scheduled repayments of principal and interest, the VM Credit Facility must be prepaid (each
tranche in such proportion as described in the VM Credit Facility) on the occurrence of any of the following
events: (i) a Change of Control as defined therein followed by a request for repayment from the Facility Agent
acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group by not less than 30 Business Days’ notice; (ii) if it becomes
illegal for a Lender to perform any of its obligations relating to the VM Credit Facility (in which case, that
Lender must be prepaid); or (iii) certain Permitted Disposals as defined therein (and subject to certain conditions)
with the net proceeds thereof. Any mandatory prepayment is to be applied firstly against the term loans, secondly
against the revolving credit facilities (in the order of revolving loans followed by documentary credit
outstandings) and thirdly against repayment of any ancillary facility outstandings.

Further, the indebtedness under the VM Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid on giving at least three
Business Days’ prior written notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed between VMIH and the Facility
Agent). A term loan can be voluntarily prepaid in a minimum amount as is agreed by the VMIH and the relevant
Lender. A revolving facility loan can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part but, if in part, in a minimum
amount of £1,000,000 and an integral multiple of £500,000 together with accrued interest on the amount repaid
without premium or penalty but subject to break funding costs.

**_Undertakings_**

The VM Credit Facility contains certain undertakings that, subject to certain customary and other agreed
exceptions, limit the ability of each Obligor and, in certain cases, each member of the Bank Group, to, among
other things:

    - incur, create or otherwise permit to be outstanding any Financial Indebtedness;

    - reduce its capital or purchase or redeem any class of its shares or any other ownership interest in it;

    - create or permit to subsist any Security Interest on or over the whole or any part of its present or future
assets, rights or revenues to secure or prefer any present or future Financial Indebtedness of any
member of the Bank Group or any other person;

    - dispose of all or any part of its assets;

    - make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another company or person;

    - grant or make any loans, any credit or any guarantees or enter into any transaction having the effect of
lending money to any person;

    - amend its constitutional documents in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Obligors (taken as a whole) to perform their payment obligations
under any of the Relevant Finance Documents;

    - declare, make or pay any dividend on or make any distribution on account of any class of its share
capital or capital stock or other securities to a Restricted Person;

    - make any payment of principal or interest on any loans to a Restricted Person; or

    - liquidate on a solvent basis.

In addition, the VM Credit Facility also requires each Obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings
subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions.

intended to be refinanced with long-term Financial Indebtedness);
and

(iv) any amount of Financial Indebtedness that does not exceed the
greater of £330,000,000 (or its equivalent) and 3.00% of Total Assets
at any time outstanding,

provided, that (w) any Additional Facility may be incurred under any of
the above paragraphs as selected by VMIH in its sole discretion,
(x) VMIH may elect to incur Additional Facilities under paragraph
(i) prior to using amounts available under paragraphs (iii) and (iv),
(y) amounts incurred pursuant to paragraph (iv) substantially concurrently
with amounts incurred to paragraph (i) will not count as Financial
Indebtedness for the purposes of calculating Senior Net Debt and
(z) VMIH shall have the ability to classify such amounts of Financial
Indebtedness on the date of their incurrence and shall only be required to
include the amount and type of such Financial Indebtedness in one of such
sub-paragraphs above and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence
to divide and classify an item of such Financial Indebtedness in more than
one of the types of Financial Indebtedness described in such-paragraphs,
and, from time to time, may reclassify all or a portion of such Financial
Indebtedness, in any manner, (the “Additional Facilities Cap”).

There shall be no limit on the aggregate principal amount of any proposed
Additional Facility (a “Refinancing Additional Facility”) established in
exchange for, or to extend, renew, replace, repurchase, retire or refinance,
in whole, or in part, existing Utilisations or Commitments (the
“Refinanced Debt”), provided that if the obligations under such
Refinancing Additional Facility do not rank equal to or `junior to such
existing Utilisations and Commitments the principal amount of such
Refinancing Additional Facility shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Additional Facilities Cap (or its equivalent in other currencies).

A Refinancing Additional Facility may only be established if the
following conditions are met:

(i) it provides for Additional Facility Commitments which are in an
aggregate principal amount that is not less than £1,000,000 or
$1,000,000 in the case of any revolving loan facility and £15,000,000
or $15,000,000 in the case of any Term Facility, provided that such
amount may be less if equal to (x) in the case of Refinanced Debt
that is in the form of a Utilisation, the entire outstanding principal
amount of that Refinanced Debt or (y) in the case of Refinanced
Debt that is in the form of a Commitment, the entire commitment
amount of that Refinanced Debt;

(ii) in the case of Refinancing Additional Facilities which are Term
Facilities (a) it does not have a greater principal amount than the
principal amount of the Refinanced Debt plus accrued interest, fees,

premiums (if any) and penalties thereon and fees, expenses, OID and
upfront fees associated with the refinancing of such Refinanced Debt,
(b) it ranks pari passu or junior in right of payment with any Additional
Facility Commitments which are senior in right of payment and shall
rank pari passu or junior in right of Security with the Additional Facility
Commitments which are secured on a first ranking basis in accordance
with the terms of an intercreditor agreement or arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Facility Agent, and (c) to the extent
applicable, it is subject to the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the
HYD Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) in the case of Refinancing Additional Facilities which are revolving
facilities (a) it ranks pari passu or junior in right of payment with the

Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement.

9. **Purpose** See “—Accession Agreements to the VM Credit Facility” above.

10. Final Maturity Date See “—Accession Agreements to the VM Credit Facility” above.

11. Interest Under the VM Credit Facility, the rate of interest for each Advance (for
an interest period (i) for the VM Revolving Credit Facility between 1 day
to 30 days or 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or such other period of up to 12 months
as the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group
in relation to that revolving facility) may agree with VMIH (ii) for a term
facility 1, 2, 3 or 6 months or such longer period of up to 12 months as all
the Lenders holding Commitments under that Facility may agree,
provided further that the first interest period may be any other period of
6 months or less as agreed by the Borrower and the Facility Agent) is
expressed to be the rate per annum determined by the Facility Agent to be
the aggregate of:

(a) the applicable margin; and

(b) EURIBOR in the case of an Advance denominated in euros or
LIBOR in the case of an Advance denominated in any other
currency;

The interest rate for each of the VM Credit Facilities is as set forth under
“—Accession Agreements to the VM Credit Facility” above.
Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period. Default interest
for unpaid amounts shall be 1% above the standard margin level.

12. EURIBOR/LIBOR In relation to VM Facility L, VM Facility M, VM Facility N, VM Facility
O, VM Facility Q and VM Facility R the respective EURIBOR/LIBOR
floor shall be zero.

13. Repayment Each of the VM Credit Facilities is repayable in full on its respective
maturity date set forth under “—Accession Agreements to the VM Credit
_Facility” above._

14. Mandatory Prepayment Mandatory prepayment and cancellation of an Advance is required in the
circumstances set out in greater detail in the VM Credit Facility, including
in the circumstances described below.

(a) If at any time it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a
Lender to perform any of its obligations then that Lender shall
promptly notify the Facility Agent. Upon the Facility Agent
notifying VMIH of the same: (i) the Commitments of that Lender

194


-----

shall immediately be reduced to zero and cancelled or, if required by
VMIH, transferred to another bank or institution willing to accept
that transfer; and (ii) on such date as the Facility Agent shall specify
(being no earlier than the last day permitted by law), VMIH will
procure that each Borrower repays that Lender’s participations in the
relevant Utilisations or, if required by VMIH, that Lender’s
participations are transferred to another bank or institution willing to
accept that transfer.

(b) If required by the Instructing Group, the Facility Agent shall cancel
each Facility and declare all outstanding Advances immediately due
and payable if (i) the Controlling Company ceases to be the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total
voting power of VMIH or, after a Permitted Affiliate Group
Designation Date, a Permitted Affiliate Parent and ceases to by
virtue of the articles of association or other documents, directly or
indirectly, direct or cause the direction of management and policies
of VMIH or, after a Permitted Affiliate Group Designation Date, a
Permitted Affiliate Parent; (ii) the disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of VMIH, a Permitted Affiliate Parent (after any
Permitted Affiliate Group Designation Date) and the Restricted
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) other than as a result of the transfer
of receivables to any Asset Securitisation Subsidiary in connection
with any asset securitisation program; or (iii) at any time after a
Permitted Affiliate Group Designation Date, any Permitted Affiliate
Holdco ceases to be the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
100% of the total voting power of the voting stock of any Permitted
Affiliate Parent.

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the event listed at (b)(i)
above upon the consummation of the Post-Closing Reorganisation or a
Spin-Off.

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the event listed (b)(i) and
(b)(iii) above upon the liquidation on a solvent basis of a Permitted
Affiliate Holdco provided that:

(1) 100 per cent. of the shares in the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent
continue to be secured in favor of the Finance Parties on a first
ranking basis without any material adverse effect on the interests of
the Finance Parties;

(2) the successor Permitted Affiliate Holdco is not organised in a
jurisdiction which would result in a materially adverse effect on the
ability of the Finance Parties to enforce the Security over the shares
in the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent; and

(3) the successor Permitted Affiliate Holdco is the sole shareholder of
the relevant Permitted Affiliate Parent.

No Change of Control shall arise as a result of the events listed at (b)(i)
and (b)(iii) upon the sale of 100 per cent. of the shares in a Permitted
Affiliate Parent by a Permitted Affiliate Holdco provided that such sale
falls within one or more of the paragraphs of the definition of Permitted
Disposal.

(c) Upon the receipt of proceeds from certain Permitted Disposals,
VMIH shall procure that an amount of the Facilities is prepaid which
is the lesser of (i) the amount of the Net Proceeds of such a disposal
and (ii) an amount so as to ensure that Financial Ratio (as defined
below) for the most recent Ratio Period ending prior to the receipt of
such proceeds would not be breached if the Financial Ratio was
tested for that most recent Ratio Period taking into account (on a pro
_forma basis) the amount of such prepayment (but ignoring such Net_
Proceeds).

195


-----

No prepayment is required where:

(1) the amount of such prepayment would be less than the greater of
£200,000,000 and 2% of Total Assets;

(2) in connection with any Permitted Disposal where an amount equal to
the amount of such prepayment is reinvested in assets (including,
permitted acquisitions, permitted capital expenditure, operational
expenditure and permitted joint ventures) provided further that any
amount that has not been contracted to be so reinvested within
12 months and reinvested within 18 months (the “Reinvestment End
**Date”) shall be applied in prepayment, provided further that there**
shall be no requirement to make a prepayment if the Financial Ratio
was not required to be tested for the most recent Ratio Period ending
prior to the Reinvestment End Date.

Any prepayment of Utilisations from disposal proceeds shall be applied
first against the term loan facilities in such order as at the discretion of the
relevant Borrower, second against any revolving facilities on a pro rata
basis (in the order of revolving loan facilities followed by documentary
credits) and thirdly against any ancillary facilities.

15. Voluntary Prepayment Voluntary prepayment of any term loan or revolving facility loan by a
Borrower is permitted at any time on not less than three Business Days’
prior written notice, or such shorter period as may be agreed between
VMIH and the Facility Agent (such notice to be irrevocable).

A term loan can be voluntarily prepaid in a minimum amount as is agreed
by the VMIH and the relevant Lender.

A revolving facility loan can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part
but, if in part, in a minimum amount of £1,000,000 and an integral
multiple of £500,000 together with accrued interest on the amount repaid
without premium or penalty but subject to the payment of any Break
Costs (if applicable).

16. Cancellation Any unutilized amount of the Total Commitments may be cancelled by
VMIH, in whole or in part, at any time on not less than three Business
Days’ prior notice, or such shorter period as may be agreed between
VMIH and the Facility Agent (such notice to be irrevocable).

Partial cancellation must be in a minimum amount of £5,000,000 and an
integral multiple of £1,000,000. No premium or penalty shall apply in
respect of any repayment save for break costs and amounts cancelled may
not be reinstated.

The undrawn amount of any Commitment under any Facility shall be
automatically cancelled at the close of business on the last day of the
availability period of that Facility.

If any sum payable to any Lender or Ancillary Facility Lender or L/C
Bank by an Obligor is required to be increased under the tax gross-up
provisions in the VM Credit Facility, any Lender or Ancillary Facility
Lender or L/C Bank claims indemnification from VMIH or a Borrower
under the tax indemnity provisions in the VM Credit Facility or any
Lender or Ancillary Facility Lender or L/C Bank invokes the market
disruption provisions of the VM Credit Facility or seeks mandatory
prepayment as a result of any illegality, where such circumstances relate
to a Lender, VMIH may arrange for the transfer and assignment of the
whole (at par only) of that Lender’s Commitment and participation in the
Utilisations to a new or existing Lender willing to accept that transfer or
assignment.

17. Security The VM Credit Facility requires that members of the Bank Group which
generate not less than 80% of the EBITDA of the Bank Group (excluding
the consolidated net income attributable to any joint venture) in any

196


-----

financial year grant first-ranking security over all or substantially all of
their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable under the VM
Credit Facility and related finance documentation; provided that the
EBITDA of any member of the Bank Group that is not required to (or
cannot) become a Guarantor and grant security due to the agreed security
principles shall be disregarded for this calculation.

On and after the Asset Security Release Date, the security shall be limited
to (i) share pledges of all of the capital stock of the Borrowers and the
Obligors thereunder and (ii) a pledge of rights of the relevant creditors in
relation to certain intercompany loans.

18. Representations and The VM Credit Facility contains customary representations and
**Warranties** warranties for this type of agreement (subject to agreed exceptions,
materiality and material adverse effect qualifications and disclosures as

20. Financial Covenant The VM Credit Facility requires that in the event that on the last day of a
Ratio Period, the aggregate of the Revolving Facility Outstandings and any
Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to any Additional Facility that is a
revolving facility (other than cash collateralised or undrawn documentary
credits) and the net indebtedness outstanding under each Ancillary Facility,
less Cash of the Bank Group, exceeds an amount equal to 40% of the
aggregate Revolving Facility Commitments and any Additional Facility
Commitments and each Ancillary Facility Commitment (the “Financial
**Ratio Test Condition”), VMIH shall procure that the ratio of Total Net Debt**
to Annualised EBITDA on that day (the “Financial Ratio”) shall not exceed
5.50:1 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Composite Revolving
Facility Instructing Group and VMIH.

In circumstances where the Financial Ratio above has been breached for a
Ratio Period but is complied with on the last day of the next Ratio Period
(either because the Financial Ratio Test Condition is not met for that next
Ratio Period or because the Financial Ratio does not exceed 5.50:1 for that
next Ratio Period) then the prior breach of the financial covenant or any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall not (or shall be deemed to not)
directly or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking or other term in the Relevant Finance Documents or a
Default or an Event of Default unless the Facility Agent has taken any action
under the maintenance covenant acceleration provisions prior to the delivery
of compliance certificate in respect of that next Ratio Period.

VMIH may, subject to certain limitations set forth in the VM Credit Facility,
cure a breach of the Financial Ratio by procuring that (i) additional equity is
injected into the Bank Group, (ii) additional Subordinated Funding is
provided to one or more members of the Bank Group and/or (iii) the
Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or Additional Facility Outstandings in
relation to any Additional Facility that is a revolving facility are prepaid such
that if the prepayment had occurred immediately prior to the calculation on

199


-----

the last day of the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose, the
Financial Ratio Test Condition would not have been met and the Financial
Ratio would not have been required to be tested.

VMIH has to comply with a separate financial covenant in relation to VM
Facility P for the sole benefit of the Lenders under that facility. There is a
separate equity cure regime available in relation to this financial covenant and
an independent right for the Lenders under that facility to accelerate if the
financial covenant is breached.

21. Events of Default The VM Credit Facility contains customary events of default for this type
of agreement, including without limitation (and subject to agreed
exceptions, thresholds, materiality and material adverse effect
qualifications and grace periods):

(a) non-payment under the Relevant Finance Documents;

(b) breach of covenants or breach of other provisions of the Relevant
Finance Documents;

(c) a representation or warranty is incorrect in any material respect;

(d) cross-default and cross-acceleration;

(e) insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, moratorium, administration,
enforcement proceedings, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
similar, of any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

(f) any formal voluntary steps towards insolvency proceedings, any
meetings or filing in connection with such proceedings, any petition
for winding-up or similar, or the appointment, or request of
appointment, of liquidator, administrator, receiver or similar in
respect of any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

(g) enforcement of a distress, execution, attachment or other legal
process against any Obligor or Material Subsidiary;

(h) unlawfulness of performance of obligations under the Relevant
Finance Documents or the repudiation of any Relevant Finance
Document;

(i) cessation by the Bank Group (taken as a whole) of all or substantially
all of its business;

(j) breach of the terms of the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the
HYD Intercreditor Agreement by any member of the Wider Group;

(k) loss, breach or failure to renew material licenses;

(l) any event or series of events reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and

(m) the Composite Revolving Facility Instructing Group directs the
Facility Agent to take any acceleration action as a result of a breach of
the undertaking in relation to the Financial Ratio, as described above.

22. Tax All payments under the VM Credit Facility must be made free and clear
of any taxes, deductions or withholdings unless required by law. The
applicable Borrower shall gross-up if necessary with respect to a Lender
that is a Qualifying Lender and Lenders shall reimburse any tax credit
received as a result. If any gross up is necessary, the applicable Borrower
may, while the requirement continues, give notice requesting prepayment
and cancellation in respect of the relevant Lender.

23. Amendments and Waivers Any term of the Finance Documents can be amended or waived only with
the written consent of the Instructing Group and the Obligors affected.

200


-----

However certain waivers and amendments require the consent of each
affected Lender including, without limitation:

(a) an increase in the principal amount of any Commitment;

(b) a reduction in Margin, interest payments, fees or other amounts due;

(c) an extension of maturity and any deferral of any payment; and

(d) any change in the currency of account.

Any amendment or waiver which relates only to the rights or obligations
applicable to a particular Utilisation or Facility and does not materially
and adversely affect the rights or interests of other Lenders may be made
in accordance with the amendment provisions but as if references in such
provisions to the specified proportion of Lenders whose consent would,
but for this class exception, be required for that amendment or waiver
were to that proportion of the Lenders participating in that particular
Utilisation or Facility.

Each Lender that does not respond to a request for waiver or amendment
within 10 Business Days after receipt by it of such request from the
Facility Agent (or within such other period as the Facility Agent and
VMIH may specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in
determining whether the requisite level of consent to such waiver or
amendment was granted.

Upon the completion of any disposal of any shares or assets which is a
permitted disposal or permitted internal reorganisation then the Security
Trustee will execute all documents as required to release those assets from
the Security. VMIH can also request the Security Trustee to execute such
documents as may be required to release any Obligor which is no longer
required to satisfy the VM Credit Facility 80% Security Test.

VMIH can request that Lenders take a transfer of the rights and
obligations of a Non-Consenting Lender. Any Non-Consenting Lender is
required to transfer its rights and obligations to Lenders who agree to
accept such a transfer.

24. Transferability None of the rights, benefits and obligations of the VM Senior Notes Issuer
or an Obligor under the VM Credit Facility can be assigned or transferred
(without the consent of all Lenders) provided that a Borrower may assign
or transfer any of its rights, benefits and obligations to another Borrower
incorporated in the same jurisdiction and which is a directly or indirectly
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the VM Senior Notes Issuer or any Permitted
Affiliate Parent (as applicable) if the VM Senior Notes Issuer delivers to
the Facility Agent (i) a solvency opinion from an independent financial
advisor confirming the solvency of the Bank Group and (ii) legal opinions
confirming that the Security (after giving effect to the assignment or
transfer) are valid and perfected and not otherwise subject to any
limitation or new hardening period, in each case in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Facility Agent.

Lenders can transfer, assign or sub-participate their rights, benefits and
obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents at any time subject to
the following:

(a) a partial transfer must be in a minimum amount of £1,000,000,
$1,000,000 or €1,000,000 (as applicable) unless the aggregate of the
commitments under any Facility is less than such amount, in which
case it is permitted to transfer or assign its entire commitment for
such Facility;

(b) the prior consent of VMIH (not to be unreasonably withheld and
shall be deemed to have been given if not declined in writing within
five Business Days of a written request by any Lender) is required

201


-----

unless transfer is to another Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or certain
Events of Default have occurred including non-payment, insolvency,
insolvency proceedings or creditor’s process; and

(c) a transfer or assignment is effected by a duly complete and executed
Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement and the new lender and
particulars concerning the transferred interests are entered into the
Register.

An existing Lender is not responsible to a new Lender and a new Lender
confirms it has carried out its own appraisal of the Obligors.

No Lender shall be entitled to assign, transfer or sub-participate any of its
rights, benefits or obligations in relation to the Revolving Facility without
the prior written consent of VMIH, provided that no such consent shall be
required in the case of any assignment, transfer or Sub-participation (i) to
another Lender under the Revolving Facility and/or to an Affiliate, in each
case, which is an authorised deposit taking financial institution and
subject to a minimum credit rating and (ii) to any New Lender after the
occurrence of certain non-payment and insolvency Events of Default
which are continuing.

There is no restriction on sub-participations provided that the Lender
remains a Lender under the VM Credit Facility with all rights and
obligations and remains liable for such and retains exclusive control over
all rights and obligations in relation to the participations and
Commitments, including all voting rights.

25. Governing Law The VM Credit Facility is governed by the laws of England and Wales.

26. Miscellaneous The VM Credit Facility is subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
English courts and contains service of process, waiver of immunity and
waiver of trial by jury clauses.

**_VM Revolving Credit Facility Transactions_**

Concurrently with the offering of the Notes, certain of the VM Credit Facility Obligors expect to enter into a
commitment letter with certain financial institutions, including certain lenders under the VM Credit Facility,
pursuant to which the aggregate principal amount of commitments available for borrowing under the VM
Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) shall be increased to an amount up to £1,500 million (the “VM
**Revolving Credit Facility Transactions”). There can be no assurance that the VM Revolving Credit Facility**
Transactions will be consummated on the terms described above or at all.

**_Proposed Amendments to the VM Credit Facility_**

The proposed amendments, waivers, consents and other modifications to the VM Credit Facility set forth in
Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Annexes D, E and F to this offering memorandum (the “VM Credit Facility
**Amendments”) can be implemented once the requisite level of consents from Lenders (i.e. from Lenders**
constituting the “Instructing Group” as currently defined), which may include consents from lenders under future
term loan or revolving credit facilities, has been obtained. Certain of the VM Credit Facility Amendments will
only become effective only upon the approval of all affected lenders under the VM Credit Facility. Upon receipt
of the required consents from VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit Facility and the other creditors
under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the terms of
the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the VM Credit Facility and the Existing VM Senior
Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement will establish the relative rights of the
VM Credit Facility Lenders, the holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain creditors under
other financing arrangements of the Group.

The Lenders under VM Facility L and VM Facility M have irrevocably consented to the VM Credit Facility
Amendments set out in Schedule 4 of Annexes D, E and F to this offering memorandum, the Lenders under VM
Facility N and VM Facility O have irrevocably consented to the VM Credit Facility Amendments set out in
Schedules 4 and 5 of Annexes D, E and F to this offering memorandum and the Lenders under VM Facility P,

202


-----

VM Facility Q, VM Facility R, VM Facility S, VM Facility T and VM Facility U have irrevocably consented to
the VM Credit Facility Amendments set out in Schedules 4, 5 and 6 of Annexes D, E and F to this offering
memorandum. Upon entry into the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the Issuer will have consented to
the VM Credit Facility Amendments, and the commitments and loans of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility
Lender thereunder will also be included in those of the Lenders outstanding under the VM Credit Facility for the
purposes of implementation of the VM Credit Facility Amendments.

The VM Credit Facility Amendments include material modifications to certain affirmative and negative

Transaction Documents) shall cease to be a guarantor under the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing Facility
Agreement. The indebtedness under the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing Facility Agreement is unsecured.

_Repayments and Prepayments_

The VM Dollar Financing Excess Cash Loans will be repaid pursuant to prior notice from the Administrator
confirming that the Dollar VFN Issuer requires cash (i) for the purchase of receivables in connection with the

The VM Dollar Financing Interest Facility Loans will be repaid (or deemed repaid, as the case may be)
(i) pursuant to prior notice from the Administrator confirming that the Dollar VFN Issuer requires cash for
payment of interest due and payable on the 2020 Dollar Vendor Financing Notes (subject to the receipt of certain
shortfall payments due from VMIH in accordance with the terms of the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing
Facility Agreement), (ii) in an amount equal to a specified excess payment, if due and payable by the Dollar VFN
Issuer under the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing Facility Agreement, or (iii) pursuant to prior notice from

On the date of any repayment in connection with a payment of interest or redemption of all or part of the
2020 Dollar Vendor Financing Notes, VMIH will pay the amount of U.S. dollars required by the Dollar VFN
Issuer to make such payments (the “Required US Dollar Amount”) and the Dollar VFN Issuer will pay VMIH

In addition to the repayments described above, the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing Facility Agreement
contains provisions in relation to voluntary prepayment. VMIH may prepay all of the VM Dollar Financing
Facility Loans and cancel all of the Commitments of the Dollar VFN Issuer on three Business Days’ (or shorter
period as agreed by the Administrator) prior notice, subject to certain provisions (including the repayment of all
receivables assigned to the Dollar VFN Issuer pursuant to the platform documentation entered into in connection
with the VM Dollar Financing Transactions). Following receipt of notice from the Dollar VFN Issuer that a Tax
Event has occurred or will occur, on three Business Days’ (or shorter period as agreed by the Administrator)
prior notice, VMIH is permitted to prepay all of the VM Dollar Financing Facility Loans and cancel all of the
Commitments of the Dollar VFN Issuer, subject to certain provisions (including the repayment of all receivables
assigned to the Dollar VFN Issuer pursuant to the platform documentation entered into in connection with the
VM Dollar Financing Transactions). Additionally, for so long as a Drawstop Event has occurred and is
continuing, on three Business Days’ (or shorter period as agreed by the Administrator) prior notice, VMIH is
permitted to prepay all or part of the VM Dollar Financing Interest Facility Loans and/or VM Dollar Financing
Excess Cash Loans, but such prepayment shall not result in the cancellation of the Commitments of the Dollar
VFN Issuer. In connection with a partial redemption of the 2020 Dollar Vendor Financing Notes, VMIH may
partially prepay the VM Dollar Financing Excess Cash Loan and the VM Dollar Financing Interest Facility
Loans by giving three Business Days’ notice (or a shorter period as agreed by the Administrator). The VM Dollar
Financing Excess Cash Facility Commitment will be cancelled by a corresponding amount.

The VM Dollar Financing Facility will also need to be prepaid (including all receivables assigned to the
Dollar VFN Issuer pursuant to the platform documentation entered into in connection with the VM Dollar
Financing Transactions) on the occurrence of any illegality (as described in the 2020 Dollar Issuance VM
Financing Facility Agreement) subject to certain conditions.

_Automatic Cancellation_

Any unutilized amount of a VM Dollar Financing Facility will be automatically cancelled on the earlier of:
(i) the end of its Availability Period; and (ii) the redemption of all of the 2020 Dollar Vendor Financing Notes in
full.

_Events of Default_

The 2020 Dollar Issuance VM Financing Facility Agreement contains certain customary events of default
(each, an “VM Dollar Financing Facility Event of Default”), the occurrence of which, subject to certain agreed
exceptions, thresholds, materiality and grace periods, would allow the Dollar VFN Issuer (by notice to VMIH) to
(i) cancel the Total Commitments, (ii) accelerate all outstanding VM Dollar Financing Facility Loans,
(iii) declare that all or part of the VM Dollar Financing Facility Loans be payable on demand and/or (iv) exercise
any or all of its rights, remedies, powers or discretions under the VM Dollar Financing Facility Finance
Documents.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (the “Issuer”), will issue the Notes (as defined below) under the Indenture
(the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, between, among others, the Issuer and BNY Mellon
Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as Trustee and Security Trustee (each as defined below). You will find the
definitions of capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this description under the heading “—Certain
_Definitions”._

For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to:

(1) “Issuer” refer only to VMED O2 UK Financing I plc;

(2) “New VM Credit Facility Borrower” refer only to VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 Limited and not to any of its
subsidiaries;

(3) “Virgin Media” refer only to Virgin Media Inc., the indirect parent of VMIH (as defined below), and not to
any of its subsidiaries; and

(4) “VMIH” refer only to Virgin Media Investment Holdings Limited and not to any of its subsidiaries.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but the aggregate principal amount of Notes
issued in this offering is limited to £ % senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Sterling Notes”)
and $ % senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Dollar Notes” and, together with the Sterling
Notes, the “Notes”). The Issuer may issue an unlimited amount of Additional Notes (as defined below) having
identical terms and conditions to the Sterling Notes or the Dollar Notes (as applicable) under the Indenture. See
“—Principal, Maturity and Interest”.

Except as otherwise stated herein, the Notes will be treated as a single class of Notes under the Indenture,
including with respect to waivers and amendments. As a result, among other things, holders of the Notes will not
have separate and independent rights to give notice of a Default or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies in
the event of a Default with respect to the Notes or otherwise.

The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”).

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture, and refers to the VM Credit Facility, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the New Finco
Facility Deed of Covenant, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing
Agreement and the Notes Security Documents (each as defined below). As this “Description of the Notes” does
not restate those agreements in their entirety and is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture, the VM
Credit Facility, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the
New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and the Notes
Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your direct and indirect rights as holders of the
Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the VM Credit Facility, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the New
Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement and the Notes Security Documents are available as described elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The VM Credit Facility is attached as Annex A to this Offering Memorandum. Forms of the New
Finco Facility Deed of Covenant and the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements are attached as Annex B,
Annex D and Annex E to this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes will initially be held in registered global form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated
as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry
_Settlement and Clearance”._

**Summary Description of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into (i) an accession agreement to the VM Credit Facility, in
substantially the form attached as Annex D to this Offering Memorandum, with the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Agent (the “Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement”), pursuant to which
the Issuer will make available to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the VM
Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued in the
offering and (ii) an accession agreement to the VM Credit Facility, in substantially the form attached as Annex E

231


-----

to this Offering Memorandum, with the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Agent
(the “Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement”, and together with the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement, the
“New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”), pursuant to which the Issuer will make available to the New VM
Credit Facility Borrower an additional facility under the VM Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes issued in the offering.

The Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other VM Credit Facility Lenders
and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to
other VM Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the
Finco Loans (including the New Finco Loans (as defined below)) granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of
itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of
the Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a VM
Credit Facility Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in the VM Credit Facility, the
guarantees granted by the VM Credit Facility Guarantors and the VM Credit Facility Collateral. See “Description
_of the VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of the Bank_
Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) under the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same
way as the other VM Credit Facility Lenders, with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis
described in this “Description of the Notes” and to receive principal and interest on the New Finco Loans, which
it will in turn use to make payments on the Notes. For a description of procedures under the Indenture and the
New Finco Facility Accession Agreements relating to the voting rights of holders of the relevant series of Notes
with respect to decisions under the VM Credit Facility, see below under “—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver—To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”._

Under the VM Credit Facility, to the extent the Bank Group is in compliance with certain financial
covenants, the borrowers under the VM Credit Facility, at their discretion and without the consent of the VM
Credit Facility Lenders, are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to additional VM
Credit Facility Loans under the VM Credit Facility, which benefit from the protections provided to all VM Credit
Facility Lenders, including the representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security provided
thereunder. For a further description of the VM Credit Facility, see “Description of the VM Credit Facility and
_the Related Agreements”. The VM Credit Facility is attached as Annex A to this Offering Memorandum._

On the Issue Date, (i) the net proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Notes, together with the fees payable to
the Issuer (if any) from the New VM Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility $ Fee Letter, will be used
by the Issuer to fund a loan (the “Finco Loan $”) borrowed under an additional facility (the “Finco Facility $”)
established pursuant to the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement under the VM Credit Facility and (ii) the net
proceeds of the offering of the Sterling Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer (if any) from the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility £ Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund a loan (the
“Finco Loan £”, and together with the Finco Loan $, the “New Finco Loans”) borrowed under an additional
facility (the “Finco Facility £”, and together with the Finco Facility $, the “New Finco Facilities”) established
pursuant to the Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement under the VM Credit Facility, and the Issuer will become a
VM Credit Facility Lender.

The principal amount of the Dollar Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and
currency, among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan $ and the
principal amount of the Sterling Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan £.

As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions (including the borrowing of the New
Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds therefrom) as described in “Use of Proceeds”, £9.3 billion
(equivalent) principal amount of indebtedness would have been outstanding under the VM Credit Facility. See
“Capitalization of JV Holdco and the Issuer”. This amount includes £1,130.2 million (equivalent), or 12.2% of
the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the VM Credit Facility, representing the New Finco Loans.

In addition to indirect benefits arising from the protections and security afforded to the Issuer as a VM
Credit Facility Lender, holders of the Notes will also benefit directly from the security interests in the Collateral
(as described and defined below under “—Notes Collateral”). Further, if an Event of Default is continuing under
the Indenture or the Notes, holders of the Notes will be entitled to direct the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee
to enforce their rights under the Notes, the Indenture and, in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing

232


-----

Agreement, the Notes Security Documents, in which case the holders of the Notes will have multiple available
remedies (through the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as applicable), including declaring the Notes due and
payable.

For more information on Events of Default and Remedies, see “—Events of Default and Remedies” and
“—Collateral Sharing Agreement”.

**Certain Transaction Documents**

**_New Finco Facility Accession Agreements and the VM Credit Facility_**

On the Issue Date, in connection with the Finco Loan $, the Issuer, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower
and the VM Credit Facility Agent will enter into the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement and in connection
with the Finco Loan £, the Issuer, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower and the VM Credit Facility Agent will
enter into the Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement, pursuant to each of which the Issuer will accede to the VM
Credit Facility as a VM Credit Facility Lender. The Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement will set out the
principal economic terms of the Finco Facility $ and the Finco Loan $ and the form of the Finco Facility $
Accession Agreement is attached as Annex D to this Offering Memorandum. The Finco Facility £ Accession
Agreement will set out the principal economic terms of the Finco Facility £ and the Finco Loan £ and the form of
the Finco Facility £ Accession Agreement is attached as Annex E to this Offering Memorandum.

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Dollar Notes, together with fees payable to the Issuer (if any) by
the New VM Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the Finco Facility $ Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer on
the Issue Date to fund the Finco Loan $, denominated in U.S. dollars, to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower
under the Finco Facility $. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Sterling Notes, together with fees payable
to the Issuer (if any) by the New VM Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to the Finco Facility £ Fee Letter, will be
used by the Issuer on the Issue Date to fund the Finco Loan £, denominated in sterling, to the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower under the Finco Facility £.

On the Issue Date, upon acceding to the VM Credit Facility as a VM Credit Facility Lender pursuant to the
New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the Issuer will benefit from:

(1) all the rights of a VM Credit Facility Lender under the VM Credit Facility and the New Finco Facility
Accession Agreements, including the protections of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants and
events of default set out in the VM Credit Facility except in certain limited circumstances expressly outlined
in each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement or the VM Credit Facility. In particular, the financial
covenant set out in the VM Credit Facility shall not be for the benefit of the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility
Lender;

(2) rights under the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, pursuant to which the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower and VMIH will agree with the Issuer to comply (or procure the Issuer’s compliance) with the
covenants described below under “—Redemption and Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”, “—Redemption
_and Repurchase—Open Market Purchases of VM Credit Facility Loans”, “—Information”, “—Minimum_
_Period for Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents”, “—Payments for Consents” and_
“—Amendments to VM Credit Facility Loan Documents to be applied equally to all VM Credit Facility
_Lenders”;_

(3) rights under the New Finco Facility Fee Letters relating to certain fees payable to the Issuer in connection
with the entering into of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements and the advancing of the New Finco
Loans; and

(4) rights under the Expenses Agreement, pursuant to which VMIH will agree to pay (i) the fees and expenses
of the Issuer incurred from time to time in connection with or related to the Issuer’s performance of its
obligations under the Indenture and the maintenance of the Issuer’s existence, (ii) certain tax liabilities of
the Issuer, (iii) any Additional Amounts payable under the Indenture and (iv) any additional interest
required to be paid under the Notes on overdue principal and interest.

Subject to certain provisions to reflect the Transactions, each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement will
be similar in form to any accession agreement entered into by any other Additional Facility Lender (as defined in
the VM Credit Facility) and will include additional rights that are specific to the applicable New Finco Loan,
including the maturity date of, the rate of interest accruing on, and the interest periods applicable to such New
Finco Loan. In addition, each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement will provide for the payment of certain

233


-----

premiums in connection with certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the applicable New Finco Loan
that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums applicable to corresponding redemptions of the applicable Notes,
as described below under “—Redemption and Repurchase”. Each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement will
constitute a “Finance Document” for purposes of the VM Credit Facility.

Each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement will further provide that the Issuer will accede to the Group
Intercreditor Deed and the High Yield Intercreditor Deed as a VM Credit Facility Lender and will be bound by
the terms and provisions of the Group Intercreditor Deed and the High Yield Intercreditor Deed in its capacity as
a lender. See “Description of the Intercreditor Deeds”.

Under the VM Credit Facility, VM Credit Facility Lenders are not allowed to split or divide their votes with
respect to matters arising thereunder requiring the vote (or other consent) of VM Credit Facility Lenders. For a
description of procedures under the Indenture regarding voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to
decisions under the VM Credit Facility, see below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the VM
_Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”._

The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit
Facility. In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise
consent) (including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter arising from time to
time under the VM Credit Facility or under the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, as applicable, in
which all VM Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent), the
Issuer will solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the Notes and any other applicable series of
Additional Debt (including the Existing JV Notes) with respect to such VM Credit Facility Decision (as defined
below) in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment, Supplement
_and Waiver—To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements” and “—Certain_
_Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents”. However, the Issuer_
will, under (and effective as of the date of) each of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, on behalf of
the holders of the applicable Notes, provide its consent as a VM Credit Facility Lender, to any and all of the
amendments set forth in Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7 to each of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements (the
“VM Credit Facility Amendments”) (notwithstanding that the Issuer may otherwise be eligible to vote as a VM
Credit Facility Lender if the borrowers sought the consent of the VM Credit Facility Lenders with respect to such
matters). The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder Consent (as defined below) equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes outstanding in respect of any of the VM Credit Facility Amendments for the purposes of the
provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the VM Credit
_Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements” and “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for_
_Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents”. As a result, the Issuer will not solicit votes (or other_
consents) from the holders of the Notes with respect to the VM Credit Facility Amendments. In addition, the

The above description is intended to summarize certain material amendments included in the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements but is not a complete and exhaustive list of such amendments and does not restate
the proposed amendments listed in Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements in
their entirety. Given the significant nature of these amendments, you should read the full list of amendments set
out in Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements in their entirety before investing
in the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—By investing in the Notes you
_will have provided advance consent to the VM Credit Facility Amendments which will automatically become_
_effective without any further consent from holders of the Notes upon VMIH obtaining the consent of either the_
_Instructing Group (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) or, with respect to certain amendments, all VM Credit_
_Facility Lenders”._

The VM Credit Facility Amendments will generally become effective upon the approval by lenders
constituting the Instructing Group (as currently defined in the VM Credit Facility, without giving effect to the
VM Credit Facility Amendments). However, certain of the VM Credit Facility Amendments, including those
related to extending the date of any payment and releasing guarantors, will become effective only upon the
approval of all VM Credit Facility Lenders.

Upon receipt of the required consents from VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit Facility and
the other creditors under certain financing arrangements of the Group, the terms of the Group Intercreditor Deed
and the terms of the High Yield Intercreditor Deed will cease to govern the VM Credit Facility and the Existing
VM Senior Secured Notes and the terms of the New Group Intercreditor Agreement will establish the relative
rights of the VM Credit Facility Lenders, the holders of the Existing VM Senior Secured Notes and certain
creditors under other financing arrangements of the Group.

References in this “Description of the Notes” and the Indenture to numbered clauses or sections in the VM
Credit Facility refer to such clauses or sections as numbered as of the date of the Indenture and, in the event the
VM Credit Facility is amended or supplemented after the date of the Indenture, to any substantially similar clause
or section after such amendment or supplement whether numbered the same or differently after such amendment
or supplement.

**_Collateral Sharing Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Collateral Sharing Agreement that governs the relative
rights of creditors under the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and any Additional Debt of the Issuer that
benefits from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, all
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be shared on a pari passu basis by the holders of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) and the creditors of all Additional Debt of the Issuer that benefits from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. The Collateral Sharing Agreement sets out, among other things, (i) the
relevant ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, (ii) the consent level of the senior creditors required to cast votes
and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions and remedies under the Indenture, the Notes, the
Notes Security Documents and the other debt instruments or agreements sharing in the Collateral (including the
Existing JV Notes), when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the Collateral by the Security Trustee
and (iii) turnover provisions. The holders and/or lenders, as applicable, of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and all Additional Debt then outstanding will control any
enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral.

The New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the New Finco Facility
Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement and the Collateral Sharing Agreement are collectively referred to
herein as the “Transaction Documents”.

**Summary Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

      - will be senior and limited recourse obligations of the Issuer;

      - will be secured by the Collateral (as described under “—Notes Collateral”);

      - will rank pari passu in right of payment to all Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including any Additional Notes), including the
Existing Notes;

      - will be subject to the Limited Recourse Restrictions; and

      - will be effectively subordinated to any future Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured
by Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes, or secured by property and assets that do not
secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Financial
Indebtedness.

The Issuer will not be entitled to incur any additional Financial Indebtedness (other than Additional Notes
and any other Additional Debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Indenture). See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer”._

**_Notes Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, subject to limitations under applicable Law described elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, the holders of the Notes will benefit directly from security interests to be granted to the Security
Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the following rights, property and assets
(the “Collateral”):

(1) all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Finco Loans (including all rights of the Issuer as a VM
Credit Facility Lender under the VM Credit Facility and the Finco Facility Accession Agreements);

(2) all of the Issuer’s rights, title and interests in the Deeds of Covenant, the Fee Letters, the Expenses
Agreement (excluding any transaction fees payable to the Issuer pursuant thereto and the Issuer’s rights to
be indemnified in respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts payable to parties that do not
benefit from the security interests in the Collateral) and the Issue Date Amounts Loans; and

(3) all sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the Issuer (excluding any transaction fees

Collateral Sharing Agreement.

247


-----

The Security Trustee will enter into the Notes Security Documents relating to the Collateral described above
with the other relevant parties thereto. The security interests in the Collateral will secure the performance of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes as provided in the relevant Notes Security Document
and to the extent specified therein, subject to the provisions, among others, described below under “—Events of
_Default and Remedies” and “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”. Subject to certain conditions, including_
the compliance with the covenant described under “—Impairment of Liens”, the Issuer is permitted to pledge the
Collateral in connection with future issuances of Additional Debt, including any Additional Notes, in each case
permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Financial Indebtedness,
and the creditors (or representative thereof) of any such Additional Debt of the Issuer that will benefit from the
shared Collateral on a pari passu basis will become party to the Collateral Sharing Agreement. The Collateral
Sharing Agreement provides that the Liens in the Collateral may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the
amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default, subject to and in accordance with its terms. Neither
the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any
rights in their favor under the Notes Security Documents. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only take
action to enforce the Notes Security Documents through the Security Trustee and the Collateral Sharing
Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the ability of the Security Trustee to
enforce the Liens in the Collateral will be restricted and will be at the discretion of the relevant creditors.

The Notes Security Documents provide for the Security Trustee to release the security created thereby upon
discharge of the Indenture, in accordance with its terms, as described below under “—Release of the Collateral”.

_Release of the Collateral_

The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the
Notes;

(2) to release and/or re-take a lien on the Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture (including, without limitation, as may be permitted by the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Liens”);_

(3) with the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
(including without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or
purchase of, the Notes);

(4) following an Event of Default under the Indenture or a default under other Financial Indebtedness secured
by the Collateral, pursuant to an enforcement in accordance with the Collateral Sharing Agreement; and

(5) upon satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as provided below under the caption “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”._

Upon certification by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Collateral Sharing Agreement, to effectuate any release in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications to the satisfaction of the
Trustee and the Security Trustee. The Security Trustee and/or Trustee (as applicable) will agree to any release of
the security interests created by the Notes Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes
Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders.

**_Limited Recourse Obligations_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be
limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the Issuer under the Indenture (including any
Additional Amounts), the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be made only from and to the extent of
such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Security Trustee under the
Collateral, including the Issuer’s rights under the VM Credit Facility and the Transaction Documents and none of
the Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Registrar (as defined below), any Paying Agent (as defined below) or the
holders of the Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event that the amount
due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents exceeds the
amounts so received or recovered under the Collateral, including the Issuer’s rights under the VM Credit Facility
and the Transaction Documents (the “Limited Recourse Restrictions”).

248


-----

Holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of any other member of the Bank
Group and no other member of the Bank Group will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay
amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of the New VM Credit Facility Borrower, VMIH and the other VM Credit Facility Guarantors, as
applicable, to make payments to VM Credit Facility Lenders under the VM Credit Facility, the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters and the Expenses Agreement.

Because the holders of the Notes will benefit from the assignment of rights under certain agreements
between the Issuer and members of the Bank Group, in certain circumstances described below under “—Events
_of Default and Remedies”, the Security Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, will be able to assert the_
contractual rights of the Issuer against members of the Bank Group, subject to any limitations set forth in the VM
Credit Facility (and in an enforcement action holders of the Notes may instruct the Security Trustee to demand
such performance). However, these rights are limited to the Issuer’s contractual rights against any member of the
Bank Group and provide for no direct claims into any other member of the Bank Group.

No VM Credit Facility Guarantor or any of their subsidiaries will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under
the Notes.

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer has been formed as a financing company for the purposes of issuing the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) and any other Additional Debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Indenture. The
Issuer has no material business operations and upon completion of this offering will have no material assets other
than the New Finco Loans to be advanced in connection with the offering of the Notes as described below under
“—New Finco Facility Accession Agreements and the VM Credit Facility”, its rights under the Transaction
Documents and its rights under the Existing Finco Loans and certain other related agreements. As a result, the
Issuer will be primarily dependent on payments by the New VM Credit Facility Borrower under the New Finco
Loans in order to service its obligations under the Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue in this offering $ in aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes and £ in
aggregate principal amount of Sterling Notes. The Issuer may issue additional Dollar Notes (the “Additional
**Dollar Notes”) and/or additional Sterling Notes (the “Additional Sterling Notes”, and together with the**
Additional Dollar Notes, the “Additional Notes”) under the Indenture from time to time after this offering. Any
issuance of Additional Notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture. The Dollar Notes issued in
this offering and any Additional Dollar Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as part of
the same issue as the Dollar Notes issued in this offering for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, consents, other determinations, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as
otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Sterling Notes issued in this offering and any Additional Sterling Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as part of the same issue as the Sterling Notes issued in
this offering for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, consents,
other determinations, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. Any
reference to (i) “Notes” in this “Description of the Notes” shall be deemed to include any Additional Notes, (ii)
“Dollar Notes” in this “Description of the Notes” shall be deemed to include any Additional Dollar Notes and
(iii) “Sterling Notes” in this “Description of the Notes” shall be deemed to include any Additional Sterling
Notes. In connection with the issuance of Additional Dollar Notes, the Issuer and the New VM Credit Facility
Borrower will upsize Finco Loan $ pursuant to an increase confirmation or an accession agreement or enter into
one or more accession agreements under the VM Credit Facility, each of which will constitute a “Finco Facility
**Accession Agreement” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents. In connection with the issuance of**
Additional Sterling Notes, the Issuer and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will upsize Finco Loan £
pursuant to an increase confirmation or an accession agreement or will enter into one or more accession
agreements under the VM Credit Facility, each of which will constitute a “Finco Facility Accession
**Agreement” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents. The proceeds of any such Additional Notes**
will be loaned to the New VM Credit Facility Borrower pursuant to a loan under such Finco Facility Accession
Agreement and each such loan will constitute a “Finco Loan” for purposes of the Indenture and related
documents. Consideration for any Additional Notes may be paid in cash or otherwise.

The Issuer will issue Dollar Notes in minimum denominations of $200,000 principal amount and integral

The Dollar Notes will mature on July 15, 2031 and the Sterling Notes will mature on July 15, 2031.

Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in U.S.
dollars semi-annually in arrear on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2022. Interest on the
Sterling Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in sterling semi-annually in
arrear on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2022.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or the last interest payment date, as applicable. Interest
on overdue principal and interest then due will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher than the then applicable
interest rate on the relevant series of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Expenses Agreement described
above, VMIH will make payments to the Issuer to enable it to pay the additional interest required to be paid
under the applicable series of Notes on overdue principal and interest. The Issuer will make each interest
payment for so long as the Notes are Global Notes (as defined below) to the holders of record of the Notes at the
close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on the Clearing System Business Day immediately before the
due date for such payment, where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each clearing system
for which the Global Note is being held is open for business, or, to the extent Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined below) have been issued, to the holders of record of the applicable Notes on the immediately preceding
January 1 and July 1. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months.

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at
the corporate trust office or agency of the Paying Agent in London, England except that, at the option of the
Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the holders of the Notes as such
address appears in the Note register. Payments on the Sterling Global Notes (as defined below) will be made to
the common depositary or its nominee as the registered holder of the Sterling Global Notes and payments on the
Dollar Global Notes (as defined below) will be made to Cede & Co. as the registered holder of the Dollar Global
Notes.

The rights of holders to receive the payments of principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional
Amounts, if any, on such Global Notes are subject to applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream.

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes issued in certificated
non-global form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in London,
England, except that, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address
of the holders of Definitive Registered Notes as such address appears in the register for Definitive Registered
Notes. The Issuer will pay interest on Definitive Registered Notes to persons who are registered holders at the
close of business on the record date immediately preceding the interest payment date for such interest. Such
holders must surrender their Definitive Registered Notes to the applicable Paying Agent to collect principal
payments.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the holders thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

**Paying Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”). The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch will initially act as Paying Agent.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar for each series of Notes (each, a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar
for the Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch. The Issuer will also maintain a
transfer agent. The initial transfer agent with respect to the Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
Dublin Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register on behalf of the Issuer for so long as the Notes remain
outstanding reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time. The Paying
Agents will facilitate payments on the Notes, and the transfer agents will facilitate transfer of Definitive
Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. In the event that the Notes are no longer listed, the Issuer or its agent
will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes.

250


-----

The Issuer may change a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
holders of the Notes, and the Issuer may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes. In the
event that a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent is replaced, the Issuer will provide notice thereof in
accordance with the procedures described under “—Notices”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest coupons
attached, as follows:

    - Each series of Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the
meaning of Rule 144A that are also “qualified purchasers” within the meaning of section 2(a)(51) of
the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (each, a “Qualified Purchaser”), pursuant to
Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”):

       - The 144A Global Notes representing Dollar Notes (the “Dollar 144A Global Notes”) will, on the
Issue Date, be deposited with a custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

       - The 144A Global Notes representing Sterling Notes (the “Sterling 144A Global Notes”), will, on
the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of a nominee of the common depositary.

    - Each series of Notes sold to non-US persons in offshore transactions outside the United States pursuant
to (and as defined in) Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more temporary global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”):

       - The Regulation S Temporary Global Notes representing Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S
**Temporary Global Notes”) will initially be credited within DTC for the accounts of Euroclear**
and Clearstream.

       - The Regulation S Temporary Global Notes representing Sterling Notes (the “Sterling Regulation
**S Temporary Global Notes”) will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary**
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of a nominee of the
common depositary.

Through and including the 40th day after the closing of this offering (such period, through and including
such 40th day, the “distribution compliance period” as defined in Regulation S), beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (as indirect
participants in DTC with respect to the Dollar Regulation S Temporary Global Notes) unless transferred to a
person that takes delivery through a 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements
described under “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance—Transfers”. After the expiration of the distribution
compliance period the Dollar Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more
permanent global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Dollar Regulation S
**Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the “Dollar**
**Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar 144A Global Notes, the “Dollar Global Notes”) and**
the Sterling Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Sterling Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and,
together with the Sterling Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the “Sterling Regulation S Global Notes”
and, together with the Sterling 144A Global Notes, the “Sterling Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”), with no further action by the Issuer. After the 40-day distribution compliance
period ends, investors may also hold their interests in the Dollar Regulation S Permanent Global Notes through
organizations other than Clearstream or Euroclear that are DTC participants. The Dollar Regulation S Permanent
Global Notes and the Sterling Regulation S Permanent Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the
“Regulation S Permanent Global Notes”. The term “Regulation S Global Notes” as used herein shall refer to
either Regulation S Temporary Global Notes or the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes, as the context
requires.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under

251


-----

“Transfer Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC, participants
in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of Book-Entry Interests in the applicable Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities Law of any other jurisdiction._

Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the applicable 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A that is also a Qualified Purchaser in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise
in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities Law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000
principal amount or $200,000 principal amount, as the case may be, and integral multiples of £1,000 or $1,000,
as the case may be, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and
any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions
will be based upon directions received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant
which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance
with applicable Law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized
below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Sterling Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof and Dollar Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal amount
and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties
and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be
made without charge to the holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection
with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Definitive Registered Note:

(1) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 calendar days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to any interest payment date; or

(4) for any period during which the registered holder of a Note has tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with an Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the transfer agents will
be entitled to treat the registered holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

252

**Security Trustee**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited will act as Security Trustee under the Notes Security
Documents until such time, if any, that a new Security Trustee is appointed under the relevant provisions of the
Indenture.

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Trustee nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of any
property securing the Notes, for the legality, enforceability, effectiveness or sufficiency of the Notes Security
Documents, for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any security interest under any
Notes Security Document, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such matters, or for any failure to demand,
collect, foreclose or realize upon or otherwise enforce any of the Notes Security Documents or any delay in doing
so.

**Redemption and Repurchase**

**_Disposal Proceeds_**

Under the VM Credit Facility, VMIH is required to prepay, or to procure the prepayment of (in either case,
unless otherwise waived in accordance with the provisions of the VM Credit Facility), the VM Credit Facility
Loans in relation to Term Facilities (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) under the VM Credit Facility with
certain proceeds of asset disposals (“Disposal Proceeds”), subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the
_VM Credit Facility and the Related Agreements—VM Credit Facility—Principal Terms and Tranches—_
_Mandatory Prepayment”. VMIH may elect which VM Credit Facility Loans are to be prepaid in connection with_
any mandatory prepayment with Disposal Proceeds. Under the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the New
VM Credit Facility Borrower and VMIH will agree that, with respect to each New Finco Loan and any Disposal
Proceeds that are required to be applied to prepay any VM Credit Facility Loans in relation to Term Facilities
pursuant to Clause 12.2 (Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) of the VM Credit Facility, an amount
of such Disposal Proceeds that bears the same proportion to the total Disposal Proceeds as the aggregate
principal amount that the New Finco Loans bear to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding VM Credit
Facility Loans under Term Facilities (the “Available Disposal Proceeds”) will be available for prepayment of
such New Finco Loans.

In respect of the Available Disposal Proceeds, VMIH and/or the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will
elect, at their option:

(1) to offer to prepay (i) a principal amount of the Finco Loan $ equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the
relevant Available Disposal Proceeds on a pro rata basis with the other New Finco Loans and (b) the
aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes tendered in an Asset Sale Offer to be made by the Issuer
following receipt of notice from VMIH as set forth below and (ii) a principal amount of the Finco Loan £
equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the relevant Available Disposal Proceeds on a pro rata basis with the
other New Finco Loans and (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes tendered in an Asset
Sale Offer to be made by the Issuer following receipt of notice from VMIH as set forth below; or

(2) to prepay the New Finco Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to the relevant Available Disposal
Proceeds, in which case the Issuer will redeem (i) an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes equal
to the amount of the Finco Loan $ prepaid and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes equal
to the amount of the Finco Loan £ prepaid,

in each case, as described below.

_Asset Sale Offer_

Following receipt of notice of an asset disposal from VMIH delivered pursuant to the New Finco Facility
Deed of Covenant, the Issuer will, within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, make an offer to all
holders of the Notes (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of the relevant series of
Notes that may be purchased out of the Available Disposal Proceeds stated in such notice at an offer price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, which offer price will be payable in cash.

253


-----

Under the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, VMIH and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower have
agreed to pay (or procure the payment of) an amount of the New Finco Loans based on the aggregate principal
amount of the relevant series of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer equal to the lesser of (i) the relevant
Available Disposal Proceeds on a pro rata basis and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in
such Asset Sale Offer, and the Issuer will accept for purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Notes
in such Asset Sale Offer. The Issuer will apply any such prepayment of the New Finco Loans, together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, to pay the purchase price of all
Notes accepted for purchase in such Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee and VMIH of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant
series of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer. If the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of
Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the relevant amount of the Available Disposal Proceeds, the
Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased based on the amounts tendered on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of
Global Notes, based on the procedures of the applicable depository).

The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange
Act, and any other applicable securities Laws or regulations in connection with an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent
that the provisions of any applicable securities Laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant
(other than the obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the Issuer will comply with such securities
Laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by
virtue thereof.

_Redemption with Disposal Proceeds_

Under the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, if the New VM Credit Facility Borrower or VMIH elects
not to offer to prepay the relevant New Finco Loans in an amount equal to the lesser of the relevant Available
Disposal Proceeds and the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of Notes tendered in a related Asset
Sale Offer, it is required to prepay (or procure the payment of) the relevant New Finco Loans in an amount equal
to the Available Disposal Proceeds, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the relevant New Finco Loans at the
applicable price for any voluntary prepayment to, but excluding, the date of prepayment. The New VM Credit
Facility Borrower or VMIH is required to give not less than 10 Business Days’ notice of any such prepayment.
Any prepayment pursuant to this provision shall be pro rata across the New Finco Loans.

Following receipt of prepayment of the New Finco Loans described in the preceding paragraph, the Issuer
will promptly redeem an aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of Notes equal to the redemption price
that would be payable if such Notes were redeemed on such date pursuant to the provisions described below
under “—Optional Redemption”, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

**_Redemption upon a Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of any mandatory prepayment of any or all of New Finco Loans following a Change of
Control (as defined under Clause 12.1 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation—Change of Control) of the
VM Credit Facility), the Issuer will redeem the corresponding aggregate principal amount of the relevant series
of Notes, subject to and in accordance with the notice provisions of the VM Credit Facility, at a redemption price
equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the
relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date.

Under the terms of the VM Credit Facility, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the VM Credit
Facility Loans thereunder (including each New Finco Loan) will only become due and payable if the Instructing
Group so requires. The Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, will be entitled to vote the New Finco Loans in
accordance with the provisions described below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the VM
_Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements”. Depending on how the other VM Credit_
Facility Lenders vote in the determination of whether to require prepayment, holders of the Notes may have no
right to demand redemption of the Notes by the Issuer following the occurrence of a Change of Control.

254

**_Optional Redemption_**

In the event that all or any portion of any New Finco Loan is voluntarily prepaid by the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the VM Credit Facility (an “Early
**Redemption Event”), subject to and in accordance with the terms of the VM Credit Facility and the applicable**
New Finco Facility Accession Agreement, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements will provide for the

redemption price of % of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes redeemed, and/or (ii) up to 40% of

256


-----

the original aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes (including Additional Sterling Notes, if any) equal
to the principal amount of the Finco Loan £ prepaid with any Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds in
such Early Redemption Event, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price
of % of the principal amount of the Sterling Notes redeemed, in each case plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided that:_

(1) at least 50% of the principal amount of each of the Dollar Notes and the Sterling Notes, as applicable
(which, in each case, includes Additional Dollar Notes and Additional Sterling Notes, if any), issued under
the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after any such redemption; and

(2) the Issuer makes such redemption not more than 180 days after the consummation of any such Equity
Offering.

**_Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

Upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event effected at any time following the occurrence of an
Issuer Tax Event or an optional prepayment of a New Finco Loan pursuant to Clause 10.4 (Right of Repayment
_and Cancellation in Relation to a Single Lender) of the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer may redeem the relevant_
series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice
to the holders of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption
Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if, in the case of an Issuer Tax Event only, the Issuer determines
that as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the Laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such Laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction)
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the relevant Payor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Notes would
be, required to pay more than de minimis Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to it (which reasonable measures include, without limitation, the appointment of a
new or additional paying agent in another jurisdiction and not including changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer).
The Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum (or, if the
relevant jurisdiction was not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on such date, the date on which such jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be
published in accordance with the procedures described in the Indenture as described under “—Selection and
_Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior_
to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and
(b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.
Prior to the publication, delivery or mailing of any notice of redemption of the relevant series of Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee: (i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled
to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right
to so redeem have been satisfied and that it cannot avoid the obligations to pay Additional Amounts by taking
reasonable measures available to it; and (ii) an opinion of an independent tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee to the effect that the circumstances referred to above exist.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the existence of
satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the holders of the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Issuer after such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

257

**_Open Market Purchases of VM Credit Facility Loans_**

In the event that any member of the Bank Group makes any offer to purchase or otherwise acquire any VM
Credit Facility Loans (whether through a tender offer process or other process) at a price below the relevant
prevailing market price for such VM Credit Facility Loans, and such offer includes all or a portion of the New
Finco Loans held by the Issuer, the Issuer or any other member of the Bank Group shall make a
contemporaneous offer to purchase some or all of the applicable Notes on substantially similar terms as the offer
to purchase the applicable New Finco Loans; provided that (1) in no event will holders of such Notes be required
to participate in any such offer, (2) the consideration offered to holders of the applicable Notes will not be less
than the consideration they would have received as VM Credit Facility Lenders in connection with such offer to
purchase the applicable VM Credit Facility Loans and (3) VMIH and/or the Issuer shall have confirmed to the
Trustee that such purchases will not result in taxable income for the Issuer, including upon the extinguishment of
Financial Indebtedness in connection therewith, or that VMIH will have agreed to pay (directly or indirectly)
such income tax payable. Prior to undertaking any such purchases, one or more members of the Bank Group will
enter into arrangements providing for the payment of any fees and expenses incurred in connection with any such
offer.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase for the Notes or any series of Notes, if holders
of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or series of Notes, as
applicable, validly tender and do not properly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes or such series of Notes, as
applicable, validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have
the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes
or such series of Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the
price paid to each other holder of the applicable Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

Under the Finco Loan $, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will be obligated to prepay (or procure the
prepayment of) a principal amount of the Finco Loan $ in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes tendered in any such tender offer at a price equal to the applicable tender offer or redemption
price, and the Issuer will accept for purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes in such
tender offer. The Issuer will apply any such prepayment of the Finco Loan $ together with all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Finco Loan $ to, but excluding, the date of prepayment and/or redemption, to pay the purchase
price of all Dollar Notes accepted for purchase in such tender offer or the redemption price following such tender
offer. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee, VMIH and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower of the
aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes tendered in such tender offer.

Under the Finco Loan £, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will be obligated to prepay (or procure the
prepayment of) a principal amount of the Finco Loan £ in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Sterling Notes tendered in any such tender offer at a price equal to the applicable tender offer or redemption
price, and the Issuer will accept for purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes in such
tender offer. The Issuer will apply any such prepayment of the Finco Loan £ together with all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Finco Loan £ to, but excluding, the date of prepayment and/or redemption, to pay the purchase
price of all Sterling Notes accepted for purchase in such tender offer or the redemption price following such
tender offer. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee, VMIH and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower of the
aggregate principal amount of Sterling Notes tendered in such tender offer.

**_Selection and Notice_**

In the case of any partial redemption or offer to purchase, selection of the Notes for redemption or purchase
will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, based on the procedures of the
applicable depository) unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange or depositary
requirements, although no Sterling Notes of £100,000 or less or Dollar Notes of $200,000 or less can be
redeemed in part. The Trustee will not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph. If
any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part only, the notice of redemption or purchase relating to such Note
will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed or purchased. A new Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Note.

258


-----

For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, notices
may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled
account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

In each case above, any redemption, purchase and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including that the Issuer has received or any Paying Agent has
received from the Issuer sufficient funds to pay the full redemption or purchase price payable to holders of the
applicable Notes on or before the relevant redemption or repurchase date. If such redemption, purchase or notice
is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any
or all such conditions shall not have been, or in the good faith judgment of the Issuer are not likely to be, satisfied
by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. For the avoidance
of doubt each series of Notes may be redeemed or purchased either together or separately.

If a redemption or purchase date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day
that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on
such redemption or purchase date if it were a Business Day for the intervening period. If the redemption or
purchase date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name the applicable Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption or purchase.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any successor thereto (a “Payor”) on or with respect to
the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes
(including interest or penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer to timely pay amounts due),
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by Law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the government of the U.K. or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax
purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes (an “Issuer Tax Event”),
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder, as the case may be, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts) equal the amounts
which would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:_

(a) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes (other than the mere ownership or holding of such Note or enforcement of rights
thereunder or under the Indenture or the receipt of payments in respect thereof);

(b) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder had made a declaration of non-residence
or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that (i) such declaration of
non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by the applicable Law of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a
part of any such Taxes and (ii) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which

259


-----

such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required under the
applicable Law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that time has been notified
(in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture) by the Payor or any other person through
whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption
is required to be made, but only to the extent the holder is legally entitled to provide such declaration,
claim or filing);

(c) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);

(d) any Taxes that are payable, otherwise than by withholding, from a payment on the principal of,
redemption price of, premium, if any, or interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(e) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(f) all United States backup withholding taxes;

(g) any withholding or deduction imposed pursuant to (i) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any current or future
regulations or official interpretations thereof, (ii) any treaty, Law, regulation or other official guidance
enacted in any other jurisdiction, or relating to an intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and any other jurisdiction, which (in either case) facilitates the implementation of (i) above or
(iii) any agreement pursuant to the implementation of (i) or (ii) above with the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service, the U.S. government or any governmental or taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the
holder of the Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses
(a) to (h) inclusive above.

The Payor will (1) make any required withholding or deduction and (2) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable Law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies (or,
if certified copies are not available despite reasonable efforts of the Payor, other evidence of payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee) to each holder. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or other evidence) a
certificate stating (a) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (b) the amount of
such withholding Taxes paid per £1,000 or $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be. Copies of
such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Trustee by
the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent if the Notes
are then listed on the Exchange.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to
such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts
with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and each Paying Agent an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set
forth such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agents or Trustee, as applicable, to pay such
Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until
receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters. The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on each such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever mentioned in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes”, in any context: (1) the
payment of principal, (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes, (3) interest, or (4) any other
amount payable on or with respect to the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional
Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

260


-----

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies (including interest and penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer
to timely pay amounts due) which arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any
Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt
of any payments with respect to the Notes, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction in which a Paying Agent is located,
other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the
Collateral or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or resident for tax
purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

In the event the Payor is required to pay Additional Amounts, pursuant to the terms of the Expenses
Agreement, VMIH will pay to the Payor an amount in cash equal to such Additional Amounts to enable the
Payor to make such payment.

Bank Group.

Subject to the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, whenever
the Issuer receives a payment or prepayment under the New Finco Loans, it shall use the funds received solely to
satisfy its obligations (to the extent of the amount owing in respect of such obligations) under the Indenture
(including any premium payable to holders of the Notes).

**_Maintenance of the Existence of the Issuer_**

The Issuer shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its
corporate existence, in accordance with its constitutional documents (as the same may be amended from time to
time) and the rights (contractual and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Issuer.

**_Minimum Period for Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents_**

In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender under the New Finco Loans, is eligible or

The Issuer will distribute, or cause to be distributed, to holders of the relevant series of Notes and all holders of
Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note or otherwise make available (including through the facilities of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream or via an Internet web site or an electronic information provider, as applicable) all

Facility Amendments, unless (i) such consideration is also offered to be paid to the Issuer (as a VM Credit
Facility Lender) in respect of the New Finco Loans on a pro rata basis and (ii) if the Issuer consents, waives or
agrees to such consent, waiver or amendment in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described below

262


-----

under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession
_Agreements” in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating thereto (including any amendment_
or supplement thereto), the Issuer is paid such consideration. The Issuer will promptly pay any such
consideration received by it to all consenting holders of the relevant series of Notes on a pro rata basis.

**_Amendments to VM Credit Facility Loan Documents to be applied equally to all VM Credit Facility Lenders_**

The Issuer will procure that no member of the Bank Group will amend, waive or supplement any VM Credit

amendment, waiver or supplement that does not adversely affect the rights of the Issuer or the holders of the
relevant series of Notes in any material respect, (c) any amendment, waiver or supplement consented to by

subject to the majority consent provisions described thereunder or (d) such amendment, waiver or supplement
that has been consented to by the requisite VM Credit Facility Lenders (as determined in accordance with the
VM Credit Facility), including the Issuer, but irrespective of whether the Issuer, acting on the instructions of the
holders of the relevant series of Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, has voted in favor of the
amendment, waiver, or supplement.

**_Information_**

For so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period in which the Issuer is neither subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder,
the Issuer shall furnish to the holders of the Notes and to prospective purchasers of the Notes, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Upon receipt from VMIH or the VM Credit Facility Agent of any report or other information pursuant to the
terms of or in respect of the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer will promptly (and in any event, within three Business
Days of receipt) deliver any such report or other information to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all
holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note; provided that to the extent any reports are filed on the SEC’s
website, the Group Reporting Entity’s website or the Ultimate Parent’s website, such reports shall be deemed to
be furnished to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note. In
the event such reports or other information are furnished by or at the direction of VMIH or the VM Credit
Facility Agent to “public” VM Credit Facility Lenders via an Internet website or an electronic information
provider, the Issuer shall procure that the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry
Interests in a Global Note are granted access to such website or electronic information provider in order to
receive such reports or other information at the same time as other “public” VM Credit Facility Lenders.

The Issuer or VMIH will provide to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry
Interests in a Global Note (provided, however, that to the extent any reports are filed on the SEC’s website, the
Group Reporting Entity’s website or the Ultimate Parent’s website, such reports shall be deemed to be furnished
to the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note), within 150 days
after the end of each fiscal year ending subsequent to the Issue Date, the audited consolidated statements of
financial positions of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years (or such shorter period as the
Issuer has been in existence) and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the
Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years (or such shorter period as the Issuer has been in existence), in each
case prepared in accordance with GAAP, IFRS or Local GAAP (such reporting standard, the “Initial Reporting
**Standard”), including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements and a report of the independent auditors**
on the financial statements. At any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to apply for all purposes of the
Indenture, in lieu of the Initial Reporting Standard, any of GAAP, IFRS or Local GAAP (the “New Reporting
**Standard”) and, upon such election, (1) all financial statements and reports to be provided, after such election,**
pursuant to the Indenture shall be prepared on the basis of the New Reporting Standard as in effect from time to
time (including that, upon first reporting its fiscal year results under the New Reporting Standard, the Issuer shall
restate its financial statements on the basis of the New Reporting Standard for the fiscal year ending immediately
prior to the first fiscal year for which financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the New Reporting
Standard), and (2) from and after such election, all ratios, computations, and other determinations based on Initial
Reporting Standard contained in the Indenture shall be computed in conformity with the New Reporting Standard
with retroactive effect being given thereto assuming that such election had been made on the Issue Date.

263


-----

The Issuer or VMIH is required to deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default
that is, in each case, continuing, the Issuer or VMIH is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement within 30
days of becoming aware of such event specifying such Default or Event of Default and the action that is being
taken in respect of such Default or Event of Default. The Issuer or VMIH will promptly (or within any time
periods prescribed) notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests
in a Global Note upon becoming aware of any Default (as defined in the VM Credit Facility as then in effect)
under the VM Credit Facility or the Transaction Documents.

**_Impairment of Liens_**

The Issuer shall not take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing any
Lien in the Collateral granted under the Notes Security Documents (it being understood, subject to the proviso
below, that the incurrence of Permitted Issuer Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
any Lien in the Collateral granted under the Notes Security Documents) for the benefit of the Trustee, the
Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Issuer shall not grant to any Person other than the Security
Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other
beneficiaries described in the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (a) the Issuer may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Notes Security Document
for the purposes of incurring Permitted Issuer Liens, (b) the Collateral may be discharged and released in
accordance with the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, (c) the applicable Notes Security Documents may be amended from
time to time to cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect or inconsistency therein, (d) the Issuer may
release any Lien on any properties and assets constituting Collateral under the Notes Security Documents,
_provided that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent re-taking of a Lien of at least equivalent_
priority over the same properties and assets securing the Notes, and (e) the Issuer may make any other change
that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect. For any amendments,
modifications or replacements of any Notes Security Documents or Liens not contemplated in clauses (a) to
(e) above, the Issuer or the relevant Grantor shall contemporaneously with any such action deliver to the Trustee
and the Security Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Security Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer or
the relevant Grantor (as applicable) after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, (ii) a certificate from the responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer or the relevant Grantor (acting in good faith) which confirms the solvency of the
person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Notes Security Documents, as applicable, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications from the Issuer) consent to any
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the holders of the Notes.

**Collateral Sharing Agreement; Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement**

The Trustee will become party to the Collateral Sharing Agreement on the Issue Date, and each holder of a
Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have (i) authorized and directed the Trustee and Security
Trustee to enter into the Collateral Sharing Agreement, (ii) agreed to be bound by all the terms and provisions of
the Collateral Sharing Agreement applicable to such holder and (iii) irrevocably appointed and directed each of
the Trustee and the Security Trustee to act on its behalf and to perform the duties and exercise the rights and
powers that are specifically given to them under the Collateral Sharing Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the incurrence by the Issuer
of any Financial Indebtedness that is permitted to share the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted
Issuer Liens, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such Financial

264


-----

Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) a collateral sharing agreement, including an accession to
or a restatement, amendment or other modification of an existing collateral sharing agreement (including an
amendment, restatement or modification of the Collateral Sharing Agreement) (an “Additional Collateral
**Sharing Agreement”), on substantially the same terms (other than, prior to a CSA Enforcement Event (as**
defined below), with respect to rights to provide notice or instructions or other administrative matters) as the
Collateral Sharing Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes) including with
respect to the subordination, payment blockage, priority and release of any Lien in respect of the Collateral or
other terms which become customary for similar agreements; provided that such Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Trustee or adversely affect the
personal rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Trustee under the Indenture or the
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the
Security Trustee will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement
and/or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect
or inconsistency therein; (ii) add other parties (such as representatives of new issuances of Financial
Indebtedness) thereto; (iii) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (iv) make provision for equal
and ratable grants of Liens on the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Issuer
Liens; (v) make any other change to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or such Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement to provide for additional Financial Indebtedness or other obligations that are permitted by the terms
of the Indenture to be incurred and secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Liens
securing the Notes; (vi) amend the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; (vii) implement any transaction in connection with the renewal,
extension, refinancing, replacement or increase of any Financial Indebtedness that is not prohibited by the
Indenture; or (viii) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the
Notes in any material respect; provided that no such changes shall be permitted to the extent they affect the
ranking of any Note, enforcement of Liens over the Collateral, the application of proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral or the release of any Liens over the Collateral in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
of the holders of the Notes in any material respect except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement immediately prior to such change. The
Issuer will not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional Collateral sharing Agreement, without the consent of the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, except as described above or
otherwise permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Indenture and the Notes”, and
the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement.

Each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(a) appointed, authorized and directed the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee from time to time to give effect to
such provisions;

(b) authorized and directed each of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee from time to time to become a party
to any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement and any document giving effect to such amendments to the
Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement;

(c) agreed to be bound by such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement
and any document giving effect to such amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement; and

(d) irrevocably appointed and directed the Trustee and the Security Trustee to act on its behalf from time to
time to enter into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement and any document giving effect to such amendments to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any
Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement,

in each case, without the need for the consent of the holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Collateral Sharing Agreement or an Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders of the Notes to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the Indenture.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

**_Events of Default_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note when due, which has continued for
30 days;

(2) default for one Business Day in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on any Note;

(3) failure by the Issuer to comply with Clauses (4), (5), (6) or (10) under the captions “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer” or the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—_
_Maintenance of the Existence of the Issuer” or “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under_
_VM Credit Facility Loan Documents”;_

(4) failure by the Issuer for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture
(other than those described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) or the Notes; provided that the Issuer shall have
90 days after receipt of such notice to remedy, or receive a waiver for, any failure to comply with the
obligations to file annual reports or provide other reports or information in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Information” so long as the Issuer is attempting to cure such failure as promptly as
reasonably practicable;

(5) breach by the Issuer of any material representation or warranty in any Notes Security Document to which it
is a party and such breach is not remedied within 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, the repudiation by the
Issuer of any of its obligations under any Notes Security Document to which it is a party or the
unenforceability for any reason against the Issuer of any Notes Security Document to which it is a party;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Issuer;

(7) (a) failure by any party thereto for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in the
New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement or the New Finco Facility Fee Letters in
any material respect or (b) the repudiation by any party thereto of any of its obligations under any of the
New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement or the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the
unenforceability for any reason against any party thereto of the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the
Expenses Agreement or the New Finco Facility Fee Letters or any breach by any party thereto of any
material representation or warranty in the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Expenses Agreement
or the New Finco Facility Fee Letters; or

(8) (a) the occurrence of a VM Event of Default that is continuing or (b) any breach by the New VM Credit
Facility Borrower of any material representation or warranty or any material agreement in the New Finco
Facility Accession Agreements and such breach is not remedied within 60 days after notice to the Issuer by
the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, as
applicable.

For purposes of clause (8) above, “VM Event of Default” means an “Event of Default” as defined in the
VM Credit Facility (including in respect of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements) as then in effect.

**_Remedies_**

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional
Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of
Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Any notice of
Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or
Event of Default or notice of acceleration, or to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event

266


-----

of Default, may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two
years prior to such notice or instruction. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may waive all past defaults (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium,
interest or Additional Amounts) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences
if (a) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, (b) all
existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have
been cured or waived and (c) the Issuer has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the
Trustee for its reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances.

Following acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, the
Lien over the Collateral will become enforceable, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement (a “CSA Enforcement Event”). Following
a CSA Enforcement Event under the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement, pursuant to each New Finco Facility Accession Agreement, the New VM Credit Facility Borrower
will consent to any assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations (in whole or in part) of each New
Finco Loan, including any subsequent assignment, transfer or novation of each New Finco Loan, subject to
minimum transfer amount of $200,000 principal amount (in the case of Finco Loan $) and £100,000 principal
amount (in the case of Finco Loan £), as applicable, and other requirements of a VM Credit Facility Lender under
the VM Credit Facility.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, in
case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of
the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee indemnity or security
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts (if any) when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 50% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee and/or the Security Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder has offered the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory
to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt
of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
and/or the Security Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as
applicable, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will
provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use under the circumstances in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with Law, the
Indenture, the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of Notes or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or
indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not
taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee,
the Trustee must give notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the
payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes.

267


-----

With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists”, “is continuing” or similar expressions
with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or
waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a
specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the
applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the
terms of the Indenture or any Transaction Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be
cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken
under the Indenture and the Transaction Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or
otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture
and the Transaction Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured
**Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any**
action by any person, which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default
not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured
Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial
**Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph:**

(a) in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of the second sentence of this paragraph, if an Officer
of the Issuer had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and
was continuing; or

(b) if the Trustee shall have declared all the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to the provisions
described under “Events of Default” prior to the date such Initial Default would have been deemed to be
cured under this paragraph.

For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Issuer,
(i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such
individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of diligence and care as
would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a
failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without
any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Information”, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to
any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by
such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding any provision in the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement or otherwise to the contrary, the obligations of the Issuer to the Trustee, the Security Trustee,
any Registrar, any Paying Agent and the holders of the Notes under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes
Security Documents shall be limited to the proceeds of the realization of the Collateral once the proceeds have
been applied in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement. Having realized all the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Notes, the
Notes Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement and distributed the net proceeds thereof in
accordance with the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement, none of the Trustee, the Security Trustee,
any Registrar, any Paying Agent and the holders of the Notes may take any further steps to recover any sum still
unpaid in respect of the Notes, the Indenture or any of the Notes Security Documents or otherwise and all claims
against the Issuer in respect of any such sum due but still unpaid shall be extinguished.

**Non-Petition**

Each of the Trustee, the Security Trustee, any Registrar, any Paying Agent and each holder of Notes will
agree that its rights against the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the
Collateral Sharing Agreement will be limited to the extent that it will not take any action or proceedings against
the Issuer to recover any amounts due and payable by the Issuer to it thereunder except as expressly permitted by
the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the Collateral Sharing Agreement.
Each of the Trustee, the Security Trustee, any Registrar, any Paying Agent and each holder of Notes will further
agree that it will not, and in the case of a holder of Notes will not request that the Trustee or the Security Trustee
on its behalf, petition a court for, or take any other action or commence any proceedings for, the liquidation or
winding-up of the Issuer or any other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer.

268


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or stockholder of the Issuer, any of their respective
parent companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of a Note, by accepting a Note,
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the United States federal securities
Laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

**_To the VM Credit Facility or the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements_**

In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise
consent) (including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter, other than the VM
Credit Facility Amendments, arising from time to time under the VM Credit Facility or under any New Finco
Facility Accession Agreement in which all VM Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required to
vote (or otherwise consent) (a “VM Credit Facility Decision”), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other consents)
from the holders of the Notes (each, a “Noteholder Consent”) with respect to such VM Credit Facility Decision
in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described above under “—Certain Covenants—Minimum
_Period for Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents”. Upon the expiration of the applicable consent_
period, the Issuer will inform the VM Credit Facility Agent promptly in writing (and in no event more than one
Business Day following such expiration) of the results of the Noteholder Consent.

Under the terms of the VM Credit Facility, VM Credit Facility Lenders are not entitled to split their votes
when voting on a proposed consent, waiver, amendment or other determination. The following voting mechanic
is designed to achieve the same practical effect as allowing a VM Credit Facility Lender to split its vote (subject
to the provisions set forth below) under the VM Credit Facility.

Under the terms of each Finco Facility Accession Agreement, the VM Credit Facility Agent will be
authorized to apply the Noteholder Consent to the VM Credit Facility Decision, at the direction of the Issuer or
Trustee, as follows:

(OLC+BC+ABC+OBC)
= Threshold Amount
OL

Where:

“OLC” = aggregate Commitments consenting (other than any Commitments of the Issuer and any other
SPV Issuer) to such VM Credit Facility Decision;

“BC” = aggregate principal amount of Notes consenting; provided that where at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Notes that respond to such solicitation provide consent, BC will be deemed to
equal the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that with respect to any
VM Credit Facility Decision on any VM Credit Facility Amendments, BC will be deemed to equal the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that for purposes of the calculation of BC, the
principal amount of the Dollar Notes will be converted into sterling at the Facility Agent’s Spot Rate of
Exchange (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) as of the Issue Date;

“ABC” = aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes consenting; provided that where at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes that respond to such
solicitation provide consent, ABC will be deemed equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s Other
SPV Notes then outstanding; provided, further, that where two or more series of the Issuer’s Other SPV Notes
vote as a single class under an indenture, they will constitute a single series for purposes of this definition;

“OBC” = aggregate principal amount of SPV Notes issued by all SPV Issuers (other than any SPV Notes
issued by the Issuer) consenting; provided that, with respect to each SPV Issuer (other than the Issuer), where at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of SPV Notes issued by such SPV Issuer that respond to such
solicitation provide consent, OBC with respect to such SPV Issuer will be deemed to equal the aggregate

269


-----

principal amount of the SPV Notes then outstanding and issued by such SPV Issuer; provided, further, that where
two or more series of such SPV Issuer’s SPV Notes vote as a single class under an indenture, they will constitute
a single series for purposes of this definition;

“OL” = aggregate Commitments under the VM Credit Facility; and

“Commitments” means the aggregate undrawn Commitments (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) and
participations in outstanding Advances (as defined in the VM Credit Facility) under the VM Credit Facility;
_provided that, solely for the purposes of determining whether any amendment or waiver of any term of the VM_
Credit Facility has been approved by the relevant VM Credit Facility Lenders, the amount of the Advances and
undrawn Commitments shall be reduced by the amount of the Advances and undrawn Commitments of any VM
Credit Facility Lender that has not responded to such request for amendment or waiver within 10 Business Days
after the date such request has been received by it (or within such other period as the VM Credit Facility Agent
and VMIH shall specify).

In connection with any vote or consent, the Issuer will, on or prior to the day that is 10 Business Days after
the date such request has been notified to the relevant VM Credit Facility Lenders by the VM Credit Facility
Agent, instruct the VM Credit Facility Agent to vote or consent in accordance with the voting mechanic
described above, request further information from the VM Credit Facility Agent or notify the VM Credit Facility
Agent that it is actively reviewing such request with a view to making such decision.

To the extent the Threshold Amount (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to the required
percentage of VM Credit Facility Lender consents with respect to any VM Credit Facility Decision, the entire
amount of each New Finco Loan will be voted in favor of the matter that is the subject of such VM Credit
Facility Decision. To the extent the Threshold Amount is less than the required percentage of VM Credit Facility
Lender consents with respect to any VM Credit Facility Decision, the entire amount of each New Finco Loan will
be voted against the matter that is the subject of such VM Credit Facility Decision.

Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph, any provision or term of the New Finco Facility
Accession Agreements and the VM Credit Facility applicable only to the New Finco Loans or to a several right
of the Issuer, as VM Credit Facility Lender, may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of
at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any
existing Default or Event of Default in respect of, or compliance with, any such provision or term may be waived
with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes); provided that any provision or term of a New Finco Facility Accession Agreement or the VM
Credit Facility applicable only to Finco Loan $ or Finco Loan £ may be amended or supplemented with the
consent of holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes or the Sterling Notes
(and not the consent of at least a majority in the principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may
be.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Dollar Notes (in respect of the Finco Facility $ Accession Agreement) or Sterling Notes (in respect of the Finco
Facility £ Accession Agreement) (in each case, including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the relevant series of Notes), an amendment,
supplement or waiver of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements may not (with respect to any Notes held
by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest under the applicable New Finco
Loan;

(2) reduce any amounts payable in respect of any prepayment of the applicable New Finco Loan;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of the applicable New Finco Loan;

(4) make the applicable New Finco Loan payable in a currency other than that stated in the applicable New
Finco Facility Accession Agreement (except to the extent the currency stated in the applicable New Finco
Facility Accession Agreement has been succeeded or replaced pursuant to applicable Law); or

(5) modify the payment terms of the applicable New Finco Facility Accession Agreement.

**_To the Indenture and the Notes_**

Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security
Document, the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional
Collateral Sharing Agreement, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters and the Expenses Agreement may be amended
or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant,
the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, the New Finco Facility Fee
Letters and the Expenses Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that if any amendment, waiver or other
modification will only affect the Dollar Notes or the Sterling Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable (and
not the consent of at least a majority of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes) (provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect the
Dollar Notes or the Sterling Notes, the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable (and not the consent of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required), an amendment, supplement or
waiver of the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the
Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters
and the Expenses Agreement may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

determination;

has arisen;

(5) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Note (except to the extent that the
currency stated in the Notes has been succeeded or replaced pursuant to applicable Law);

(6) impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of, premium, if any, principal of or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for
the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s Notes; or

(7) make any change in these amendment or waiver provisions.

In addition, without the consent of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
(provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect the Dollar Notes or the Sterling
Notes, the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Dollar
Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable (and not the consent of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of
all Notes then outstanding), shall be required), no amendment or supplement may modify any Notes Security
Document or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with the Notes Security Documents or application of trust
moneys in any manner, taken as a whole, materially adverse to the holders of the Notes or otherwise release all or
substantially all of the Collateral except in accordance with the terms of the Notes Security Documents, the
Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement or as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the New

271


-----

Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing
Agreement, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters and the Expenses Agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, manifest error, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended));

(3) to add guarantees with respect to, or secure, the Notes (including, without limitation, to grant any security or
supplemental security);

(4) to add to the covenants of the Issuer or any other Person or surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Security Documents;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the Notes or that
does not adversely affect the rights of any such holder in any material respect;

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Notes Security
Document or any other Transaction Document to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the
extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, any Notes Security Document or
any other Transaction Document;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to the extent necessary to allow the Issuer to participate on the same terms as other VM Credit Facility
Lenders in an offer to purchase or otherwise acquire VM Credit Facility Loans by any member of the Bank
Group made in compliance with the requirements set out under “—Open Market Purchases of VM Credit
_Facility Loans”;_

(9) to give effect to Permitted Issuer Liens;

(10) to release any Lien on the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes Security
Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement;

(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture, the Notes Security
Documents, the Collateral Sharing Agreement and/or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement of a
successor Trustee or Security Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes; provided that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being
transferred in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable securities Law and (ii) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the relevant series of Notes; provided that such
reduction would not result in a breach of applicable securities Laws or in a requirement to produce a
prospectus or otherwise register the Notes with any regulatory authority in connection with any investment
therein or resale thereof;

(14) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary; or

(15) to the extent reasonably necessary to give effect to the Transactions.

For purposes of determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have taken any
action under the Indenture (other than with respect to a determination that only affects the Dollar Notes), the
principal amount of Dollar Notes shall be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of such principal amount of such
Dollar Notes as of (a) if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action, such date or (b) if no
such record date has been set, the date the taking of such action by the holders of such requisite principal amount
is certified to the Trustee by the Issuer.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence
as it deems appropriate, including an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

272


-----

A consent to any amendment or waiver by any holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such holder’s
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the
guidelines of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such amendment, supplement
and waiver.

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer or payment of a consent fee to holders of the
Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, the Notes Security Documents, the New Finco Facility Deed of Covenant, the Collateral
Sharing Agreement, any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters and the
Expenses Agreement will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, or
as to the Dollar Notes or the Sterling Notes, as applicable, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes (or all Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable) that have been authenticated, except lost,
stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee, Paying
Agent or Registrar, as applicable, for cancellation; or

(b) (i) all Notes (or all Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable) that have not been delivered to the
Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation (A) have become due and payable by reason of the
mailing or delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise or (B) will become due and payable within
one year and (ii) the Issuer or a third party acting on behalf of the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders with
respect to the Dollar Notes, cash, Cash Equivalents, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in each case, denominated in U.S. dollars, and with respect to the Sterling Notes, cash, Cash
Equivalents, U.K. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in
sterling, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay
and discharge the entire Financial Indebtedness on the Notes (or the Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as
applicable) not delivered to the Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation for principal,
premium and Additional Amounts (if any) and accrued interest to, but excluding, the date of maturity
or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or a third party acting on behalf of the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other amounts
payable by it under the Indenture with respect to the Notes (or all Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as
applicable); and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes (or all Dollar Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable) at maturity or
on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in
each case, stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

In addition, if:

(1) part of the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Called Notes”) and/or the Sterling Notes (the “Sterling Called
**Notes”, together with the Dollar Called Notes, the “Called Notes”) have become irrevocably due and**
payable by reason of the mailing or delivery of an unconditional notice of redemption or otherwise;

(2) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely
for the benefit of the holders of such Called Notes, with respect to the Dollar Called Notes, cash, Cash
Equivalents, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in U.S.
dollars, and with respect to the Sterling Called Notes, cash, Cash Equivalents, U.K. Government Obligations
or a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in sterling, in amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Financial Indebtedness on such
Called Notes for principal, premium and Additional Amounts (if any) and accrued interest to, but excluding,
the date of redemption; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of such Called Notes on the redemption date,

273


-----

then such Called Notes will not constitute Financial Indebtedness under the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer
must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that all
conditions precedent to such Called Notes not constituting Financial Indebtedness have been satisfied.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture with
respect to the Sterling Notes is sterling and with respect to the Dollar Notes is U.S. dollars. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than sterling, in respect of the Sterling Notes or U.S. dollars, in respect of the
Dollar Notes, as the case may be (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of
any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) by the Trustee, the Security Trustee
or the holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will constitute a
discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the sterling or U.S. dollar amount, as the case may be, which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
possible to do so). If that sterling or U.S. dollar amount, as the case may be, is less than the sterling or U.S. dollar
amount, as the case may be, expressed to be due to the recipient under the Indenture or any Note, the Issuer will
indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Issuer will indemnify the
recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for such recipient to certify that it would have
suffered a loss had an actual purchase of sterling or U.S. dollars, as the case may be, been made with the amount
so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of sterling or U.S. dollars,
as the case may be, on such date had not been practicable, on the first date on which it would have been
practicable). These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the
Issuer, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted
by any holder and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Listing**

The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and
will maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer can no longer maintain
such listing or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt,
preparation of financial statements in accordance with any accounting standard other than the standard pursuant
to which the Issuer then prepares its financial statements shall be deemed unduly burdensome), the Issuer may
cease to make or maintain such listing on the Exchange; provided, further, that the Issuer will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized listing exchange for high yield
issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union or the U.K.). There can be
no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Notes
is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease
to make or maintain a listing (whether on the Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield
issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest
payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions. However, if it acquires any conflicting
interest, as such term is used in the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, it must eliminate such conflict
within 90 days or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in
the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security
and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. It may not be possible for the Trustee to
take certain actions in relation to the Notes and accordingly in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to
take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or an indemnity to it.

274


-----

**Notices**

So long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange, any notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be
published to the extent and as required by the rules of the Exchange. In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Additionally, in the event the Notes are in the form of
Definitive Registered Notes, notices will be sent, by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each holder of
the Notes at such holder’s address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar. If publication as
provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such other manner, and shall be deemed to have been
given on such date, as the Trustee may approve. If and so long as such Notes are listed on any other securities
exchange, notices will also be given in accordance with any applicable requirements of such securities exchange.
Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices
given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes will each be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York. The VM Credit Facility, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements, the New Finco
Facility Deed of Covenant, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Expenses Agreement, the New Finco Facility
Fee Letters and certain Notes Security Documents will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
English law.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will irrevocably appoint Virgin Media, as its agent for service of
process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture and the Notes, as the case may be, brought
in any federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and that each of the
parties submit to the jurisdiction thereof. If, for any reason Virgin Media is unable to serve in such capacity, the
Issuer shall appoint another agent.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the assets of the Issuer are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States
against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment
of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

**General**

The Dollar Notes offered hereby are denominated in U.S. dollars and the Sterling Notes offered hereby are
denominated in pound sterling.

The Dollar Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by
temporary notes in registered, global form, without interest coupons (the “Dollar Regulation S Temporary
**Global Notes”). The Sterling Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be**
represented by temporary notes in registered, global form, without interest coupons (the “Sterling Regulation S
**Temporary Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the**
“Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”). The Dollar Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited
upon issuance with a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The
Sterling Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this
offering (such period the “distribution compliance period” as defined in Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction
**Period”)), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear**
and Clearstream (including as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery
through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described under
“—Transfers” below. After the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period, the Dollar Regulation S Temporary
Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes in registered, global form without interest
coupons (the “Dollar Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes, the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”), the Sterling Regulation S Temporary
Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes in registered, global form without interest
coupons (the “Sterling Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Sterling Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes, the “Sterling Regulation S Global Notes”). The term “Regulation S Permanent
**Global Notes” as used herein shall refer to, collectively, the Dollar Regulation S Permanent Global Notes and**
the Sterling Regulation S Permanent Global Notes. The term “Regulation S Global Notes” as used herein shall
refer to either the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes or Regulation S Permanent Global Notes, as the context
requires.

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers pursuant to
Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form, without interest coupons
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar 144A Global Notes” and, together with the
Dollar Regulation S Global Notes, the “Dollar Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a custodian
for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Rule 144A Global Notes
representing the Sterling Notes (the “Sterling 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Sterling Regulation S
Global Notes, the “Sterling Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The book-entry interests in the Global Notes will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the U.S., may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge bookentry interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, “holders” of book-entry interests will not be
considered the owners of Notes for any purpose. Only the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner
of such Note. So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees) will be considered the holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As
such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own
book-entry interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A book-entry interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S book-entry interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A book-entry interests, the “book-entry interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-entry

285


-----

interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry
form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The book-entry interests in the Dollar Global
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal amount and in integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof and the book-entry interests in the Sterling Global Notes will be issued only in
minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Neither we nor the Trustee under the Indenture nor any of our respective agents will have any responsibility
or be liable for any aspect of the records in relation to the book-entry interests.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders
of the book-entry interests in such Global Note, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such book-entry interests will be equal to the amount
received by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof), subject to any applicable withholding taxes. We understand that under existing practices of
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments
to prevent fractions) or by lot or on any other basis that they deem fair and appropriate; provided that no bookentry interest of less than $200,000 in principal amount in the case of the Dollar Global Notes or £100,000 in
principal amount in the case of the Sterling Global Notes may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by us to a paying agent. The paying agent will, in
turn, make such payments to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee (in the case of the Sterling Global Notes) and DTC or
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (i.e., DTC or the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the
Trustee or any of our respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a book-entry interest, for any such payments made by
DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to a book-entry interest or payments made on account of a book-entry interest; or

    - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of book-entry interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street
name”.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of (i) the Dollar
Global Notes will be paid in U.S. dollars through DTC and (ii) the Sterling Global Notes will be paid in pound
sterling through Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not

286


-----

exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve
their right, subject to certain restrictions, to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined herein) in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective
participants.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Owners of book-entry interests will receive definitive notes in registered form (“Definitive Registered
**Notes”):**

    - if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear and/or Clearstream (with respect to the
Sterling Global Notes) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act and a successor is not
appointed by us within 120 days;

    - in whole, but not in part, if the Issuer, DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear and/
or Clearstream (with respect to the Sterling Global Notes) so request following an Event of Default
under (and as defined in) the Indenture; or

    - if the owner of a book-entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream or the Issuer following an Event of Default under (and as defined in) the
Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a book-entry interest described in the
immediately preceding clause, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued
Definitive Registered Notes to all owners of book-entry interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of book-entry interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the paying agents and the registrar shall treat the registered holder of any Definitive
Registered Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as
such. Ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time in
the register maintained by the Registrar on behalf of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the Notes.

The Issuer shall not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the bookentry interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture and will not be entitled to Definitive Registered Notes except as provided in
“ —Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes”.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-entry interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions”.

During the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same
currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a

287


-----

certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is both a QIB and a Qualified Purchaser in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other_
jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt
by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, book-entry interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”.

Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a
book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note,
and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a book-entry interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Definitive Registered
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

This paragraph refers to transfers and exchanges with respect to Dollar Global Notes only. Transfers
involving an exchange of a Regulation S book-entry interest for Rule 144A book-entry interest in a Dollar Global
Note will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the registrar through the DTC Deposit/
Withdrawal at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will
be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding Rule 144A Global Note. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of unrestricted book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note
prior to the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period. Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in any other Global Note will,
upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry
interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a
book-entry interest.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All book-entry interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each Clearing System are controlled by that Clearing
System and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

DTC has advised us that it is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law;

    - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

288


-----

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants
include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks,
brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes
only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Notes will be made in U.S. dollars. Initial settlement for the Sterling Notes
will be made in pound sterling. Book-entry interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will
follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-entry interests will
be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading, Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Issuer will make an application to have the Notes admitted to listing on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange, and interests in the Dollar Global Notes will trade in DTC’s Same Day Funds
Settlement System, and we expect any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore,
be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer
restrictions applicable to the Dollar Global Notes and the Sterling Global Notes, cross market transfers of
interests in the Dollar Global Notes and the Sterling Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures. Cross-market transfers with respect to interests in Dollar Global Notes between participants in DTC,
on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in
accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by the common depositary; however,
such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the
counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of
such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements,
deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering
or receiving interests in the Global Notes from DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with
normal procedures for same day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream
participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary.

Because of time-zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC.

289


-----

Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of
DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

The book-entry interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition,
ownership, and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussion under
“—FATCA” and “—U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting”. This description only applies to
Notes held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth
below, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax
rules, such as:

    - banks or other financial institutions;

    - insurance companies;

    - real estate investment trusts, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts;

    - regulated investment companies;

    - grantor trusts;

    - tax-exempt organizations;

    - persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities;

    - dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

    - U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

    - certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States;

    - U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or

    - U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion
or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Moreover, this description does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or alternative minimum tax
consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes and does not address the 3.8% Medicare
tax on net investment income that may also apply to certain U.S. Holders’ capital gains and interest in respect of
the Notes or rules requiring persons that use the accrual method of accounting to include certain amounts in
income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. This description does
not address U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as part of the initial
distribution at their initial issue price (generally, the first price to the public at which a substantial amount of the
Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S.
federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes.

This description is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury
**Regulations”), administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date**
hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) or differing interpretations,
which could affect the tax considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel or ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No
assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from
any of the tax considerations discussed below.

For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal
income tax purposes is:

    - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust (1) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
(2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the
substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control.

291


-----

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to
its consequences.

Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of Notes should consult their own tax advisors
concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to their particular situations as well as any
considerations arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**Treatment of the Notes as Debt**

The Issuer expects and, to the extent required, intends to take the position that the Notes should be treated as
debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; however no assurances can be given that the Issuer’s
position will not be successfully challenged by the IRS. In such case, U.S. Holders would be treated as holding
equity in the Issuer. If the Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.
Holders would likely be subject to adverse tax consequences, including those under the passive foreign
investment company rules pursuant to which (i) all or a portion of any gain on disposition of the Notes would be
treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain, (ii) a deferred interest charge would apply to such gain and on
certain distributions on the Notes and (iii) a U.S. Holder would be required to comply with certain reporting
requirements.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their
particular situations. The discussion below assumes that the Notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

**Redemptions and Additional Amounts**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may be obligated
to make payments in excess of stated interest and the principal amount of the Notes (“Additional Amounts”) or
redeem the Notes in advance of their expected maturity at a premium (see “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”). The Issuer believes, and intends to take the_
position if required, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments in light of,
among other things, the possibility of such payments or redemptions. This position is based in part on
assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, of such payments or redemptions.
Assuming such position is respected, any payments of Additional Amounts should be taxable as additional
ordinary income when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and any premium paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any repurchase or redemption
would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition by a U.S.
_Holder”. The IRS may, however, take a position contrary to the position described above, which could affect the_
amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes. A U.S. Holder that desires to
take the position that the Notes are subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules should consult with
its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such position as required by applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules
and the consequences thereof. This discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest**

Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as a “qualified stated interest”. Payments of
qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any Additional Amounts and without reduction for any taxes
withheld) generally will be includable in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the
time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or other property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as
constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate.

In the case of the Sterling Notes, stated interest paid in pound sterling (including the amount of any
withholding tax thereon) will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar
value of the pound sterling, regardless of whether the pound sterling is converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a

292


-----

U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate
of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or
loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the pound sterling received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax
accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest income using the average rate of exchange for
the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the
partial period within each taxable year).

Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued
interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of
the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the
accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an
interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in
translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S.
Holder will be an amount equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar value of the pound sterling interest
payment (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the
accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as
determined above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or
loss will be ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or
expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source provided that the residence of a taxpayer is
considered to be the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss.

Interest, including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with
respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation
on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific
“baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”. Any
non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax
credits.

**Original Issue Discount**

A Note will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the stated principal
amount of the Note exceeds its issue price by 1/4 of 1% of the Note’s stated principal amount multiplied by the
number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity.

If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the
receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The
amount of OID a U.S. Holder should include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note
for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the Note is held by such U.S.
Holder. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual
period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the
Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or
interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of
OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price”
of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant
yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular
accrual period) and (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted
issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the
amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the Note that were not
qualified stated interest.

Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of
OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount
payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the
beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to
include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with

293


-----

respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an
election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor.

U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and
yield to maturity by contacting the Directors, Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London, W6 8BS, United
Kingdom.

Any OID on a Sterling Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in pound sterling and then
translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon
receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such Sterling Note
or otherwise), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in
the same manner as stated interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are
urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign
currency exchange gain or loss rules.

The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding
the application of these rules to their particular situations.

**Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition by a U.S. Holder**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition (other than any amount received in respect of accrued and unpaid stated
interest which will be subject to tax in the manner described above in “—Payments and Accruals of Stated
_Interest” to the extent not previously included in income), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note._

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of
any OID previously included in income. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Sterling Note with pound sterling, the U.S.
dollar cost of the Sterling Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of
purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a
Sterling Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount received on the date of the disposition
calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the Sterling Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine
the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Sterling Note by translating the amount paid or
received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as applicable. The
election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the purchase and disposition of Sterling Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder
generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary
income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Sterling Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is
attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such
Sterling Note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the
U.S. Holder’s pound sterling purchase price for the Sterling Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
Holder’s pound sterling purchase price for the Sterling Note. The realization of any foreign currency gain or loss,
including foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest
and any OID, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Sterling Note.

**Exchange of Amounts in Other than U.S. Dollars**

If a U.S. Holder receives pound sterling as interest on a Sterling Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Sterling Note, such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the pound sterling will equal the U.S.
dollar value when the pound sterling are received. If a U.S. Holder purchased a Sterling Note with previously

294


-----

owned non-U.S. currency, gain or loss on such currency will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference,
if any, between the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such currency and the spot rate on the date of purchase of the
Sterling Note. Any such gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss from sources within the
United States provided that the residence of the U.S. Holder is considered to be the United States for purposes of
the rule governing foreign currency transactions.

**Reportable Transaction Reporting**

Under certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, U.S. Holders that participate in “reportable transactions” (as
defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) must attach to their U.S. federal income tax returns a disclosure
statement on IRS Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency
exchange loss from the Sterling Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the
U.S. Treasury Regulations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to file
IRS Form 8886 with respect to the ownership or disposition of the Sterling Notes, or any related transaction,
including without limitation, the disposition of any non-U.S. currency received as interest or as proceeds from
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Sterling Notes.

**Additional Notes**

The Issuer may issue “Additional Notes” (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”). In some cases, these
Additional Notes may not be fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even if they
are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as either series of original Notes, which may affect the
market value of the original Notes even if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the

**U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting**

Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments of principal of,
and interest and accruals of OID, if any, on, an obligation and to proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of an obligation, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor will be required to withhold backup
withholding tax on payments made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman or certain of
their affiliates, on a Note to, or from gross proceeds of the sale or disposition of a Note paid to, a U.S. Holder if
the U.S. Holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or
establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any
required information in a timely manner.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes as “specified
foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held
in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder
(commonly referred to as “FATCA”) generally imposes withholding at a rate of 30% on payments of interest
made to any foreign entity on debt obligations generating U.S. source interest or certain other debt obligations
generating non-U.S. source interest including “foreign passthru payments” made by a foreign financial
institution, unless the foreign financial institution complies with certain reporting rules under FATCA or
otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Currently, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not defined and it is
unclear whether or to what extent payments on the Notes would be considered foreign passthru payments,
assuming the issuer would be considered a foreign financial institution. If and when such regulations are issued,
the Notes will be grandfathered and FATCA withholding should not apply to the Notes to the extent otherwise
applicable. If, however, the Notes are modified more than six months after the date final regulations defining a
foreign passthru payment are published FATCA withholding may apply (effective beginning two years from
such date of publication), and holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any
Additional Amounts to compensate them for any such withholding. In addition, if Additional Notes are issued

-----

after the expiration of the grandfathering period and have the same international securities identification number
(the “ISIN”), common code and/or CUSIP as the Notes issued hereby, then withholding agents may treat all
notes bearing the same ISIN, common code and/or CUSIP number, including any Notes issued hereby, as subject
to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a refund in
such circumstances. The intergovernmental agreement between the U.K. and the United States modifies the
requirements in this paragraph and an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign
country where a holder or intermediary is located may further modify such requirements. Prospective holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the
Notes.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating**
**to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should**
**consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**CERTAIN MATERIAL UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general guide to certain U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes based on current
U.K. law and published practice of HM Revenue & Customs (which may not be binding on HM Revenue &
Customs), both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes. In particular, it does not address the U.K.
tax consequences of the sale, exchange, redemption, or other disposal of the Notes. Prospective investors should
consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible U.K. or other tax consequences of buying,
holding or selling any Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile,
including the effect of any state or local tax laws. It applies only to persons who are the absolute beneficial
owners of Notes and some aspects do not apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities.
Prospective investors who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the U.K. or who are in any doubt as
to their tax position should consult their own professional advisors.

**Payment of Interest**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of section 987 of the Income Tax Act
2007 (the “2007 Act”), as long as they are and continue to be listed on a “recognized stock exchange” within the
meaning of section 1005 of the 2007 Act. The International Stock Exchange is such a “recognized stock
exchange”. The Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed on The International Stock
Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in the EEA and the U.K.
Provided that this condition remains satisfied, payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction
or withholding for or on account of U.K. tax.

In the event that the Notes are not or cease to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, payments of interest
must be made under deduction of income tax at the basic rate, currently 20%, subject to any direction to the
contrary by HM Revenue & Customs under an applicable double taxation treaty, unless payments are made to
some categories of recipients, including companies which the Issuer reasonably believes are subject to U.K.
corporation tax in respect of the payment of interest.

Interest on the Notes may be subject to income tax by direct assessment even where paid without deduction
or withholding for or on account of U.K. income tax. Interest on the Notes received without deduction or
withholding for or on account of U.K. tax will not generally be chargeable to U.K. tax in the hands of a holder of
Notes who is not resident for tax purposes in the U.K. (other than in the case of certain trustees) unless that
holder of Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a U.K. branch or agency, or for
holders of Notes who are companies through a U.K. permanent establishment, in connection with which the
interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable. There are exemptions from U.K. tax for interest
received through certain categories of agent, such as some brokers and investment managers. The provisions of
an applicable double tax treaty may be relevant to such a holder of Notes.

The provisions relating to additional payments referred to under “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes” would not apply if HM Revenue & Customs sought to assess the person entitled to the interest directly to_
U.K. income tax. Exemption from or reduction of U.K. tax liability might be available under an applicable
double taxation treaty.

**Provision of Information**

Holders of Notes should note that where any interest on Notes is paid to them (or to any person acting on
their behalf) by the Issuer or any person in the U.K. acting on behalf of that Issuer (a “paying agent”), or is
received by any person in the U.K. acting on behalf of the relevant holder (save where such person is engaged
solely in a passive role in the payment process, for example clearing or arranging the clearing of a check) (a
“collecting agent”), then the Issuer, the paying agent or the collecting agent (as the case may be) may, in certain
cases, be required to supply to HM Revenue & Customs details of the payment and certain details relating to the
holder (including the holder’s name and address). These provisions will apply whether or not the interest has
been paid subject to deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K. income tax and whether or not the holder
is resident in the U.K. for U.K. taxation purposes. Where the holder is not so resident, the details provided to HM
Revenue & Customs may, in certain cases, be passed by HM Revenue & Customs to the tax authorities of the
jurisdiction in which the holder is resident for taxation purposes.

297


-----

For the above purposes, “interest” should be taken, for practical purposes, as including payments made by a
guarantor in respect of interest on the Notes.

The provisions referred to above may also apply to payments made on redemption of any Notes where the
amount payable on redemption is greater than the issue price of the Notes.

**European Information Exchange Regimes**

On December 9, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Directive (EC Council Directive
2014/107/EU amending EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU) to implement the OECD measures known as the
“Common Reporting Standard”. Member States and the U.K. were required to begin exchanging information
pursuant to such Directive no later than September 30, 2017 (although this date was extended to September 30,
2018 for Austria). The Common Reporting Standard is generally broader than the (now repealed) European
Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), although
it does not impose withholding taxes.

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)**

No U.K. stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Notes or on a transfer of the Notes.

**CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain
fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment
funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities
whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those
persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority
or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is
generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject
to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification
and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain
persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under Section 3(14) of ERISA or “disqualified persons” under
Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction
may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have
to be rescinded.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise
if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the
Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Even if none of the
Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction
may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing
parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part
on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such
decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”)
91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to
transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance
company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset
managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be
available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a person that is a party in
interest solely by reason of being a service provider to a Plan investing in the Notes for adequate consideration or
an affiliate of such service provider, provided such service provider or affiliate is not a fiduciary with respect to
the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such fiduciary (the “Service Provider Exemption”).
“Adequate consideration” means fair market as determined in good faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to
regulations to be promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there can be no assurance that any of
these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory
exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

“Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions
of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local,
non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the
Code (“Similar Laws”).

The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited
transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be
available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of
an applicable exemption.

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN (1) EITHER
(A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS THIS NOTE
OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF OF) (I) AN
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE
PROVISIONS OF PART 4 OF SUBTITLE B OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT
ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE APPLIES,

MEANING OF 29 C.F.R. SECTION 2510.3-101, AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 3(42) OF ERISA) BY
REASON OF ANY SUCH PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN SUCH ENTITY (EACH OF (I), (II) AND (III), A
“BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR”) OR (IV) A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN WHICH
IS SUBJECT TO ANY SIMILAR LAWS, AND NO PART OF THE ASSETS TO BE USED BY IT TO
ACQUIRE OR HOLD SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN CONSTITUTES THE ASSETS OF ANY
BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR ANY SUCH GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, OR
(B) ITS ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN
DOES NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT
PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA AND/OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE
(OR, IN THE CASE OF A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH, OR NON-U.S. PLAN, A NON-EXEMPT
VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS); AND (2) NONE OF THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,
THE TRUSTEE, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES IS A “FIDUCIARY” (WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR, WITH RESPECT TO A
GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, ANY DEFINITION OF “FIDUCIARY” UNDER
SIMILAR LAWS) WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRER OR TRANSFEREE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
PURCHASE OR HOLDING OF THE NOTE, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY EXERCISE BY THE ISSUER, THE
INITIAL PURCHASERS, THE TRUSTEE OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OF ANY
RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE, AND NO ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER, THE
INITIAL PURCHASERS, THE TRUSTEE OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES CONSTITUTES
“INVESTMENT ADVICE” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975
OF THE CODE) IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTE.

THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THE TRUSTEE, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES, SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONCLUSIVELY RELY UPON THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY
OF THE FOREGOING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY ACQUIRERS AND
TRANSFEREES OF ANY NOTES WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY.

The transfer of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is
subject to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or
any of their respective affiliates, that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by such plans generally or any particular such plan; that the Investor-Based Exemptions or the
Service Provider Exemption described above, or any other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such
an investment by such plans in general or any particular such plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for
such plans generally or any particular such plan.

The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this offering memorandum, is, of
necessity, general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore,
the matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which
may have retroactive application and effect.

Any Plan or employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and any fiduciary
thereof, proposing to participate in the offers and acquire the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its
legal advisors regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable
requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as such terms are defined under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant
to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered by this offering memorandum only (a) to
QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons
as defined in Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act in an offshore transaction in reliance upon Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes (a “purchaser”), by its acceptance of this offering memorandum, will be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, the Notes are being offered for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities
laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S, and none of the Notes may be offered,
sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption from such laws or in a
transaction not subject to such laws, and in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
forth in paragraph (5) below.

(2) The purchaser acknowledges that this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC rules
that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of securities. The purchaser will,
and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser from it of those Notes of
the resale restrictions referred to herein.

(3) The purchaser is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of ours, the purchaser is not acting on our
behalf and is either:

(a) a QIB and a Qualified Purchaser, and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in
reliance on Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of
another QIB that is also a Qualified Purchaser; or

(b) not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing the Notes for the account or benefit of a U.S. person)
within the meaning of Regulation S, and is purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

Furthermore, unless the purchaser is not a U.S. person purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S as set forth in clause (b) of this paragraph (3), the purchaser
acknowledges that it will hold and transfer at least the minimum denomination of the Dollar Notes and
that: (i) it is not a broker-dealer who owns and invests on a discretionary basis less than $25,000,000 in
securities of unaffiliated issuers; (ii) it is not a participant-directed employee plan, such as a 401(k)
plan, or a trust holding the assets of such a plan; (iii) it was not formed, reformed or recapitalized for
the specific purpose of investing in the Notes and/or other securities of the Issuer, unless all of the
beneficial owners of its securities are both QIBs and Qualified Purchasers; (iv) if it is an investment
company excepted from the U.S. Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or
Section 3(c)(7) thereof and was formed on or before April 30, 1996, it has received the consent of its
beneficial owners who acquired their interests on or before April 30, 1996, with respect to its treatment
as a Qualified Purchaser in the manner required by Section 2(a)(51)(C) of the U.S. Investment
Company Act and the rules promulgated thereunder; (v) it is not a partnership, common trust fund, or
corporation, special trust, pension fund or retirement plan, or other entity, in which the partners,
beneficiaries, beneficial owners, participants, shareholders or other equity owners, as the case may be,
may designate the particular investment to be made, or the allocation thereof, unless all such partners,
beneficiaries, beneficial owners, participants, shareholders or other equity owners are both QIBs and
Qualified Purchasers; and (vi) it has not invested more than 40% of its assets in the Notes (or beneficial
interests therein) and/or other securities of the Issuer after giving effect to the purchase of the Notes (or
beneficial interests therein), unless all of the beneficial owners of its securities are both QIBs and
Qualified Purchasers.

(4) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers or any person representing the
Issue or the Initial Purchasers have not made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer or the
offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which
offering memorandum has been delivered to it. Accordingly, it acknowledges that no representation or
warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. The
purchaser has had access to such financial and other information as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of
and request information from the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, and it has received and reviewed all
information that it requested.

(5) The purchaser is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the U.S. Securities Act,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be, at all times, within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any exemption from registration available under
the U.S. Securities Act. The purchaser agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account
for which it is purchasing the Notes and each subsequent holder of the Notes, by its acceptance of the
Notes, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the end of the resale restriction periods
described below only (a) to us or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which
has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144A to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that is also a Qualified
Purchaser that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB that is also a Qualified
Purchaser, to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A,
(d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the
meaning of Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of
law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws. The
purchaser will, and each subsequent purchaser is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the
Notes from the purchaser or it of the resale restrictions referred to in the legend below. The foregoing
restrictions on resale will apply from the closing date until the applicable Resale Restriction
Termination Date (as defined below) and will not apply thereafter. Each purchaser acknowledges that
we and the Trustee under the Indenture reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer
pursuant to clauses (d) or (e) prior to the applicable Resale Restriction Termination Date to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the
Trustee.

(6) The purchaser understands that if it is a non-U.S. person outside of the United States, the Notes will be
represented by a Regulation S Global Note and that transfers of such notes are restricted as described in
this section and in the section entitled “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance” or if it is a QIB that is
also a Qualified Purchaser, the Notes it purchases will be represented by a Rule 144A Global Note.
Such purchaser also confirms that it is not a retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the U.K. has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA or the U.K. may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each certificate representing a note will contain a legend substantially to
the following effect:

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THIS NOTE WAS ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (“OID”) WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 1273 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE
“CODE”), AND THIS LEGEND IS REQUIRED BY SECTION 1275(c) OF THE CODE.

HOLDERS MAY OBTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF ANY OID, THE ISSUE
PRICE, THE ISSUE DATE AND THE YIELD TO MATURITY RELATING TO THE NOTES BY
CONTACTING THE DIRECTORS, GRIFFIN HOUSE, 161 HAMMERSMITH ROAD, LONDON, W6 8BS,
UNITED KINGDOM.

Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will bear an additional legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS A TEMPORARY GLOBAL NOTE FOR PURPOSES OF REGULATION S.
NEITHER THIS TEMPORARY GLOBAL NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED,
SOLD, DELIVERED OR EXCHANGED FOR AN INTEREST IN A PERMANENT GLOBAL NOTE OR
OTHER NOTE EXCEPT UPON DELIVERY OF THE CERTIFICATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE INDENTURE.

(7) The purchaser acknowledges that the registrar for the Notes will not be required to accept for
registration of transfer of any Notes acquired by them, except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to us, the Trustee and the registrar that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied
with.

(8) The purchaser agrees that it will deliver to each person, to whom it transfers Notes, notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such securities, including the minimum denomination requirements set
forth herein.

(9) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have
been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and
the Initial Purchaser. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account
and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements on
behalf of each such investor account.

(10) The purchaser represents that (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire and hold the Notes
constitutes assets of any employee benefits plan or similar arrangement or (ii) the purchase and holding
of the Notes by it will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or a violation under any applicable similar laws.

(11) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United
States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the
Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required. Consequently, any
transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth hereunder.

(12) The purchaser understands that the Issuer will likely be a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker
Rule. The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity
that would be an “investment company” under the 1940 Act, but for the exclusions provided under
Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it
will be considered a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable
exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. Accordingly, in the event the Issuer is considered a
“covered fund”, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker

304


-----

Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an
“ownership interest” in the Issuer as a “covered fund”, unless such “banking entity” is able to rely on
an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is
broadly defined to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest. The phrase “other similar
interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule to include any interest that: (a) has the right to
participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of
directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the
covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of
default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an investment manager for
“cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s
resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR §248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2));
(b) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the
covered fund; (c) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other
interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies
upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (d) has the right to receive all or a
portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments
received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of
other outstanding interests); (e) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the
covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying
assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding
principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (f) receives
income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by
reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (g) any synthetic right to
have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in (a) through (f) above.

**ERISA Considerations**

By acquiring the Notes, you will be deemed to have further represented and agreed as follows:

(1) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein, (A) either
(i) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of (and for so long as you hold such Notes or any interest
therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), an employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”))
that is subject to the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, a plan to which Section 4975
of the Code, applies, or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” (within the meaning
of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3–101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) by reason of such an
employee benefit plan’s and/or plan’s investment in such entity (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”), or a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other
laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”), and no part of
the assets to be used by you to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets
of any such Benefit Plan Investor or such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, or (ii) your
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note, or any interest therein does not and will not
constitute or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/
or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, a non-exempt
violation of any Similar Laws); and (B) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of
their respective affiliates is a Fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code or, with respect to a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any definition of “fiduciary”
under Similar Laws) with respect to you, as the purchaser or holder, in connection with your purchase
or holding of the Notes, or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
or any of their respective affiliates of any rights in connection with the Notes, and no advice provided
by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates constitutes
“investment advice” (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in
connection with the Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to the Notes.

**Legal Investment Considerations**

If your investment activities are subject to regulation by federal, state or local law or governmental
authorities you should review the applicable laws and/or rules, policies and guidelines adopted from time to time
by such authorities before purchasing any Notes. No representation is made as to the proper characterization of

305


-----

the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any Notes
under applicable law or other legal investment restrictions. Accordingly, if your investment activities are subject
to such laws and/or regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities you should
consult your own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the Notes constitute a legal
investment or are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco or any person who
controls them or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person make any
representation as to the proper characterization of the Notes for legal investment or other purposes, as to the
ability of particular investors to purchase the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of
particular investors to purchase the Notes under applicable investment restrictions. All institutions whose
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by
regulatory authorities should consult their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the
Notes are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the JV Holdco or any person who controls them or any
director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person makes any representation as to
the characterization of the Notes as a U.S.-domestic or foreign (non-U.S.) investment under any state insurance
code or related regulations, and they are not aware of any published precedent that addresses such
characterization. The uncertainties described above (and any unfavorable future determinations concerning legal
investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the Notes) may affect the liquidity of the Notes.

306


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions
in the purchase agreement relating to the Notes between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer has
agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has severally agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the principal amount of Notes set forth therein.

The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the relevant Notes if any of
them are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their
agreement to purchase relevant Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides
that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to approval of legal matters by
counsel and other conditions precedent.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuer has agreed that:

    - Subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act
relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby, issued by the
Issuer and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue for a period of 30 days after
the date hereof without the prior written consent of the Stabilizing Managers.

    - The Issuer will indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make
in respect of those liabilities.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchase of securities.

Each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made by its
purchase acknowledgements, representation, warranties and agreements as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes at the offering price that appears on the cover page
of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and
any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The
offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial
Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser
has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified
Purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and
Regulation S.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales
of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they
will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S.
law.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers
engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

307


-----

In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within
the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is
used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of the pricing of the Notes
(this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the next business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

**Miscellaneous**

This document does not constitute, and may not be used for the purpose of, an offer or solicitation in or
from any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation is not authorized.

Attention is drawn to the information set out on the inside front cover of this document in respect of
restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes and on distribution of documents.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Issuer will apply to list
the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange as soon as practicable after the Issue Date.
The Initial Purchasers are not under an obligation to make a market in the Notes and any market making activity,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the
limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that a secondary market for the Notes will develop, or if one does develop, that it will continue. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of or trading market for the Notes.

No action has been taken or is being contemplated by the Issuer that would permit a public offering of the
Notes or possession or distribution of this offering memorandum or any amendment thereof, or supplement
thereto or any other offering material relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction where, or in any other
circumstances in which, action for those purposes is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or
from any jurisdiction except in circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers. Because of the restrictions
contained in the front of this offering memorandum, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any
offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes.

The Notes are offered when, as and if issued, subject to prior sale or withdrawal, cancellation or
modification of the offer without notice and subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain
other conditions.

Persons into whose hands this offering memorandum comes are required by the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which they
purchase, offer, sell or deliver Notes or have in their possession, distribute or publish this offering memorandum
or any other offering material relating to the Notes, in all cases at their own expense.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in
the future perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending, hedging and
capital markets services for the JV Holdco, Virgin Media, Liberty Global, Telefónica and O2 Holdings, for
which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty Global, Virgin Media, Telefónica, O2 Holdings
and the JV Holdco in the past. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are party to
Facility P under the VM Credit Facility, a portion of which is being repaid with the proceeds of the Notes, and as
a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of, Virgin

-----

Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco and/or their respective affiliates, as applicable, and have hedged, and are
likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV Holdco and/or their
respective affiliates consistent with their risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. If the
Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those
Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates provide Virgin Media, O2
Holdings, the JV Holdco and/or their respective affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and are and
may act as counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by Virgin Media, O2 Holdings, the JV
Holdco and/or their respective affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their
services in such capacities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuer. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/
or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with its registered
office and principal place of business in England. The Issuer is a financing company with no independent
operations or significant assets. As a result, it may not be possible for you to recover any payments of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts or purchase price with respect to the Notes or other payments or claims
in the United States upon judgments of U.S. courts for any such payments or claims. The United States and
England do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of a
fixed debt, sum of money, payment or claim rendered by any U.S. court based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in England. In
order to enforce such a U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must be initiated by way of common law action
before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In this type of action, an English court generally will not
(subject to the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a United States
court and will treat the judgment as conclusive. The matters which may cause an English court not to enforce a
judgment debt created by a United States judgment are that:

    - the relevant U.S. court did not have jurisdiction to give the judgment, or the party against whom the
judgment was given did not properly submit to the jurisdiction of the relevant U.S. court, according to
the applicable English rules of private international law;

    - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement
or a contractual choice of court agreement, unless the party against whom the judgment was given
properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant U.S. court;

    - the judgment was not final and conclusive on the merits. However, a judgment will be treated as final
and conclusive even though it is subject to an appeal or if an appeal is actually pending, although in
such a case a stay of execution in England and Wales may be ordered pending an appeal or possible
appeal. If the judgment is given by a court of a law district forming part of a larger federal system such
as in the United States, the finality and conclusiveness of the judgment in the law district where it was
given alone are relevant in England and Wales. Its finality and conclusiveness in other parts of the
federal system are irrelevant;

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would contravene public policy in England and Wales;

    - the judgment is not for a definite sum of money or is for a sum payable in respect of taxes or other
charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a United States
law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law;

    - enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (for example, section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 prohibits the enforcement of foreign judgments for multiple damages and
other foreign judgments specified by statutory instrument concerned with restrictive trade practices. A
judgment for multiple damages is defined as a judgment for an amount arrived at by doubling, trebling
or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained by the
judgment creditor);

    - the English proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

    - the judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an
English court;

    - the judgment was procured by fraud;

    - the judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the
defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate
opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to
correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment; or

    - recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and
Judgments Act 1982.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a United States judgment, the English
judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to
utilize any method or methods of enforcement available to them at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to

312


-----

obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or
similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

Based on the foregoing and subject to matters referred to in “Description of the Collateral Sharing
_Agreement”, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters_
obtained from United States federal or state courts in the manner described above using the methods available for
enforcement of a judgment of an English court. However, there can be no assurance that you will be able to
enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained in any U.S. court and there is
doubt as to whether an English court would impose civil liability in an action predicated upon the U.S. federal or
state securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The Issuer and certain of the VM Credit Facility Obligors are incorporated in England and Wales, and are
subject to the insolvency laws of England and Wales. The insolvency laws of England and Wales may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the bankruptcy laws of the United States or certain other jurisdictions.
In addition, there can be no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of these jurisdictions will be applied in
relation to one another. In the event that we or any one or more of our subsidiaries experience financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations of us and the VM Credit Facility Obligors, and therefore the ability of the Issuer
to make payments on the Notes.

**Overview of English Insolvency Proceedings**

English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a VM Credit Facility Obligor incorporated under the
laws of England and Wales (an “English Obligor”) experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws
of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an
application to the court for entry into administration, the company, the directors, or the holder of a “qualifying
floating charge” (discussed below) entering into administration or appointing administrators through an out of
court procedure (respectively), or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving
to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be
placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is
reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “U.K. Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is
unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis
(unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or,
among other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to
satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).

English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the obligations of the VM
Credit Facility Obligors. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating
to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their
rights and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the relevant English
Obligor.

Please note that, given the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, the information contained in this section may be
subject to change in light of any further arrangements that are made by the European Union and the U.K. The
following sections therefore outlines the relevant insolvency law considerations in England and Wales as of the
date of this offering memorandum.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Notes Security Documents and the VM Credit Facility Collateral constitute fixed and floating charge
security over the relevant assets subject to such security.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed
of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating
charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation
of such security contained in the relevant floating charge of which the fixed charge holder had notice); (b)
general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders and the costs of

314


-----

continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an
insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets
(including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging
company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in
priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to
property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating
charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
“Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of
certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority
_on insolvency”); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security._

Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the
administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question
towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a proceeding where the relevant company’s assets are sold, the proceeds distributed to
creditors (see “—Priority of claims in an English insolvency proceeding”) and the company dissolved. There are
two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation
(members’ voluntary liquidation where the company is solvent and creditors’ voluntary liquidation where the
company is insolvent), by resolution of the company’s members. The primary ground for the compulsory
winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the U.K.
Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a
resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the
creditors where the company in question is insolvent (including control over the choice of liquidator). As regards
compulsory liquidation, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CIGA has introduced temporary restrictions on
the presentation of winding-up petitions. These restrictions are due to expire on June 30, 2021. Compulsory
liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings may be available to foreign companies with
sufficient nexus to the U.K.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation.
In a compulsory liquidation, under Section 127 of the U.K. Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void
(see “Dispositions in Winding-up” below). However, in certain circumstances this will not apply to any property
or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the
Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance
with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions (including those introduced temporarily in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic pursuant to the CIGA), when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the
court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding
up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or
proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to
such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary liquidation however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the U.K. Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up. Rather, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay,
although note that the ordinary practice is to grant the stay on proceedings brought by a creditor in respect of a
debt that is largely admitted and should be determined in the liquidation not through separate legal proceedings.
This is important because it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and
execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Possible
_challenges”)._

315


-----

**_Priority of claims in an English insolvency proceeding_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in
question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the U.K. Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors
are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property
applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a priorranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari
_passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class._

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” (defined in Rule 14.24(6) of the
Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016) applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime
sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and
only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the
company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets
covers that indebtedness (net of the costs of realizing those assets).

    - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (including liquidators’ and administrators’
remuneration) (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are
paid).

    - Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts
owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension
schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has
been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and
(d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank
equally. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation
under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the
discharge of the ordinary preferential debts.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan
repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding
corporation tax and employer NI contributions). As between one another, secondary preferential debts
rank equally.

    - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This
would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it
but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing
asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below), must,
subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors.

    - Fifth ranking:

       - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets,
as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

316


-----

       - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the VM Credit
Facility, such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be
discharged out of such security recoveries; and

       - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.
This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme
Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017.

    - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

An insolvency office holder of a company (i.e., an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first
£10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over
£10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be
distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the
maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless
the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Administration_**

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act, pursuant to which a company
may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company may be put
into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. English insolvency law
provides that a company may be placed into administration if it is incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a
state in the EEA or if (irrespective of its country of incorporation) it has its COMI in the U.K. or in an EU
member state (other than Denmark). An English court may also place a company into administration upon a
request from the court of another relevant country or territory. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific
conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others, itself, its directors
or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating
charge over the assets of the company also has the right to appoint an administrator. Different procedures apply
according to the identity of the appointer. In addition, a qualifying floating charge holder has the right to
intervene in an administration application by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific
circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. The
essential characteristics of a qualifying floating charge are that: (a) the charge must by its terms give the holder
power to appoint an administrator (or administrative receiver); and (b) the charge (or that and other charges taken
together) must relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant company’s property.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administrator may be appointed (either by a court
or via the out-of-court process) if (which varies depending on the method of appointment): (a) the company
proposed to be the subject of the order is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts”; and (b) the
administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of administration. If a qualifying
floating charge holder appoints an administrator, there is no requirement for the company to be insolvent,
although the floating charge underlying the appointment must be enforceable. Administration proceedings are
supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a
going concern or, if the administrator thinks that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into immediate liquidation or (without first being in
administration), if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a
whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured and/or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out above (see
“—Priority of Claims in an English Insolvency Proceeding”).

317


-----

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order
(in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of an
out-of-court appointment) is filed at the court. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a
full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which creditors cannot take action against the relevant company,
including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the relevant
company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the relevant company’s possession under a hire purchase
agreement without the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for
consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings,
execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above. Certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain
defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the
statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial
collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations. If an English Obligor were to enter
administration, it is possible that the security granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration,
without leave of the court or consent of the administrator.

Claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval generally will be
required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and
processing of claims before interim dividends are paid.

**_Administrative receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very
limited circumstances. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court and,
in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the
security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions under the U.K. Insolvency Act
as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order
to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states
that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning
given by Section 29(2) of the U.K. Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if
such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or
substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a
qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the U.K.
Insolvency Act), which applies if the arrangement creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English
Obligor during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market
investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments,
and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an
undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver
will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the
administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges—see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a
fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited
circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator

318


-----

may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a
charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of
the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration”).

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointer. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who
performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a
proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver
will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed
charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of
the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointer).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors
(see “—Fixed versus floating charges”).

**_Possible challenges_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to the
court to challenge transactions entered into by a company if the company is unable to pay its debts (as defined in
the U.K. Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or if the company becomes unable to pay its debts as a
result of the transaction (see above for a description of when a company may be deemed unable to pay its debts).
Generally, only an administrator or liquidator of a company may bring a claim challenging a reviewable
transaction. However, a challenge to a transaction defrauding creditors under Section 423 of the U.K. Insolvency
Act may be brought by any party that is a victim of the transaction. Moreover, under section 246ZD of the U.K.
Insolvency Act, liquidators and administrators have the ability to assign the cause of action in respect of any
transaction at an undervalue claim, preference claim and extortionate credit claim.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company
making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the
company received significantly less value (in money or money’s worth) than it gave in return. The court has
powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore the position to what it would have been had the company
not entered into that transaction. A court should not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the relevant
company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the
time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. The
court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending
with the onset of insolvency (please see below for details of when the onset of insolvency occurs). The order
could include reducing payments or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection
for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith
for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator
to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a
connected person (see “—Connected Persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the
connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

**_Preferences_**

A transaction might also be challenged as a preference where the relevant company has done something or
suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position
than he would have been in had that thing not been done in the event of the relevant company going into
insolvent liquidation. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to prefer that party. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety
or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what
it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments or
setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific circumstances for a third
party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value
without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to
prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case it is

319


-----

presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must
demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the preference is
given to a person connected to the company (other than an employee), the court looks back and sets aside those
preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of the company’s insolvency.
If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only go back and set aside those preferences entered
into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency.

**_Transactions defrauding creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is
making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This
provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if
the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and,
subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator. There is no
statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the
normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a
result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments or setting
aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor
company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person
who received a benefit from such transaction to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

Furthermore, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit
transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years
before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is
“extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or
were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of
fair dealing. If a transaction entered into by a company is found to be an extortionate credit transaction the court
can make one or more orders specified in the U.K. Insolvency Act, including an order setting aside the whole or
any part of any obligation created by the extortionate credit transaction, an order varying the terms of the
extortionate credit transaction or the terms on which any security for the extortionate credit transaction is held, or
an order requiring any person to pay to the administrator or liquidator any sums paid to that person, by virtue of
the extortionate credit transaction, by the relevant company.

**_Avoidance of floating charges_**

The U.K. Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company
during the “relevant time” may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a
floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to the company, the relevant time is
deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of insolvency and at the time the charge was granted
the company must have been unable to pay its debts or have become unable to pay its debts as a result of the
transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted. If the floating charge is created in favor of a
person connected to the company, the relevant time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency.
A floating charge over a company’s property will be invalid pursuant to Section 245 of the U.K. Insolvency Act
if the floating charge was given in exchange for prior consideration (that is, for example, to secure loans
previously made). However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under
the Financial Collateral Regulations (as amended), the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as
described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for
an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is
automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of any money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or

320


-----

any discharge or reduction of any debt owed by, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of
the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether or not (in the case of a floating charge granted in favor of a
person connected to the company only) the relevant company is unable to pay its debts at the time of grant or
becomes unable to pay its debts as a consequence of the transaction under which the charge was created.

As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that an English Obligor becomes unable
to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the Issue Date (or three years if the transactions are found to
be an extortionate credit transaction), an administrator or liquidator is appointed and the conditions contemplated
in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of the relevant security and/or guarantees may be
challenged by a liquidator or administrator (or any creditor if the transactions are found to be a transaction
defrauding creditors) or a court may set aside the granting of the security and/or guarantees as invalid.

**_Connected persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator. A connected person for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue,
preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such
director or shadow director, or an associate of the relevant company. A person is associated with an individual if
he/she is: (i) the individual’s spouse or civil partner; (ii) a relative of the individual or the individual’s spouse or
civil partner; or (iii) the spouse or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the individual’s spouse or civil
partner. A person is associated with a company if employed by that company. A company is associated with
another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons
who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or
more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be
regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as
replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or
instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration the onset of
insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an
administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the windingup petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a
winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the
initial administration. Pursuant to the CIGA, the concept of the onset of insolvency is temporarily amended in
relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges in the context of a compulsory
liquidation where the winding up order is made based on the company’s inability to pay its debts. This temporary
amendment applies where the winding up petition is presented by a creditor on or before June 30, 2021.

**_Wrongful trading_**

If, in the course of an insolvent winding up or insolvent administration of a company, it appears that a
person who is, or was, a director of the company knew or ought to have concluded at some point before the
commencement of the liquidation or administration that there was no reasonable prospect that the company
would avoid going into insolvent liquidation or insolvent administration, the liquidator or administrator of the
company can seek a court declaration that the director make a contribution to the company’s assets pursuant to
the U.K. Insolvency Act.

Given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rules relating to wrongful trading have been
temporarily suspended, first from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and for a second time from
November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to
them as fixed charges is not determinative.

Where the company or the security provider is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the
chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the
security agent has the requisite degree of control over the company’s or the security provider’s ability to deal in
the relevant assets and the proceeds therefrom and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security agent
in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed
charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of: (i) the
unsecured creditors of the company or the relevant security provider in respect of that part of the company’s or
the security provider’s net property which is ring-fenced (see explanation about the Prescribed Part above); and
(ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the company or the security provider may have priority
over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned
above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent
as floating charge holder. It is also possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to
the whole or substantially the whole of property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a
qualifying floating charge.

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or
other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or
perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be
unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company
that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially
disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power
to disclaim onerous property cannot, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from
any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English
law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the
discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security
interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in
certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and
notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and
relevant legal entities.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed
by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and/or security can be found to be void and the
respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing
with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor in question by virtue of
entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act
in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the relevant English

322


-----

Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or
insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction
may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors
need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not
prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place
when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with
“likely” in this context meaning “probable”.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the
extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

**_Security registration_**

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant
security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to
register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period.
When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to
become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an
order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has
expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with
the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly
does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies although registration with applicable asset
registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Account banks’ right to set-off_**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an “Bank Account Charge”) granted by a security
over certain of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account
**Bank”) may hold a right at any time (whether prior to or following a crystallization event under the Bank**
Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
arrangements with the security provider. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely
floating (rather than a fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the
relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant
Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on
enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the security provider) and the Account
Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account
Bank’s netting and set-off rights.

**_Dispositions in Winding-up_**

Other than set out in this section, any disposition of an English Obligor’s property made after a compulsory
winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a
company is deemed to commence when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company,
rather than the date on which that court makes the winding-up order (if any), subject to certain temporary
amendments introduced by the CIGA in response to COVID-19. A disposition made by a secured party as a
result of the enforcement of security held by it after the presentation of a winding-up petition will not be void
merely because a winding-up petition has already been presented; as such a disposition would be made by the
secured party (or its nominee) and not by the company that is the subject of the winding-up petition.

323


-----

**_Foreign currency_**

Where creditors of an English Obligor are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, and the
debt is payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as any debt arising under the Notes or in respect of
the VM Credit Facility) the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into
sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing on the relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court to
challenge the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into liquidation
or administration and receipt of any amounts to which the Issuer (in respect of the VM Credit Facility) or the
Noteholders (in respect of the Notes) may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are
not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or
any other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to
that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than the England and Wales or is not governed by English law,
the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third parties_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the U.K. Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which
entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or
reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by
way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A
company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with
its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value)
of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement.
However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that is the claims are undersecured. A secured creditor who
proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its
security.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement (“scheme”) that effects a compromise of a
company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may
be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign guarantor which is liable to
be wound up under the U.K. Insolvency Act and has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also
pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb
has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s
finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its
particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the
grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case (particularly where such previous cases pre-date the
transition period).

324


-----

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of
the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in
respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that
will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more
by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the
proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then
that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those
affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then
needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme
and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as
approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_CIGA_**

The U.K. Government introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill into the U.K. Parliament
on May 20, 2020 and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act (“CIGA”) came into effect on June 26,
2020. The U.K. Government also introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)
(Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on September 29, 2020; the
Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Early Termination of Certain Temporary
Provisions) Regulation 2020, which came into effect on October 1, 2020; the Corporate Insolvency and
Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and Extension of the
Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on November 26, 2020; the Corporate Insolvency and
Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) (No 2) Regulations 2020, which came
into effect on December 9, 2020; and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)
(Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021 (together, the “CIGA Regulations”).

The CIGA has introduced significant new corporate restructuring tools to the U.K. insolvency regime. Some
of the new measures are temporary in nature and have been introduced specifically to support businesses
experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CIGA
Regulations have extended the effect of certain temporary measures due to the continuing impact of COVID-19.
The new temporary measures include a suspension of the personal liability of directors for wrongful trading
(which applied retrospectively from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 and for a second period from
November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021). CIGA also introduced a prohibition on the presentation of winding up
petitions on or after April 27, 2020 as a result of a company’s failure to meet a statutory demand served on them
between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. In addition, until June 30, 2021, a creditor cannot present a
winding-up petition based on a company’s inability to pay its debts unless they have reasonable grounds to
believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a financial effect on the company, or the relevant facts giving
rise to such winding-up petition would have arisen even if the COVID-19 pandemic had not had a financial effect
on the company. Other new measures are permanent rather than temporary in nature and may have a significant
impact on the way creditors and others interact with businesses in financial difficulty.

The CIGA has introduced permanent reforms in three key areas: a free-standing moratorium under Part A1
of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Free-standing Moratorium”) (which is not available to companies who are a
party to a capital market arrangement with an issued debt of over £10 million and so is not dealt with further), a
ban on the operation by a supplier of termination provisions which are based on a formal insolvency procedure in
contracts for the supply of goods and/or services (or so called ipso facto clauses), with exemptions for certain
entities and financial contracts and the introduction of a restructuring plan for a company in financial difficulty
under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Part 26A Restructuring Plan”).

The provisions under the CIGA that ban the operation of termination provisions in contracts for the supply
of goods and/or services where the company has entered into a relevant insolvency procedure (including the
Freestanding Moratorium, administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement,
provisional liquidation or a Part 26A Restructuring Plan) will help to prevent the disruption of supply chains but
may have a significant effect on suppliers. The CIGA Regulations extended a temporary measured introduced by
the CIGA, which excludes small suppliers from the effects of restriction on termination through to June 30, 2021.

325


-----

The Part 26A Restructuring Plan offers an alternative to the existing scheme of arrangement. Similar to a
scheme of arrangement the Part 26A Restructuring Plan needs to be approved by the court and requires a creditor
meeting and vote. While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of
arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered,
or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on
business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and
its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of,
any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of
the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement,
affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single
class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed
restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. However, unlike
a scheme of arrangement, subject to certain conditions, the Part 26A Restructuring Plan may bind certain
dissenting classes of creditors, known as a “cross-class cram-down”. This means that a Part 26A Restructuring
Plan may be adopted even where one or more classes do not vote in favor of the plan provided (a) the court is
satisfied that if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were sanctioned no creditor in the dissenting class would be
worse off than it would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario for the company
if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned and (b) the Part 26A Restructuring Plan has been agreed
by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors who would receive a payment, or have a genuine
economic interest in the company, in the event of the most likely alternative scenario referred to in (a) above.
Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Courts are likely to pay particular attention to the
fairness and equity of any cross-class cram-down effected by the proposed arrangement. Once sanctioned, the
restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan.

The cross-class cram-down restructuring procedure in particular has a significant effect on the ability of
creditors and others to commence insolvency proceedings and on the enforcement of rights and legal
proceedings, including, among other things, rights under a floating charge. The provisions under CIGA which
ban the operation of ipso facto clauses will help to prevent the disruption of supply chains but may have a
significant effect on suppliers.

**GLOSSARY**

“3D” means three-dimensional.

“Analog” comes from the word “analogous” which means “similar to” in telephone transmission, the signal
being transmitted (voice, video or image) is “analogous” to the original signal.

“B2B” means business-to-business.

“Bandwidth” means the transmission capacity of a communication line or transmission link at any given
time. The bandwidth is generally indicated in bits per second or amount of spectrum available in MHz.

“Broadband” means a signaling method that includes a relatively wide range of frequencies, which can be
divided into channels or frequency “bins”, and by which various data components are sent at the same time in
order to increase the rate of transmission. The wider the bandwidth, the more information it can carry within a
certain period of time.

“Bundle/bundling” means a marketing strategy that involves offering several products for sale as one
combined product.

“Digital” means the use of a binary code to represent information in telecommunications recording and
computing. Analog signals, such as voice or music, are encoded digitally by sampling the voice or music analog
signals many times a second and assigning a number to each sample. Recording or transmitting information
digitally has two major benefits: First, digital signals can be reproduced more precisely so digital transmission is
“cleaner” than analog transmission and the electronic circuitry necessary to handle digital is becoming cheaper
and more powerful; and second, digital signals require less transmission capacity than analog signals.

“DOCSIS” means Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS), an international standard
that defines the communications and operation support interface requirements for a data over cable system. It
permits the addition of high-speed data transfer to an existing cable TV system. Cable companies use the
DOCSIS standard to improve speeds they can offer. While the DOCSIS 2.0 standard allows regular speeds of up
to 50 Mbps, the new DOCSIS 3.0 broadband technology allows speed levels of 100 Mbps and beyond.

“DSL” means Digital Subscriber Line, a generic name for a range of digital technologies relating to the
transmission of internet and data signals from the telecommunications service provider’s central office to the end
customer’s premises over the standard copper wire used for voice services.

“DTT” means digital terrestrial television which has signals over terrestrial antennas and other earthbound
circuits without any use of satellite.

“DVR” means digital video recorder, a device that allows end users to digitally record television
programming for later playback.

“free-to-air” means the transmission of content for which television viewers are not required to pay a fee
for receiving transmissions.

“FTTH” means network architecture that uses optical fiber to reach the end user’s home in order to deliver
broadband internet services.

“HD” means high-definition television.

“Headend” means a master facility for receiving television signals for processing and distribution over a
cable television system.

“HFC” means network architecture that uses a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to reach the end user’s
street or home in order to deliver broadband internet services.

“IP” means Internet Protocol, or a protocol used for communicating data across a packet-switched network.
It is used for transmitting data over the internet and other similar networks. The data is broken down into data
packets, each data packet is assigned an individual address, then the data packets are transmitted independently
and finally reassembled at the destination.

“IPTV” means Internet Protocol Television, or the transmission of television content using IP over a
network infrastructure, such as a broadband connection.

“LLU” means local loop unbundling. The local loop is the physical link between the first demarcation point
of the customer’s premises and the delivery point into the network of the provider renting the local loop. The
local loop is referred to as the “last mile”.

“LTE” means long-term evolution.

“Mbps” means Megabits per second; a unit of data transfer rate equal to 1,000,000 bits per second. The
bandwidths of broadband networks are often indicated in Mb/s.

**2.** **Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2021:

**_Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 — Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16_**

In August 2020, the IASB issued the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform — Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9,
IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)’. The Phase 2 amendments provide temporary reliefs which address issues
that might affect financial reporting during the interest rate benchmark reform, including the effects of changes to
contractual cash flows or hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with
an alternative benchmark rate. The Phase 2 amendments became effective in 2021.

The Phase 2 amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. The Group continues to follow the developments of interest rate
benchmark reform and intends to use the Phase 2 reliefs when applicable.

    - Defined benefit pension plan — measured at fair value of plan assets

    - Pension benefit obligation — measured at fair value

The amounts in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in millions of
pounds sterling, unless otherwise indicated, and may therefore be rounded.

The Directors have reviewed the business plan for the period to 31 December 2023, and together with the
commitment received from the ultimate parent company to continue providing financial support and on this basis
have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this
interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

**3.2 Going concern**

The Company’s business activity is that of a mobile cellular telecommunications provider and operator. The
Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its financing and business risks successfully.

The Company prepares detailed annual budgets and forecasts as part of its planning process. These budgets
and forecasts are subject to rigorous review which include sensitivity testing of key assumptions, analysis of
growth rates, market guidance and macroeconomic indicators. There are processes in place to review the
appropriateness of financial outlooks regularly and monitor market activity on an ongoing basis. Rate and
volume assumptions are stress tested and triangulated with market insight/trading updates as well as monthly
results and third party economic/other relevant sources. The Directors have reviewed the budgets, forecasts and
business plan which reflects our current view of the impacts of Covid 19 on the business for the period to
31 December 2022. The Company has proved to be resilient, but not entirely immune to the effects of Covid 19.
The need for connectivity by our customers has been just as strong. The Company does not anticipate that an
unexpected fall in volumes and/or prices will result in sustained losses that have a material impact on its ability
to continue in operation. Having considered the impact of a severe but plausible downside scenario for Covid 19,
OIBDA is expected to be a significant positive number and thus causes no concern in respect of going concern
considerations. The Company has demonstrated its ability to pull on sufficient levers to mitigate a significant
impact on profitability and liquidity. In light of this, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to
continue to mitigate the impacts of Covid 19 during 2021 and beyond.

In anticipation of the impending JV merger transaction with Virgin Media during 2021 both Telefonica UK
and Virgin Media have combined to create a joint business plan for the JV. The joint business plan brings
together forward looking forecasts for both businesses, with anticipated synergies and growth opportunities. The
Directors have confidence that the new JV management team will be well placed to grow the business and ensure
that the new JV will be stronger as a combined organisation.

The intercompany loans (including £524m owed to Telfin Ireland with a maturity date of 30 June 2022)
were settled on 26 May 2021 as part of the closing transaction steps. The Directors do not consider the settlement
of intercompany loans to pose any risks from a going concern perspective.

The Company is considered to be in a strong financial position as at 31 March 2021 and has identified no
factors that cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern in future financial reporting periods. The
Directors have noted no significant issues causing them to believe that the going concern assumption is not
appropriate for the Company for the period ended 31 March 2021. Together with the commitment received from
the ultimate parent company to continue providing financial support because of the net current liabilities position,
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. As a result we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing these financial statements.

**3.3 Accounting policies**

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 are consistent with those used in the preparation of
the Group consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2020.

**3.4 Comparison of information**

Comparisons in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements refer to the three
month periods ended 31 March 2021 and 2020, except in the Group interim statement of financial position,
which compares information at 31 March 2021 and at 31 December 2020.

There are no changes in the entities subject to consolidation .

With respect to seasonality, the historical performance of consolidated results does not indicate that the
operations of the Group, taken as a whole, are subject to significant variations between the first and second
halves of the year.

**3.5 Significant events**

In January 2021, the Group announced a new Master Services Agreements for Cornerstone
Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (CTIL), the jointly owned and managed venture between O2 and
Vodafone. The new arrangement will provide operational simplicity and efficiency, in addition it will enable
CTIL to generate revenue by offering space on infrastructure to third parties.

In March 2021, the Group announced an investment of £448m in Ofcom’s spectrum auction to secure the
right spectrum for our business needs. We obtained 8 x 3.6 GHz lots and 2 x 700 MHz paired frequency lots.
This additional spectrum will allow for further coverage and capacity improvements in our network,
demonstrating our continued commitment to the UK Market and the very best connectivity for our customers.

**4.** **Accounting estimates and judgements**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
(other than those involving estimations) in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of certain accounting estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and a reasonably possible change in the facts and circumstances on which these estimates are based
could have a material impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or
in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Significant accounting judgements and estimates**

For additional information on the below significant accounting judgements and estimates refer to the 2020
finanial statements. The Group has used the following significant accounting judgement and accounting
estimates as of 31 March 2021 and 31 December 2020:

Significant accounting judgements:

    - Joint arrangements

Critical accounting estimates:

    - Group pension benefits

    - Group impairment of goodwill

Other key sources of estimation uncertainty:

    - Group property, plant and equipment and licences

    - Group provisions

    - Group right of use assets and lease liabilities — lease terms

The significant accounting judgements and accounting estimates used in the preparation of the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 are consistent with
those used in the preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2020. Inputs and
assumptions have been updated to reflect market condition changes between the periods. Refer to Note 13 for
further information.

The tax assessed for the period varied from the amount computed by applying the UK statutory tax rate to
profit or loss on ordinary activities before taxation. The difference was attributable to the following factors:

In the Spring Budget 2021, the Government announced that from 1 April 2023 the corporation tax rate will
increase to 25%. As the proposal to increase the rate to 25% had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial statements. However, it is likely that the overall effect of
the change, had it been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, would be to increase the tax expense for
the period by £17m, and to increase the deferred tax liability to £71m.

It was also announced that from 1 April 2021 until 31 March 2023, companies investing in qualifying new
plant and machinery assets will be able to claim a 130% super-deduction capital allowance on qualifying
investments. If the proposal had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date there would have been no
effect on these financial statements. It is likely that super-deduction claims will have a significant total tax
impact in the qualifying periods.

The licences are assets permitting the Group to operate its “3G”, “4G” and “5G” networks in the UK.

During the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 amounts of £13 million (2020: £102 million) cost and
£13 million (2020: £102 million) accumulated amortisation were disposed of relating to legacy assets no longer
in use. The disposal had £nil impact on the net book amount of intangible assets.

During the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 the Group purchased 700 MHz of paired licence at a
cost of £280 million and 3.6 GHz of 5G spectrum at a cost of £168 million, both in an Ofcom auction. The Group
also purchased software at a cost of £39 million.

During the year ended 2020, the Group purchased unpaired 2.6GHz of 4G spectrum from EE Limited at a
cost of £83.5 million. This was immediately useable, therefore this was charged immediately to licences in
December 2020 with amortisation commencing January 2021.

During the year ended 2018 the Group secured 80 MHz of spectrum in an Ofcom auction, at a cost of
£523.6 million. This included 40MHz of immediately useable (2.3GHz) spectrum, which was all of the spectrum
available in this band, as well as 40MHz of 3.4 GHz spectrum, earmarked for 5G. The 3.4GHz spectrum was
reclassified from assets in the course of construction to licenses during the year ended 31 December 2019 and
amortisation commenced as the licence was in use from October 2019.

**Impairment testing**

Goodwill arises in relation to the Telefonica UK cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being Telefonica UK
Limited. There has been no impairment during the period and there are no accumulated impairment losses at the
beginning or end of the reporting period.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are certain events or changes
indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units)
to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition date. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying
amount, an irreversible impairment loss is recognised.

The Group evaluates its cash-generating unit performance regularly to identify potential goodwill
impairments. The strategic plan of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated has been used to perform the
impairment test at year-end. The process of preparing the CGU strategic plan takes into consideration the current
condition of the CGU market, analysing the macroeconomic, competitive, regulatory and technological climate
together with the CGU position in this context and the growth opportunities given the market projections and
their competitive positioning.

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash
flow projections from financial budgets covering a five-year period and the headroom calculated between the
enterprise value and value in use is £6,070m.

_Main assumptions used in calculating value in use_

Value in use is calculated based on the approved business plan reflecting the Group’s view of its prospects
at 31 March 2021 taking into account certain variables such as operating income before depreciation and
amortisation (OIBDA) margin, capital expenditure (CAPEX) ratio for non-current assets, expressed as a
percentage of revenue, and discount and perpetuity growth rates.

_OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX_

The OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX ratio used to calculate terminal value, are based on the business
plan approved for the CGU, as well as external estimates of trends in operating indicators, and the outlook for the
various businesses and markets. The rates applied to the cash flow projections were as follows:

Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **14.1** **14.1**

_Discount rate_

The discount rate used by management, applied to measure free cash flow, is the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), determined by the weighted average cost of equity and debt according to the finance structure
established for each CGU.

_Perpetuity growth rate_

Cash flow projections to the end of the asset’s useful life are estimated using a rate of growth for the future
years.

Terminal value is calculated from the projected cash flows in the period, taking as the perpetuity growth rate
consensus estimates among analysts for the business and the country based on the maturity of the industry
depending on technology and the degree of development. Each indicator is compared to the forecast long-term
GDP growth adjusted for any specific characteristics of the business.

The perpetuity growth rate applied to the cash flow projections was as follows:

**31 March 2021** **31 December 2020**

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Group carries out a sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable possible
changes in the main assumptions used in calculating value in use.

Management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying amount to materially exceed the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

**14. Subsidiary undertakings and joint arrangements**

The subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2021 are the same as the presented in the Group consolidated
financial statements as of 31 December 2020.

**15. Investment in joint venture**

**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

In the Spring Budget 2021, the Government announced that from 1 April 2023 the corporation tax rate will
increase to 25%. As the proposal to increase the rate to 25% had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial statements. However, it is likely that the overall effect of
the change, had it been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, would be to increase the tax expense for
the period by £17m, and to increase the deferred tax liability to £71m.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

**Asset retirement provisions**

The Group has certain legal obligations relating to the restoration of leased property to its original condition
at the end of the lease term. This obligation relates principally to the Group’s share of obligation for assets held
in Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited, and to mast sites.

The provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals and the expected
cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but are currently
anticipated to be over the next 16 years.

The provision recognised represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the current statement of financial position date. Such cost estimates, expressed at current price
levels at the date of the estimate are discounted at 31 March 2021 using rates in the range of 0.59% - 1.55%
(2020: 0.59% - 1.55%) per annum. The initial discounted cost amount has been capitalised as part of property,
plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the assets.

**23. Contract assets and liabilities and capitalised costs**

The balance of the contract assets account represents amounts recognised as revenue but not yet due. The
amounts recognised as contract assets are amortised over the contractual period. As of 31 March 2021 contract
assets amounted to £265 million (£287 million as of 31 December 2020), the movement of contract assets during
the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 is mainly related with a decrease in long-term contractual assets
due to the impact of COVID lockdown and the nature of commercial offers in the market.

Capitalised cost decrease during the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 is primarily driven by a shift
of indirect sales to the direct sales channel (see Note 16).

Contract liabilities are unperformed performance obligations mainly related to prepaid airtime, set up fees
and other prepaid services. For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 contract liabilities amounted to
£462 million (£475 million as of 31 December 2020). During the three-month period ended 31 March 2021
contract liabilities decreased primarily driven by revenue recognised in the period and also by a decrease in the
Right of Return liability.

The Company has a single class of shares, comprising of ordinary shares of £1 each. Subject to the
Company’s articles of association and applicable law, the Company’s ordinary shares confer on the holder the
right to receive notice and vote at general meetings of the Company, the right to receive any surplus assets on a
winding up of the Company and an entitlement to receive any dividend declared on ordinary shares, but not the
right of redemption of shares.

**Capital reserve**

On 14 December 2018 the Telefonica UK Pension Plan (“the Plan”) transferred into the Group via a capital
contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited for £23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on
the transfer date. This transfer created a capital reserve in the Group.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

The Group has no contingent liabilities or guarantees on which material losses are expected. The Group has
insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities
arising in the course of its operations.

The Group does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Group. To support our journey to Net Zero, we have
committed £976,000 in 2021 to ensure 500 cell sites are powered by renewable energy.

**27. Retirement benefit schemes**

Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited acted as Sponsor and Principal Employer of the Plan up to 14 December
2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to transfer the plan into the Company as the majority of
employees participating in the plan are employees of the Company. The transfer was made via a capital
contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited for £23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on
the transfer date.

The Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“the Plan”) comprises the following:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan

The net defined benefit expense and actuarial valuation impacts of the defined benefit scheme, as assessed
in accordance with the advice of a qualified, independent actuary, measuring actuarial liabilities using the
projected unit method and taking assets at market value, are recognised in the statement of total comprehensive
income of Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited up to the date of transfer to Telefonica UK limited on 14 December
2018.

The Plan provides the pension benefits for the majority of Telefonica’s UK employees, including those of
Telefonica UK Limited. Participating companies whose employees are members are the Plan account for the
defined benefit sections of the plan as though it were a defined contribution plan as there is no contractual
arrangement or stated policy for charging out the net defined benefit cost between participating employers.
Telefonica UK Limited therefore expensed any contributions payable to the defined benefit sections of the plan
for the period up to 14 December 2018.

With effect from 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan was closed to new entrants and
further benefit accrual. The only funding provided into the defined benefit scheme of the Plan after this date has
been the additional deficit funding payments and the section 75 payment. Members’ defined benefit pensions will
continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the Consumer Prices Index but will not retain the link to
any future increases in salary. Upon closure, members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the
option to become members of the defined contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of
the Plan remains open to new entrants and further contributions and the employer contributions are recognised as
part of the staff costs in the participating entities. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Group’s
finances. The trustee of the Plan acts in accordance with its responsibilities under pension regulations and trust
law. They act in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the Plan and operate independently from the
Group.

The liabilities of the UK defined benefit Unfunded plan are recorded within the statement of financial
position of O2 Holdings Limited, as it relates to ex-employees of O2 Holdings Limited. The costs arising from
the Unfunded plan are borne by O2 Holdings Limited, and are reflected on the statement of comprehensive
income of the Company.

**Actuarial valuation**

A full valuation of the defined benefit section of the Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2017 by a
suitably qualified independent actuary. The valuation used the projected unit method.

F-26


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

The initial results of the actuarial valuation of the Plan as at 30 September 2017 have been updated to
31 March 2021 by a third party qualified actuary in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. The defined
benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are stated at fair value.
The most recent valuation has indicated no material movement on the Group’s previous position.

The Plan’s assets are currently invested in a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked
gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability characteristics.

The amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 March 2021 and
31 December 2020 arising from obligations in respect of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan are as follows:

**28. Financial instruments and capital management**

**28.1 Financial risk factors and management**

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and trade
and other payables. The purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and short term deposits.

The main sources of risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are currency risk, interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk. Management of the Group’s financial risks is achieved mostly through being a part
of the larger Telefónica Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in each area and is able to hedge
positions on a Group basis.

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. No detailed sensitivity analysis is presented, as the Group considers that its risk exposure has been
appropriately mitigated. The principal financial risks of the Group and how the Group manages these risks are
discussed below.

**(a)** **Market risk**

**(i)** **Foreign currency risk**

The Group operates mainly in the United Kingdom. The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange
risks arising from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the Euro and US dollar that can affect
its results and financial position. The impact of any reasonable change in foreign exchange rates would not have
a significant impact on the result of the Group for the year.

The Group also has a small amount of transactional exposure. Such exposure arises from revenues and
purchases by an operating unit that is in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Significant
exposures are managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and the Telefónica Group managing
positions on a Telefónica Group wide basis.

**(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

F-27


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the effects of movements in interest rates on the value of
the Group’s long-term borrowings and interest received on cash and cash equivalents. The Group’s long term
borrowings and other financial assets are at fixed interest rates. The majority of the Group’s cash and cash
equivalents are deposited with a central Telefonica Group company that pays interest at variable market rates.

The impact of any reasonable change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the result of
the Group for the year.

**Effective interest rates and re-pricing analysis**

In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table
indicates the periods in which they re-price or mature (whichever date is earlier). Their effective interest rates at
the statement of financial position date are disclosed in Note 18. Accrued interest has been included in the
analysis.

**(b) Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

The Group’s principal credit risks are attributable to its trade receivables and contract assets. Trade
receivables and contract assets as presented in the statement of financial position are net of provisions for
estimated credit losses.

At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counter-parties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. The Group does
not require collateral in respect of financial assets.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

**(i)** **Trade receivables and contract assets**

The Group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The Group expects that
some debts due will not be paid as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The expected credit
loss rates are based on historical results and future expectations, the economic and competitive environment and
other relevant factors to determine the provision for credit losses. A significant, unanticipated downturn in the
major economies that the Group operates in or negative industry trends could require an increase in the estimated
level of debts that will not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. The exposure to
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. The contract assets relate to unbilled
revenue and have substantially the same characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.

The loss allowance was determined for trade receivables and contract assets for the three-month period
ended 31 March 2021 and 31 December 2020 as follows:

**Contract assets** **Trade receivables**
**31 March** **31 December** **31 March** **31 December**

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the three-month period ended 31 March 2021**

Management of the Group’s liquidity risk is achieved mostly through being a part of the larger Telefónica
Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in this area. The Group holds financial assets primarily in
short-term deposits with a central Telefónica Group company that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash. These measures help keep liquidity risk low.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

The Board of Directors
VMED O2 UK Financing I plc:

**Report on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of VMED O2 UK Financing I plc, which comprise
the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and the related statement of operations, owner’s equity (deficit), and
cash flows for the period from August 10, 2020 (date of inception) to December 31, 2020, and the related notes
to financial statements.

**_Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of VMED O2 UK Financing I plc as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the period from August 10, 2020 (date of inception) to December 31, 2020 in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**Notes to Financial Statements**
**December 31, 2020**

**(1)** **Basis of Presentation**

**_General_**

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc (VMED O2) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global plc (Liberty
**Global). VMED O2 was incorporated on August 10, 2020 as a financing company to facilitate the pending**
formation of the U.K. JV as defined below. In these notes, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company,” and “us” refer
to VMED O2.

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (GAAP). Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into pound sterling are
calculated as of December 31, 2020.

On May 7, 2020, Liberty Global entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement)
with, among others, Telefónica SA (Telefónica). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Liberty Global and
Telefónica agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture (the U.K. JV), which will combine the U.K. operations of Virgin
Media Inc. (Virgin Media), along with certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries created as a result of the
pending U.K. JV, including VMED O2, (together, the U.K. JV Entities) with Telefónica’s mobile business in
the U.K. to create a nationwide integrated communications provider. In advance of this transaction, we
completed certain recapitalization financings, as described in note 3. The outstanding third-party debt associated
with the U.K. JV Entities will be contributed in full to the U.K. JV, and the transaction will not trigger a change
of control under Virgin Media’s debt agreements.

The consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Contribution Agreement is subject to certain
conditions, including competition clearance by the applicable regulatory authorities, which was received on
May 20, 2021. The Contribution Agreement also includes customary termination rights, including a right of the
parties to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed within 24 months following the date of the
Contribution Agreement, which may be extended by six months under certain circumstances. We currently
expect the U.K. JV transaction to close June 1, 2021.

These financial statements reflect our consideration of the accounting and disclosure implications of
subsequent events through May 28, 2021.

**(2)** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are
used in accounting for, among other things, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances and fair
value measurements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and other investments that are readily convertible into cash
and have maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. We record money market funds at the net
asset value as there are no restrictions on our ability, contractual or otherwise, to redeem our investments at the
stated net asset value.

Restricted cash consists of money market funds held in restricted accounts and is classified as current or
long-term based on the expected timing of the disbursement.

**_Financial Instruments_**

Due to the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accrued interest and related party
payables, their respective carrying values approximate their respective fair values. For information concerning
the fair values of our debt, see note 3.

**VMED O2 UK FINANCING I PLC**
**Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)**
**December 31, 2020**

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the financial
statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits, that the position
will be sustained upon examination. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if we
believe it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment
date. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax benefit or expense in our
statements of operations.

For additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 4.

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_**

The functional currency of our company is the pound sterling. The effect of exchange rates on cash balances
held in foreign currencies are separately reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are recorded based on exchange
rates at the time such transactions arise. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our
balance sheet related to these non-functional currency transactions result in transaction gains and losses that are
reflected in our statement of operations as unrealized (based on the applicable period end exchange rates) or
realized upon settlement of the transactions.

**(3)** **Debt**

At December 31, 2020, our third-party debt consists of senior secured notes with a pound sterling equivalent
principal amount of £2,439.7 million and a weighted average interest rate of 3.84%. The weighted average
interest rate represents the stated rates for each debt instrument and does not include the impact of deferred
financing costs.

As of December 31, 2020 our debt had an estimated fair value of £2,505.3 million. The estimated fair values
of our debt instruments are determined using the average of applicable bid and ask prices (Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy). GAAP provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The reported
fair value of this debt as of December 31, 2020 is unlikely to represent the value that will be paid upon the
ultimate settlement or disposition of this liabilities.

The following table provides a reconciliation of total third-party debt before deferred financing costs to total
debt:

**_General Information_**

_Senior Secured Notes. In general, our senior secured notes (i) are senior obligations of the issuer of such_
notes that rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing

addition, the indentures contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows:

    - Our notes provide that any failure to pay principal at its stated maturing (after the expiration of any
applicable grace period) of, or any acceleration with respect to, other indebtedness of the issuer or
certain subsidiaries over agreed minimum thresholds (as specified under the applicable indenture), is an
event of default under the respective notes;

    - Subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed exceptions, our notes
contain (i) certain customary incurrence-based covenants and (ii) certain restrictions that, among other
things, restrict our ability to (a) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (b) make certain
disposals and acquisitions, (c) create certain security interests over our assets and (d) make certain
restricted payments to our direct and/or indirect parent companies through dividends, loans or other
distributions;

    - In the event of a change of control (as specified in the applicable indenture) occurs, we must offer to
repurchase all of the relevant notes at a redemption price of 101%; and

    - Our notes contain certain early redemption provisions including the ability to, during each 12-month
period commencing on the issue date for such notes until the applicable call date (Call Date), redeem
up to 10% of the original principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the

**_Financing Transactions_**

Below we provide summary descriptions of certain financing transactions completed during the year ended
December 31, 2020.

_Senior Secured Notes Transactions. In September 2020, in connection with the pending formation of the_
U.K. JV, VMED O2 UK Financing I plc issued (i) $1,350.0 million (£988.9 million) principal amount of U.S.
dollar-denominated senior secured notes (the 2031 VM O2 Dollar Senior Secured Notes), (ii) €950.0 million
(£850.8 million) principal amount of euro-denominated senior secured notes (the 2031 VM O2 Euro Senior
**Secured Notes) and (iii) £600.0 million principal amount of sterling-denominated senior secured notes (the 2029**
**VM O2 Sterling Senior Secured Notes, and together with the 2031 VM O2 Dollar Senior Secured Notes and**
the 2031 VM O2 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the VM O2 Notes). The 2031 VM O2 Dollar Senior Secured Notes
and 2031 VM O2 Euro Senior Secured Notes were each issued at par, mature on January 31, 2031 and bear
interest at a rate of 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively. The 2029 VM O2 Sterling Senior Secured Notes were issued
at par, mature on January 31, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 4.0%. The proceeds from the issuance of the VM
O2 Notes were placed in certain escrow accounts (the Escrowed Proceeds). Upon formation of the U.K. JV, the
Escrowed Proceeds from the issuance of the VM O2 Notes will be used to fund certain facility loans under the
existing Virgin Media senior secured credit facility agreement to VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 Limited (the New VM
Credit Facility Borrower), an entity that upon closing of the U.K. JV will be within the Virgin Media senior
secured borrowing group. The New VM Credit Facility Borrower will use such loan proceeds for the purpose of
(a) funding a dividend, distribution or other payment to VMED O2 UK Limited (which, upon formation of the
U.K. JV, will become the ultimate parent company of the U.K. JV), and ultimately to Liberty Global and
Telefonica, and (b) paying fees and expenses related to the formation of the U.K. JV. The Escrowed Proceeds are
presented as restricted cash on our balance sheet.

If the formation of the U.K. JV is not consummated on or before May 7, 2022 (the Long Stop Date) or, if
the Long Stop Date is postponed in accordance with the terms of the agreement, on or before November 7, 2022,
or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the VM O2 Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the applicable VM O2 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, up to but excluding the date of the redemption.

**(4)** **Income Taxes**

VMED O2 UK Financing I plc files its income tax return in the U.K. Our income taxes are presented on a
separate return basis. We are in the same U.K. tax group as our ultimate parent company, Liberty Global, and its
other U.K. subsidiaries.

Our entire loss before income taxes of £26.8 million is attributable to our operations in the U.K.

Our income tax benefit attributable to our loss before income taxes differs from the amount computed using
the U.K. corporate income tax rate of 19.0% as a result of the following factors:

In March 2021, legislation was introduced to increase the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19.0% to
25.0% from April 1, 2023. This U.K. rate change has yet to be enacted and we will record any associated impact
in the quarter of enactment.

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of O2 Holdings Limited

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

## Opinion

In our opinion, O2 Holdings Limited’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”):

give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December2020 and of the group’s
and company’s profit and the group’s and company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Group and Company statement
of financial position as at 31 December2020; the Group statement of comprehensive income, Group and Company statement of
changes in equity and the Group and Company statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial
statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.

## Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting included:

Considered the extent to which the Group’s and Company’s future cash flows might be adversely affected by COVID-19 reviewing management’s cash flow forecasts, assessing the existing sources of finance and considering the overall impact
on liquidity, concluding that there was not a material uncertainty related to going concern;
Considered the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements, particularly in the summary of significant accounting
policies - going concern; and
Considered the cash flow forecasts of the combined O2 Holdings and Virgin Media business, as it is likely that the two
businesses will merge in 2021.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for
a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and
the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections
of this report.

 Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK
Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and
matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors' report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors'
report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance
with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and
regulations related to tax legislation, employment regulation, health and safety legislation, Ofcom regulations and other legislation
specific to the industry in which the group operates, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material

effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial
statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent
manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were
related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure, and management bias in determining
accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:

reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions
of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
enquiring of management and the those charged with governance about existing and potential litigation and claims, and
known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;
addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls by testing the appropriateness of journal entries,
including journal entries with unusual account combinations;
challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates that involved
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In particular, in relation to valuation of goodwill and investments, the
completeness of commercial and legal claims against the company, the valuation of defined benefit pension assets and
obliations and the valuation of property, plant & equipment and intangible assets though testing of useful economic lives; and
communicating relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members, including
internal specialists, and reminding them to be alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations
throughout the audit.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements.
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

# Other required reporting

## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**1.** **General information**

O2 Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries and investees (“O2 Holdings”, “the Company”, the “O2 Group” or
“the Group”) is a private company limited by shares and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It is incorporated in
England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and registered in England and Wales under the number
02604354. The address of the Company’s registered office is 260 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire SL1 4DX. The
principal activity of the Group is the operation of a cellular communications network using spectrum held under
licences granted in 1994, 2001, 2013 and 2018 to provide mobile communications services to its customers under
the “O2” and “giffgaff” brands.

Telefónica, S.A. and its subsidiaries and investees (“Telefónica Group”), is the ultimate parent company of
the Group and is a public limited company incorporated on April 19, 1924. Its registered office is at Gran Via 28,
Madrid, Spain.

The functional currency of O2 Holdings Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. The consolidated financial
statements are also presented in pounds sterling.

**2.** **Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2020:

**_Definition of Material — amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8_**

The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors which use a consistent definition of materiality throughout
International Financial Reporting Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, clarify when
information is material and incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

In particular, the amendments clarify:

    - that the reference to obscuring information addresses situations in which the effect is similar to
omitting or misstating that information, and that an entity assesses materiality in the context of the
financial statements as a whole, and

    - the meaning of ‘primary users of general purpose financial statements’ to whom those financial
statements are directed, by defining them as ‘existing and potential investors, lenders and other
creditors’ that must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information
they need.

The Group has analysed the amendment and concluded that they do not have impact on its consolidated
financial statements, nor the comparative financial information however the change in definition is relevant to the
user of the financial statements.

**_Other standards_**

The following amended standards and interpretations were also effective during the year, however, they
have not had a material impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

    - Amendments to references to Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards.

    - Interest rate benchmark reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7).

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

**3.1 Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared using historical cost principles, except for the following:

    - Certain trade receivables held to sell — measured at fair value through profit or loss

    - Defined benefit pension plan — measured at fair value of plan assets

The principal accounting policies of the Group applied in the preparation of these financial statements are
set out below. The IFRS accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented.

The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to
present an individual Company statement of comprehensive income.

**3.2 Going concern**

The Company’s business activity is that of a mobile cellular telecommunications provider and operator. The
financial position of the Company is described on page 35 of the strategic report. In addition, Note 34 to the
financial statements includes the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its
financial risk management objectives; and its exposures to credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The
Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its financing and business risks successfully.

The Company prepares detailed annual budgets and forecasts as part of its planning process. These budgets
and forecasts are subject to rigorous review which include sensitivity testing of key assumptions, analysis of
growth rates, market guidance and macroeconomic indicators. There are processes in place to review the
appropriateness of financial outlooks regularly and monitor market activity on an ongoing basis. Rate and
volume assumptions are stress tested and triangulated with market insight/trading updates as well as monthly
results and third party economic/other relevant sources. The Directors have reviewed the budgets, forecasts and
business plan which reflects our current view of the impacts of Covid 19 on the business for the period to

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

31 December 2022. The Company has proved to be resilient, but not entirely immune to the effects of Covid 19.
The need for connectivity by our customers has been just as strong. The Company does not anticipate that an
unexpected fall in volumes and/or prices will result in sustained losses that have a material impact on its ability
to continue in operation. Having considered the impact of a severe but plausible downside scenario for Covid 19,
OIBDA is expected to be a significant positive number and thus causes no concern in respect of going concern
considerations. The Company has demonstrated its ability to pull on sufficient levers to mitigate a significant
impact on profitability and liquidity. In light of this, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to
continue to mitigate the impacts of Covid 19 during 2021 and beyond.

In anticipation of the impending JV merger transaction with Virgin Media during 2021 both Telefonica UK
and Virgin Media have combined to create a joint business plan for the JV. The joint business plan brings
together forward looking forecasts for both businesses, with anticipated synergies and growth opportunities. The
Directors have confidence that the new JV management team will be well placed to grow the business and ensure
that the new JV will be stronger as a combined organisation.

It is anticipated that intercompany loans (including £524m owed to Telfin Ireland with a maturity date of
30 June 2022) will be settled within their due date or as part of the closing transaction steps should the merger go
ahead as expected. The loan repayments have been factored into the cashflow forecasts and sufficient liquidity
exists to meet obligations as they fall due. The Directors do not consider the settlement of intercompany loans to
pose any risks from a going concern perspective.

The Company is considered to be in a strong financial position as at 31 December 2020 and has identified
no factors that cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern in future financial reporting periods. The
Directors have noted no significant issues causing them to believe that the going concern assumption is not
appropriate for the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020. Together with the commitment received
from the ultimate parent company to continue providing financial support because of the net current liabilities
position, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result we continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Operating items in the statement of comprehensive income are derived from the primary operations of the
Group as a telecommunications provider. Items in the statement of comprehensive income recognised below
operating profit represent activities that are not directly attributable to the Company’s primary operations.

**3.4 Basis of group accounting**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and
its share of jointly controlled entities as at 31 December 2020.

**_Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the
Group has:

    - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

    - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting right result in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group
considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

    - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

F-60


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

    - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or

    - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there
are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control of the
subsidiary.

The financial statements of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date when control commences until control ceases. All principal subsidiary undertakings’ financial years are
co-terminus with those of O2 Holdings Limited.

**3.5 Joint arrangements**

IFRS 11 establishes principles for the financial reporting of parties to joint arrangements. It defines joint
control as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements that
meet the definition of a joint venture are accounted for using the equity method, while joint arrangements that
meet the definition of joint operations are accounted for by integrating assets and liabilities, and the related
revenues and expenses, in proportion to the joint operator’s interest in the arrangement.

**_Joint operations_**

Upon adoption of IFRS 11 in 2014, the Group determined its interests in Cornerstone Telecommunications
Infrastructure Limited, which is engaged in maintaining and managing the non-radio (passive) assets supporting
the mobile wireless network of Vodafone Limited and Telefonica UK Limited, and in Digital Mobile Spectrum
Limited, which is engaged in the provision of services in relation to spectrum auction obligations, to be classified
as joint operations. These are accounted for as joint operations by recognising the assets and liabilities and the
related revenues, expenses and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and
participation in the joint operations.

**_Joint venture_**

The Group determined its interests in Tesco Mobile Limited to be classified as a joint venture. Under the
equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group´s share of net assets of the associate or
joint venture since the acquisition date. The statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group’s share of the
results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Note 19 includes details of the Group’s joint ventures.

**3.6 Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**3.7 Foreign currencies**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial
statements.

In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, the monetary

F-61


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates prevailing at each
reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary
items, are included in the profit of loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of
non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss of the period except for differences arising
on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing
exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates for the
period. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used at the period end date, if
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

**3.8 Revenue from contracts with customers**

Revenue, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises mobile service revenue and
hardware and other revenue (each as described in more detail below).

Mobile service revenue includes revenue earned for usage of the Group’s wireless network for voice, text
message and data transmission by the Group’s customers, subscription fees (including those earned from the
Group’s MVNO partners), inbound roaming (earned from foreign mobile operators whose customers roam onto
the Group’s network), outbound roaming (earned from the Group’s customers roaming outside their domestic
coverage area) and interconnect revenue (earned from other telecommunication operators whose customers
terminate calls on the Group’s network). Subscription fees are recognised over the life of the contract. Roaming
and Interconnect revenues are recognised over time on usage by the customer.

Hardware revenue principally consists of revenue from the sale of mobile devices, including smartphones
and other mobile handsets sold through the Group’s direct distribution channels under the Custom Plans
proposition, where hardware is recognised as a separate performance obligation, as well as the sale of tablets,
smart-tech (e.g. smart watches and fitness devices) and accessories (e.g. mobile phone cases, screen protectors,
chargers, cables, portable batteries, headphones and speakers). Hardware revenue is recognised when the
products are delivered to the customer. Hardware billing will typically include an upfront amount and the
remaining payments are spread over the contract term. Where the implied financing element of these payments is
significant when compared with the other performance obligations in the contract, a portion of the revenue is
allocated to significant financing and is charged to the profit and loss as interest costs over the term of the
contract.

Other revenue principally consists of revenue from the Group’s integrated mobile, Wi-Fi and fixed-line
offerings to business customers and related business offerings, insurance sales and provision of services in
respect of smart metering programme. These revenues are recognised on the provision of both goods and
services, with revenue recognition on delivery of each separate performance obligation.

Under IFRS 15, for bundled packages that combine mobile service, hardware and other revenue, the total
revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone selling prices in relation to the total
consideration of the package and is recognised when (or as) the obligation is satisfied, regardless of whether
there are undelivered items. Consequently, when bundles include a price difference on equipment, the adoption
of these new requirements results in an increase of revenues recognised from the sale of handsets and other
equipment, generally recognised upon delivery to the end customer, offset by a reduction of ongoing service
revenue over subsequent periods. To the extent that the packages are marketed at a price difference, the
difference between the revenue from the sale of equipment and the consideration received from the customer
upfront is recognised as a contract asset on the statement of financial position and amortised over the term of the
contract.

F-62

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

Under IAS 18 Revenue, which was the revenue standard adopted in the year ended 31 December 2017 prior
to the adoption of IFRS 15, the portion of the total consideration that was contingent upon delivery of
undelivered elements was not allocated to delivered elements.

IFRS 15 requires the recognition of an asset for those incremental costs (sales commissions and other third
party acquisition costs) directly related to obtaining a contract and that are expected to be recovered. These are
subsequently amortised over the same period as the revenue associated with such asset. Costs to obtain a contract
are expensed when incurred if the Group estimates that their amortisation period is one year or less.

Payment terms are generally standardised with 14 day terms for Consumers and 30 day terms for Business
customers. No specific provision adjustments are made for payment terms.

**3.9 Operating costs**

Operating costs principally include costs of acquiring, retaining and servicing customers, network and
non-network accommodation costs in relation to the Group’s properties, network maintenance costs, IT and
system support costs and marketing costs. Marketing costs comprising advertising, promotion, sponsorship and
communication are also expensed as incurred.

**3.10 Staff costs**

Staff costs comprise wages and salaries and related direct employment costs for permanent employees.

**3.11 Employee benefits**

**Retirement benefit obligations**

Telefonica UK Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, operates both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that sets the amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions
on behalf of employees and under which there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions
for employees’ service in the current and prior periods.

The Company participates in the Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“Plan”), which provides benefits for the
majority of UK employees in the UK Group. During the period presented, the Plan had the following defined
benefit and defined contribution schemes:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan;

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan; and

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan.

On 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan closed to further benefit accrual. Member
benefits of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan will continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the
Consumer Prices Index (see Note 33), but will not retain the link to any future increases in salary. Upon closure,
members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the option to become members of the defined
contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of the Plan remains open to new entrants and
further accrual. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Company’s finances.

In its capacity as a participating employer in the defined contribution scheme of the Plan, the Group pays
contributions into the Plan on behalf of the employees. The Group has no further obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in the future payments is available.

F-63

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (the Company’s ultimate UK parent company) acted as Sponsor and
Principal Employer of the Plan up to 14 December 2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to
transfer the plan into the Company as the majority of employees participating in the plan are employees of the
Company. The transfer was made via a capital contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited for
£23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on the transfer date. The corresponding net asset was
recorded on the Group statement of financial position. The Company recognises only the unfunded defined
benefit liability on its statement of financial position, as the unfunded scheme is exclusively related to the
Company.

The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension
plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair
value of the plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the
related pension liability.

Accordingly all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and
expense in the period in which they arise.

**Share-based payments**

The Group recognises an expense for share awards and share options, which are equity settled, based on the
fair value of the share awards or share options granted as compensation for the services rendered by employees.
The fair value is calculated at the grant date using an adjusted statistical model and excludes the impact of
non-market conditions. Instead, the expense is adjusted for the effect of non-market conditions at each reporting
date through the number of share awards or share options expected to be exercisable.

The effect of market and non-vesting conditions is included in the fair value at the date of grant and is
recognised as an expense in employee costs irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied. Telefónica S.A. recharges the Group for the cost of share schemes and therefore the share-based
transaction is not settled in the Group’s equity instruments.

**3.12 Financial income and expense**

Financial income principally consists of interest income on Group deposits and gains arising from foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments. Financial expense consists of interest expense on Group borrowings and
losses arising from foreign exchange rate hedging instruments. The Group utilises foreign exchange rate hedging
instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate exposure principally in respect of Euro and US dollar payments with
regard to roaming agreements and not for speculative purposes.

**3.13 Taxation**

The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are
non-assessable or disallowed.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the statement of financial position liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable future taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax and current tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the
deferred income tax liability is settled.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity is also recognised
directly in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

**3.14 Dividends**

Interim dividend distributions are recognised in the period in which they are paid. Final dividend
distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period
in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s Board. Income is recognised when the company’s rights
to receive the payment is established. Dividends received from subsidiary companies are recognised as finance
income in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are received.

**3.15 Leases**

The Group adopted the following IFRS 16 Leases accounting policies from 1 January 2019.

Adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in almost all leases being recognised in the statement of financial position,
since the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed for lessee accounting. Under the new
standard, an asset (that is, the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The Group has elected not to apply the general requirements to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The Group has also elected not to recognise non-lease components separately from lease components for those
classes of assets in which non-lease components are not significant with respect to the total value of the
arrangement.

The Group acts as a lessee on a large number of lease agreements. These include leases of third party mobile
masts (towers), circuits, office buildings and stores and land where towers are located. These contracts were
generally accounted for as operating leases under previous accounting standards, with lease payments being
recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement over the contract term.

Right of use assets are initially recognised at the initial measurement of lease liabilities plus any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date; less any lease incentives received; plus any initial direct
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring
the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and
conditions of the lease.

Right of use assets are subsequently measured using the cost model by charging depreciation to profit and
loss over the term of the lease and adjusting for any remeasurement of the lease liability or impairment of the
asset.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined, or the
incremental borrowing rate of interest required to finance the expected payments during the lease term. Lease
payments included in initial measurement comprise fixed payments, less any incentives receivable; variable lease
payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees; the
exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments for
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the contract, together with any period
covered by an extension (or termination) option whose exercise is discretionary for the Group, if there is
reasonable certainty that it will be exercised (or it will not be exercised). In its assessment, the Group considers
all available information by asset class in the industry and evaluates all relevant factors (technology, regulation,
competition, business model) that create an economic incentive to exercise or not a renewal/cancellation option.
In particular, the Group takes into consideration the time horizon of the strategic planning of its operations. After
the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in
circumstances that is within its control that may affect its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) an option to
extend or terminate (for example, a change in business strategy).

Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability; reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and remeasuring the carrying amount
to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. Interest will be charged to profit and loss.

**3.16 Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and
equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate

Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment from the date they are available for use over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

The lives assigned to property, plant and equipment are:

**Land and buildings**
Freehold Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years
Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Unexpired portion of lease or 40 years whichever is
the shorter

**Plant and equipment**
Network assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 to 20 years
Computers and office equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 to 5 years

The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of
financial position date. No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount
of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.

Property, plant and equipment not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be
depreciated. Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of property, plant
and equipment and will be depreciated in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.17 Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiaries, represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the
date of acquisition.

After initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is
recognised as an asset denominated in the currency of the Group acquired and is tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently if there are certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may
not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit (or group of cash generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition
date.

**_Radiocommunications Licences_**

Licence fees paid to the Government, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined
periods, are capitalised at cost less impairment losses and are amortised from the date of commercial launch of

the service over the initial 20 year term of the licence on a straight line basis. The remaining useful lives of the
licences are as follows:

**Licence** **Remaining useful life**

3G – 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 years
4G – 800 MHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 years
4G – 2.3 GHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 years
4G – 2.6 GHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 years
5G – 3.4 GHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 years

**_Software_**

Software is capitalised and measured at the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software of between 2 and 6 years on a straight
line basis. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable unique software products
controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits over a period of more than one year,
are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as intangible assets are
amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software not exceeding 6 years on a straight line basis.

Development costs are only capitalised if the Group can demonstrate all of the following: the technical
feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale; an intention to complete the asset
and use or sell it; an ability to use or sell the asse; future economic benefit is expected; adequate technical,
financial and other resources are available; and an ability to reliably measure expenditure.

Intangible assets not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be amortised.
Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of intangible assets and will be
amortised in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.18 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (“cash-generating units”).

**3.19 Investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

**3.20 Inventories**

Inventories comprise mainly handsets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a
first-in, first-out basis, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost comprises costs of purchase and costs incurred in
bringing inventory to its current location and condition.

**3.21 Financial assets**

_(i)_ _Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

    - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through
profit or loss); and

    - those to be measured at amortised cost.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

_(ii) Recognition and derecognition_

Financial assets are recognised on the date the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

Trade receivables that are sold without recourse are derecognised at the point they are factored. Any fee
incurred to effect factoring is netted against cash received and expensed in the income statement.

_(iii) Measurement_

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or
loss.

_(iv) Impairment_

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk.

The Group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The Group expects that
some debts due will not be paid as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The Group uses
estimates based on historical results and future expectations, the economic and competitive environment and
other relevant factors to determine the provision for credit losses. A significant, unanticipated downturn in the
major economies that the Group operates in or negative industry trends could require an increase in the estimated
level of debts that will not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. The level of
provision required is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The carrying amount of credit losses provision for each
reporting period is set out in Note 34.1.

**3.22 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. Cash and cash
equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less, and short term deposits repayable on demand with Telefónica
Finanzas S.A and Telfisa Global B.V., both of which are related parties. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**3.23 Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between the cost and the redemption value being recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. Accrued interest on
borrowings is included within the carrying value.

**3.24 Trade and other payables**

Trade payables and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in
the ordinary course of business from suppliers. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer). If not, they are presented as
non-current liabilities.

Trade payables and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**3.25 Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used,
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Restructuring provisions could comprise, amongst other items, employee termination payments, and these
are recognised in the period in which the Group becomes legally or constructively committed to payment. A
provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition of the site.

**4.** **Accounting estimates and judgements**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
(other than those involving estimations) in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of certain accounting estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and a reasonably possible change in the facts and circumstances on which these estimates are based
could have a material impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or
in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Significant accounting judgements**

The Group has the following significant accounting judgement where making a different judgment may
result in a material adjustment to the income and expenses reported for the period and to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities at the end of the period.

**_Joint arrangements_**

The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with
one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either
a joint operation or as a joint venture which depends on management’s assessment of the legal form and
substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners
have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.

The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group accounts
for its interest in its joint operation by recognising the assets and liabilities and the related revenues, expenses
and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and participation in the joint operation.

The Group’s investment and share of results of joint ventures are accounted for under the equity
method where the share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively.

**_Revenue_**

Key judgements include revenue recognition and in particular the determination of stand-alone selling price
for handsets by reviewing prices against external market conditions and handset airtime based on SIM only
airtime pricing averaged over a rolling six month period when applying IFRS 15.

**_Litigation_**

Where the Group has identified the existence of a legal dispute, there is often a significant amount of
judgement required when determining the likelihood, value and/or timing of any obligation that may exist.

**Critical accounting estimates**

The critical assumptions concerning the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting
period that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are discussed below.

**_4.1 Group pension benefits_**

The cost of the defined benefit pension plan and the present value of the pension obligation are determined
using an actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the
discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the
valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds
with at least an AA rating, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined
benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publically available mortality tables. Future salary increases and
pension increases are based in expected future inflation rates.

Further details about the assumptions and sensitivities are given in Note 33.

**_4.2 Company impairment of investments_**

An impairment exists when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted
cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from forecasts. The recoverable amount is most

Sensitive to the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected cash inflows
and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. Further details about the assumptions and sensitivities are
given in Note 18.

**Other key sources of estimation uncertainty**

Other key sources of estimation uncertainty which are not expected to give rise to a material adjustment in
the reporting period are discussed below.

**_4.3 Group property, plant and equipment and licences_**

Accounting for property, plant and equipment and licences involves the use of estimates and judgements for
determining the useful lives over which they are to be depreciated or amortised and the existence and amount of
any impairment.

Property, plant and equipment and licences are depreciated or amortised on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful lives and taking into account their expected residual values. When the Group estimates useful
lives various factors are considered including expected technological obsolescence and the expected usage of the
asset. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect the estimated
current remaining lives in light of technological changes, future economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned. A significant change in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation and
amortisation charges for the period.

It is not practicable to quantify the impact of changes in property, plant and equipment asset lives on an
overall basis as asset lives are individually determined and there is a significant number of assets in use. The
impact of any change would vary significantly depending on the individual changes in assets and the classes of
assets impacted.

The Group assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and licences whenever there is reason
to believe that the carrying value may not exceed the fair value and where a permanent impairment in value is

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

anticipated. The determination of whether the impairment of these assets is necessary involves the use of
estimates that includes, but is not limited to, the analysis of the cause of potential impairment in value, the timing
of such potential impairment and an estimate of the amount of the impairment.

The Group considers technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other changes in
circumstances as indications of the need to perform an impairment test. A significant change in the facts and
circumstances that were relied upon in making the estimates may trigger the requirement for recording
impairment and may have a material adverse impact on the operating results and financial condition of the
Group. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and licences for each reporting period is set out in
Notes 13 and 15 respectively.

**_4.4 Group provisions_**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. This obligation may be legal or constructive deriving from regulations, contracts,
normal practices or public commitments that lead third parties to reasonably expect that the Group will assume
certain responsibilities. The amount of the provision is determined based on the best estimate of the outflow of
resources required to settle the obligation, taking into account all available information including but not limited
to external legal advice, as appropriate.

Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of provision, actual outflows
of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the basis of the estimates.

The asset retirement provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals
and the expected cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but
are currently anticipated to be over the next 17 years.

The carrying amount of provisions for each reporting period is set out in Note 27.

**_4.5 Group right of use assets and lease liabilities — lease terms_**

The lease term used in the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities is estimated. Lease term
estimates are based on the non-cancellable period; plus periods covered by options to extend the lease, where
such options depend only on the Group and where exercise is assessed to be reasonably certain, taking into
account the specific situation of the lease. In addition certain assumptions have been required to calculate the
discount rate, based principally on the incremental borrowing rate of interest required to finance the expected
payments during the lease term.

**5.** **Operating segments**

As at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the Group had only one reportable segment, which is the
mobile telecommunications business in the UK.

The mobile telecommunications segment derives revenue from the operation of a cellular communications
network, and the sale of mobile and data services to the Group’s customer base.

In the Spring Budget 2021, the Government announced that from 1 April 2023 the corporation tax rate will
increase to 25%. As the proposal to increase the rate to 25% had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial statements. However, it is likely that the overall effect of
the change, had it been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, would be to increase the tax expense for
the period by £17m, and to increase the deferred tax liability to £71m.

The licences are assets permitting the Group to operate its “3G”, “4G” and “5G” networks in the UK.

During the year ended 2018 the Group secured 80 MHz of spectrum in an Ofcom auction, at a cost of
£523.6 million. This included 40MHz of immediately useable (2.3GHz) spectrum, which was all of the spectrum
available in this band, as well as 40MHz of 3.4 GHz spectrum, earmarked for 5G. The 3.4GHz spectrum was
reclassified from assets in the course of construction to licenses during the year ended 31 December 2019 and
amortisation commenced as the licence was in use from October 2019.

During the year ended 2020 amounts of £102 million (2019: £392 million) cost and £102 million (2019:
£392 million) accumulated amortisation were disposed of relating to legacy assets no longer in use. The disposal
had £nil impact on the net book amount of intangible assets.

During the year ended 2020, the Group purchased unpaired 2.6GHz of 4G spectrum from EE Limited at a
cost £83.5 million. This was immediately useable, therefore this was charged immediately to licences in
December 2020 with amortisation commencing January 2021.

**Impairment testing**

Goodwill arises in relation to the Telefonica UK cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being Telefonica UK
Limited. There has been no impairment during the year and there are no accumulated impairment losses at the
beginning or end of the reporting period.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are certain events or changes
indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units)
to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition date. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying
amount, an irreversible impairment loss is recognised.

The Group evaluates its cash-generating unit performance regularly to identify potential goodwill
impairments. The strategic plan of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated has been used to perform the
impairment test at year-end. The process of preparing the CGU strategic plan takes into consideration the current
condition of the CGU market, analysing the macroeconomic, competitive, regulatory and technological climate
together with the CGU position in this context and the growth opportunities given the market projections and
their competitive positioning.

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash
flow projections from financial budgets covering a five-year period and the headroom calculated between the
enterprise value and value in use is £6,070m.

_Main assumptions used in calculating value in use_

Value in use is calculated based on the approved business plan reflecting the Group’s view of its prospects
at 31 December 2020 taking into account certain variables such as operating income before depreciation and
amortisation (OIBDA) margin, capital expenditure (CAPEX) ratio for non-current assets, expressed as a
percentage of revenue, and discount and perpetuity growth rates.

_OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX_

The OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX ratio used to calculate terminal value, are based on the business
plan approved for the CGU, as well as external estimates of trends in operating indicators, and the outlook for the
various businesses and markets. The rates applied to the cash flow projections were as follows:

Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **14.1** 12.5

_Discount rate_

The discount rate used by management, applied to measure free cash flow, is the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), determined by the weighted average cost of equity and debt according to the finance structure
established for each CGU.

The pre-tax discount rate, applied to the cash flow projections was as follows:

_Perpetuity growth rate_

Cash flow projections to the end of the asset’s useful life are estimated using a rate of growth for the future
years.

Terminal value is calculated from the projected cash flows in the period, taking as the perpetuity growth rate
consensus estimates among analysts for the business and the country based on the maturity of the industry
depending on technology and the degree of development. Each indicator is compared to the forecast long-term
GDP growth adjusted for any specific characteristics of the business.

The perpetuity growth rate applied to the cash flow projections was as follows:

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Group carries out a sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable possible
changes in the main assumptions used in calculating value in use. The sensitivities to changes in these
assumptions are included in Note 18.

Management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying amount to materially exceed the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

2 Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited holds a direct investment in Telefonica UK Limited of £23 million as a
result of the transfer of the pension scheme from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited into Telefonica UK
Limited on 14 December 2018 (see Note 33).

3 CTIL had a loss for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £40m (2019: loss of £47m) and total equity of
£134m (2019: £175m).

All share holding portions remain the same as at 31 December 2019 with the exception of Telefonica

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are
certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The
potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the investments in subsidiary
undertakings. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

In the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 the impairment review identified that no
additional impairment was required to be recognised in relation to the Company’s investments. The recoverable
amount, being the value in use of the investments in Telefonica UK Limited, O2 Cedar Limited and O2
Networks Limited, was concluded to be not less than the net book amount. Refer to Note 16 for key assumptions
used in the impairment test performed during the year.

The recoverable amount of the investments in the other subsidiary undertakings have been assessed based
on the net assets of those entities at 31 December 2020 and was concluded to be not less than the net book
amount.

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Company carries out its sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable changes in
the main assumptions used in calculating value in use. The changes in assumptions if applied individually to the
value in use calculation would have the following impacts for the year ended 31 December 2020, expressed in
percentage points:

**Assumption** **Change** **Valuation impact** **Change** **Valuation impact**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. £1,698 million +0.50p.p. -£1,403 million
Perpetuity growth rates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. -£1,176 million +0.50p.p. £1,422 million
Terminal OIBDA Margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. -£355 million +0.50p.p. £355 million
Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. £438 million +0.50p.p. -£438 million

Management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount, with significant
headroom remaining after performing sensitivity analysis. Details of the Company’s subsidiaries are provided in
Note 17.

**19. Investment in joint venture**

The Group holds a 50% interest in Tesco Mobile Limited, a mobile virtual network operator, which is
accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements.

There were no unrecognised Company deferred tax assets or liabilities at 31 December 2020 (2019: £nil).

In the Spring Budget 2021, the Government announced that from 1 April 2023 the corporation tax rate will
increase to 25%. As the proposal to increase the rate to 25% had not been substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial statements. However, it is likely that the overall effect of
the change, had it been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, would be to increase the tax expense for
the period by £17m, and to increase the deferred tax liability to £71m.

**Restructuring provisions**

Restructuring provisions include the full costs of planned business restructuring programmes, entered into
during prior years. No programmes were entered into in 2020 and all programmes are expected to complete in
2021.

**Asset retirement provisions**

The Group has certain legal obligations relating to the restoration of leased property to its original condition
at the end of the lease term. This obligation relates principally to the Group’s share of obligation for assets held
in Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited, and to mast sites.

The provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals and the expected
cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but are currently
anticipated to be over the next 16 years.

The provision recognised represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the current statement of financial position date. Such cost estimates, expressed at current price
levels at the date of the estimate are discounted at 31 December 2020 using rates in the range of 0.59% — 1.55%
(2019: 1.26% — 1.67%) per annum. The initial discounted cost amount has been capitalised as part of property,
plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the assets.

**32. Share-based payments**

**Equity-settled share options scheme**

The main share-based payment plans in place during the period are as follows:

**_Telefonica Performance Investment Share Plan 2018-2022_**

The Telefónica, S.A. General Shareholders’ Meeting on 8 June 2018 approved a new instalment of the longterm share-based incentive “Performance and Investment Plan” for certain senior executives and members of the
management team of the Telefonica Group.

The term of the plan is a total of five years divided into three phases, each of a three year duration. The first
cycle was deemed to have started on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the
Plan, employees will be entitled to receive a certain maximum number of shares of Telefónica S.A., upon
fulfillment of certain requirements, namely:

1. The final delivery of shares is conditional upon the employee remaining in the entity’s employ during
the vesting period.

2. The final number of shares granted is subject to certain performance conditions based on:

a. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered upon achievement of a certain Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) target that must be satisfied during the period in which the evolution of the TSR of the
Telefónica Group is measured.

b. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered if a certain free cash flow (“FCF”) target is met.

Thus, if certain performance levels and FCF targets are achieved, the employee is entitled to receive 100%
of the maximum number of shares awarded, whereas if only one of the targets is met, the employee shall receive
the related shares.

468,234 shares were assigned in the first phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked shares
and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

562,558 shares were assigned in the second phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked
shares and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

307,259 shares were assigned in the third phase with a fair value of €3.21 per share for the FCF linked
options and €1.64 per share for TSR linked options.

**_Talent for the future Share Plan (TFSP) 2018-2022_**

The TFSP is a long-term programme aimed to recognise and reward employees with consistent outstanding
performance, with high potential and key skills.

At the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica S.A. held on 8 June 2018, a long-term share-based
incentive plan called “Talent for the Future Share Plan” was approved for certain Telefonica Group employees.

Under this Plan, a certain number of shares of Telefónica S.A. will be delivered to participants selected by
the company who have opted to take part in the scheme and meet the requirements and conditions stipulated to
this end.

The term of the plan is a total of five years divided into three phases, each of a three year duration. The first
cycle was deemed to have started on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the

Plan, employees will be entitled to receive a certain maximum number of shares of Telefónica S.A., upon
fulfillment of certain requirements, namely:

1. The final delivery of shares is conditional upon the employee remaining in the entity’s employ during
the vesting period.

2. The final number of shares granted is subject to certain performance conditions based on:

a. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered upon achievement of a certain Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) target that must be satisfied during the period in which the evolution of the TSR of the
Telefónica Group is measured.

b. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered if a certain free cash flow (“FCF”) target is met.

Thus, if certain performance levels and FCF targets are achieved, the employee is entitled to receive 100%
of the maximum number of shares awarded, whereas if only one of the targets is met, the employee shall receive
the related shares.

53,000 shares were assigned in the first phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked sharess
and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

49,250 shares were assigned in the second phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked
sharess and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

63,000 shares were assigned in the third phase with a fair value of €3.21 per share for the FCF linked
options and €1.64 per share for TSR linked options.

**_Global Employee Share Plan 2019-2021_**

The Global Employee Share Plan 2019 was launched on 20 May 2019. Under the plan employees were
offered the option to acquire Telefónica S.A. shares during a twelve-month period (the acquisition period), with
the company undertaking to deliver a certain number of free shares to participants, subject to certain
requirements.

The total term of the plan is two years. Employees joining the plan could acquire Telefónica S.A. shares
through maximum monthly instalments of €150 (or the local currency equivalent) up to a maximum of €1,800
over a period of 12 months (acquisition period) and the minimum contribution to be made by each participant
would be €25 per month. Those employees who hold the shares for a further twelve months after the end of the
acquisition period, are entitled to receive one free share for every two acquired shares, within the Plan conditions.

The acquisition period commenced in July 2019 and will end in June 2020. The plan’s shareholding period
will come to an end in July 2021. Shares will be delivered in July 2021 at the end of the vesting period.

The total share based payment expense booked to the profit and loss statement is included in Note 8 Key
management and Directors’ compensation.

**33. Retirement benefit schemes**

Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited acted as Sponsor and Principal Employer of the Plan up to 14 December
2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to transfer the plan into the Company as the majority of
employees participating in the plan are employees of the Company. The transfer was made via a capital
contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited for £23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on
the transfer date.

The Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“the Plan”) comprises the following:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan

The net defined benefit expense and actuarial valuation impacts of the defined benefit scheme, as assessed
in accordance with the advice of a qualified, independent actuary, measuring actuarial liabilities using the
projected unit method and taking assets at market value, are recognised in the statement of total comprehensive
income of Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited up to the date of transfer to Telefonica UK limited on 14 December
2018.

The Plan provides the pension benefits for the majority of Telefonica’s UK employees, including those of
Telefonica UK Limited. Participating companies whose employees are members are the Plan account for the
defined benefit sections of the plan as though it were a defined contribution plan as there is no contractual
arrangement or stated policy for charging out the net defined benefit cost between participating employers.
Telefonica UK Limited therefore expensed any contributions payable to the defined benefit sections of the plan
for the period up to 14 December 2018.

With effect from 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan was closed to new entrants and
further benefit accrual. The only funding provided into the defined benefit scheme of the Plan after this date has
been the additional deficit funding payments and the section 75 payment. Members’ defined benefit pensions will
continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the Consumer Prices Index but will not retain the link to
any future increases in salary. Upon closure, members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the
option to become members of the defined contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of
the Plan remains open to new entrants and further contributions and the employer contributions are recognised as
part of the staff costs in the participating entities. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Group’s
finances. The trustee of the Plan acts in accordance with its responsibilities under pension regulations and trust
law. They act in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the Plan and operate independently from the
Group.

The liabilities of the UK defined benefit Unfunded plan are recorded within the statement of financial
position of O2 Holdings Limited, as it relates to ex-employees of O2 Holdings Limited. The costs arising from
the Unfunded plan are borne by O2 Holdings Limited, and are reflected on the statement of comprehensive
income of the Company.

The total charge included in the statement of comprehensive income for the Group’s entire pension schemes
are as follows:

**Actuarial valuation**

A full valuation of the defined benefit section of the Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2017 by a
suitably qualified independent actuary. The valuation used the projected unit method.

The initial results of the actuarial valuation of the Plan as at 30 September 2017 have been updated to
31 December 2020 by a third party qualified actuary in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. The defined
benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are stated at fair value.

The Plan’s assets are currently invested in a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked
gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability characteristics. An £80 million contribution was paid to the defined
benefit scheme by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: £25 million).

Plan assets are valued by reference to quoted market prices in active markets.

At 31 December 2020, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation of the funded plan
was 22 years (2019: 22 years).

The position and results reported are subject to the accuracy of the assumptions used.

A reduction in the discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A rise in the discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

An increase in the inflation rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A reduction in the inflation rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

There is also uncertainty around the future life expectancy of the UK population. The value of current and
future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.

The following table summarises the estimated sensitivity of the disclosed liability value to changes in the
principal assumptions that have been used in the calculations:

**Change of assumption:** **Liabilities increase by:**

Decrease discount rate by 0.25% £104 million
Increase inflation rate by 0.25% £100 million
Increase life expectancy by 1 year £64 million

**Investment commentary**

As at 31 December 2020, the Plan was fully invested in line with the SIP. The Plan’s assets were invested in
a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability

characteristics. This strategy is achieved through a mixture of direct investments in the target asset classes and
derivatives. This includes the Liability Driven Investment strategy which aims to reduce the Plan’s exposure to
interest rate and inflation risk.

The figures above are as at the statement of financial position date. Market values of Plan’s assets, which
are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant changes before they are realised.
All equity securities and credit opportunities have quoted prices in active markets.

**Risks**

The main risks to which the Group are exposed in relation to the Plan are:

**_Longevity risk_**

The assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from
the Plan and consequently increases in the Plan’s liabilities. The Group and the Plan’s Trustee reviews the
mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.

**_Investment risk_**

The Plan invests its assets in a portfolio of global corporate bonds, liquid credit and synthetic equity, with a
Liability Driven Investment overlay to provide interest and inflation rate hedging. The Plan’s liabilities are
valued with respect to long dated bond yields, so the value of assets and liabilities may move out of line as
investment conditions change. In addition because the duration of the Plan’s assets is shorter than the duration of
the Plan’s liabilities, there is a risk that the Trustee will not be able to reinvest the Plan’s assets at assumed rates.
The Plan’s Trustee reviews the structure of the investment portfolio on a regular basis to minimise these risks.

**_Yield risk_**

A fall in bond yields will increase both the value of the Plan’s assets and liabilities. The Plan hedges a large
part of this risk but still has some exposure to changes in yields. As a result there is a risk that the value of the
liabilities may grow in monetary terms by more than the value of the Plan’s assets, creating a deficit in the Plan.

**_Inflation risk_**

The majority of the Plan’s liabilities increase in line with inflation and so if inflation is greater than
expected, the liabilities will increase. The Plan has hedged some of the inflation risk and will continue to monitor
this risk.

**Other pension plans**

The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme in the UK. The assets of these defined contribution
arrangements are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The expense, in
the statement of comprehensive income, relating to the defined contribution section of the Plan is equal to the
contributions paid over the period presented, which totaled £40 million for the year ended 31 December 2020
(2019: £38 million).

**34. Financial instruments and capital management**

**34.1 Financial risk factors and management**

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and trade
and other payables. The purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and short term deposits.

The main sources of risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are currency risk, interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk. Management of the Group’s financial risks is achieved mostly through being a part
of the larger Telefónica Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in each area and is able to hedge
positions on a Group basis.

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. No detailed sensitivity analysis is presented, as the Group considers that its risk exposure has been
appropriately mitigated. The principal financial risks of the Group and how the Group manages these risks are
discussed below.

**(a)** **Market risk**

**(i)** **Foreign currency risk**

The Group operates mainly in the United Kingdom. The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange
risks arising from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the Euro and US dollar that can affect
its results and financial position. The impact of any reasonable change in foreign exchange rates would not have
a significant impact on the result of the Group for the year.

The Group also has a small amount of transactional exposure. Such exposure arises from revenues and
purchases by an operating unit that is in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Significant
exposures are managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and the Telefónica Group managing
positions on a Telefónica Group wide basis.

**(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

F-99


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the effects of movements in interest rates on the value of
the Group’s long-term borrowings and interest received on cash and cash equivalents. The Group’s long term
borrowings and other financial assets are at fixed interest rates. The majority of the Group’s cash and cash
equivalents are deposited with a central Telefonica Group company that pays interest at variable market rates.

The impact of any reasonable change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the result of
the Group for the year.

**Effective interest rates and re-pricing analysis**

In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table
indicates the periods in which they re-price or mature (whichever date is earlier). Their effective interest rates at
the statement of financial position date are disclosed in Note 23. Accrued interest has been included in the
analysis.

**(b) Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

The Group’s principal credit risks are attributable to its trade receivables and contract assets. Trade
receivables and contract assets as presented in the statement of financial position are net of provisions for
estimated credit losses.

At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counter-parties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. The Group does
not require collateral in respect of financial assets.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**(i)** **Trade receivables and contract assets**

The Group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The Group expects that
some debts due will not be paid as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The expected credit
loss rates are based on historical results and future expectations, the economic and competitive environment and
other relevant factors to determine the provision for credit losses. A significant, unanticipated downturn in the
major economies that the Group operates in or negative industry trends could require an increase in the estimated
level of debts that will not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. The exposure to
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. The contract assets relate to unbilled
revenue and have substantially the same characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.

The loss allowance was determined for trade receivables and contract assets at 31 December 2020 and
31 December 2019 as follows:

Management of the Group’s liquidity risk is achieved mostly through being a part of the larger Telefónica
Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in this area. The Group holds financial assets primarily in
short-term deposits with a central Telefónica Group company that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash. These measures help keep liquidity risk low.

**36. Contingent Liabilities**

**_Phones 4u_**

Legal proceedings have been issued in the High Court against the Group by the Administrators of Phones
4u. The Group has vigorously denied the allegations and filed its defence to this claim in April 2019. No
provision has been made in relation to this matter.

**37. Other matters**

As disclosed in previous years the Group has been addressing a request for disclosure made by
governmental authorities which is related to possible violations of anti-bribery laws and regulations. The Group
continues to co-operate with the governmental authorities investigating this matter which is still ongoing. Also
the Group continues to conduct its own internal investigation on the matter. Whilst it is not possible at this time
to predict the full scope or duration of this matter or its eventual outcome, the Group considers it can make a
reliable estimate of the outcome and has made an accrual for this amount at 31 December 2020 (31 December
2019 : an accrual was made).

Additional disclosures of the matters required by IAS 37 have not been provided as permitted by IAS37
para 92 as the directors believe that further disclosure will be seriously prejudicial to future developments on this
matter.

**38. Subsequent events**

In January 2021, we announced a new Master Services Agreements for Cornerstone Telecommunications
Infrastructure Limited (CTIL), the jointly owned and managed venture between O2 and Vodafone. The new
arrangement will provide operational simplicity and efficiency, in addition it will enable CTIL to generate
revenue by offering space on infrastructure to third parties.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**1.** **General information**

O2 Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries and investees (“O2 Holdings”, “the Company”, the “O2 Group” or
“the Group”) is a private company limited by shares and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It is incorporated
under the Companies Act 2006 and registered in England and Wales under the number 02604354. The address of
the Company’s registered office is 260 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire SL1 4DX. The principal activity of the
Group is the operation of a cellular communications network using spectrum held under licences granted in 1994,
2001, 2013 and 2018 to provide mobile communications services to its customers under the “O2” and “giffgaff”
brands.

Telefónica, S.A. and its subsidiaries and investees (“Telefónica Group”), is the ultimate parent company of
the Group and is a public limited company incorporated on April 19, 1924. Its registered office is at Gran Via 28,
Madrid, Spain.

The functional currency of O2 Holdings Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. The consolidated financial
statements are also presented in pounds sterling.

**2.** **Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2019:

**_IFRS 16 Leases_**

On 1 January 2019 the new IFRS 16 Leases accounting standard became effective, resulting in changes in
the accounting policies applied in prior periods.

The standard sets out the requirements for recognising right of use assets and lease liabilities. The Group has
adopted IFRS 16 using one of two transition methods: the modified retrospective transition method, with the
cumulative effect from initial application recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
at the date of initial application, 1 January 2019. Accordingly, the 2018 information presented for comparative
purposes has not been restated i.e. it is prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting standards
effective during that period: under IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.

Under the provisions in IFRS 16, it is possible to elect to apply certain practical expedients to reduce
complexity in the application of the new requirements. The main practical expedients applied by the Group are:

    - Lease assessment: the Group did not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease on the date of
initial application of IFRS 16 for all contracts identified as leases under previous accounting standards.

    - Right of use asset measurement: for a vast majority of leases previously classified as an operating lease
the Group recognised a right of use asset at the date of initial application measured at an amount equal
to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that
lease recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial
application.

    - Discount rates: the Group applies a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar
characteristics such as lease term, class of underlying asset, currency and economic environment.

    - Initial direct costs: the Group excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right of use
asset at the date of initial application.

The Group did not need to make any adjustments to the accounting for assets held as lessor under operating
leases as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

The details of the new significant accounting policies and the nature of the main changes to previous
accounting policies in relation to lease accounting under the new model in IFRS 16 are set out in Note 3. The
most significant impacts relate to the first-time recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities; reduction in
operating lease rental expenses in profit and loss; increase in lease interest expense and right of use depreciation
charges in profit and loss. The most significant impact on cash flows is the reclassification of lease principal and
interest payments to financing activities that were previously classified as lease rental payments in operating
activities.

The impacts of adopting IFRS 16 on the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019
are set out below:

(a) The decrease in operating costs is driven by a reduction in lease expenses as these have been replaced by
depreciation of right of use assets and interest costs on lease obligations.

(b) The increase in right of use depreciation expense is related to the recognition of new right of use assets that
are depreciated over the lease term.

(c) The increase in lease interest expense is related to interest on recognition of lease obligations.

(d) The right of use assets reflect the contractual right to use assets over a period of time in exchange for
consideration.

(e) The decrease in trade and other receivables and increase in trade and other payables is primarily driven by
timing differences between when lease payments are made and interest charges are applied.

(f) The increase in lease liabilities relates to the recognition of the present value of lease payments due on right
of use assets held.

(g) The decrease in provisions relates to certain leased properties that would have been recognised as onerous
leases under previous accounting standards but under IFRS 16 the liability was already recognised within
lease liabilities.

**2.2 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
31 December 2019 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. Those that are expected to
have an impact on the Group are set out below.

**_Definition of Material — amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8_**

The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors which use a consistent definition of materiality throughout
International Financial Reporting Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, clarify when
information is material and incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

In particular, the amendments clarify:

    - that the reference to obscuring information addresses situations in which the effect is similar to
omitting or misstating that information, and that an entity assesses materiality in the context of the
financial statements as a whole, and

    - the meaning of ‘primary users of general purpose financial statements’ to whom those financial
statements are directed, by defining them as ‘existing and potential investors, lenders and other
creditors’ that must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information
they need.

The Company does not expect the change in definition of Material to significantly impact the financial
statements however the change in definition is relevant to the user of the financial statements.

**_Definition of a Business — amendments to IFRS 3_**

The amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an input and a substantive process
that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is
amended to focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating investment income and other income,

F-119

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. The amendments will likely result
in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions.

**_Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture — amendments to_**
**_IFRS 10 and IAS 28_**

The IASB has made limited scope amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28
Investments in associates and joint ventures.

The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for sales or contribution of assets between an investor and
its associates or joint ventures. They confirm that the accounting treatment depends on whether the non-monetary
assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a ‘business’ (as defined in IFRS 3 Business
Combinations).

Where the non-monetary assets constitute a business, the investor will recognise the full gain or loss on the
sale or contribution of assets. If the assets do not meet the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised
by the investor only to the extent of the other investor’s interests in the associate or joint venture. The
amendments apply prospectively.

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

**3.1 Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations,
as adopted for use in the EU. In addition the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared using historical cost principles, except for the following:

    - Certain trade receivables held to sell — measured at fair value through profit or loss

    - Defined benefit pension plan — measured at fair value of plan assets

The principal accounting policies of the Group applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out
below. The IFRS accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented.

The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present an
individual Company statement of comprehensive income.

The Directors have reviewed the business plan for the period to 31 December 2021, and together with the
commitment received from the ultimate parent company to continue providing financial support and on this basis
have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
annual financial statements.

The impact to the Company from COVID-19 is described in detail on pages 30 to 32. The Company has shown
resilience throughout this turbulent period and the need for connectivity by our customers has been just as strong.
The impact to the Company has been modest considering the challenges faced across the global economy. In
light of this, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to continue to mitigate the impacts of
COVID-19 during 2020 and beyond.

**3.2 Presentation of financial information**

Operating items in the statement of comprehensive income are derived from the primary operations of the Group
as a telecommunications provider. Items in the statement of comprehensive income recognised below operating
profit represent activities that are not directly attributable to the Company’s primary operations.

F-120

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**3.3 Basis of group accounting**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and its
share of jointly controlled entities as at 31 December 2019.

**_Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

    - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

    - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

    - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting right result in control. To support this presumption and
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

    - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

    - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or

    - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control of the
subsidiary.

The financial statements of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date
when control commences until control ceases. All principal subsidiary undertakings’ financial years are
co-terminus with those of O2 Holdings Limited.

**3.4 Joint arrangements**

IFRS 11 establishes principles for the financial reporting of parties to joint arrangements. It defines joint control
as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions about the
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements that meet the
definition of a joint venture are accounted for using the equity method, while joint arrangements that meet the
definition of joint operations are accounted for by integrating assets and liabilities, and the related revenues and
expenses, in proportion to the joint operator’s interest in the arrangement.

**_Joint operations_**

Upon adoption of IFRS 11 in 2014, the Group determined its interests in Cornerstone Telecommunications
Infrastructure Limited, which is engaged in maintaining and managing the non-radio (passive) assets supporting
the mobile wireless network of Vodafone Limited and Telefonica UK Limited, and in Digital Mobile Spectrum
Limited, which is engaged in the provision of services in relation to spectrum auction obligations, to be classified
as joint operations. These are accounted for as joint operations by recognising the assets and liabilities and the
related revenues, expenses and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and
participation in the joint operations.

**_Joint venture_**

The Group determined its interests in Tesco Mobile Limited to be classified as a joint venture. Under the equity
method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of

F-121


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group´s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture
since the acquisition date. The statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group’s share of the results of
operations of the associate or joint venture. Note 19 includes details of the Group’s joint ventures.

**3.5 Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**3.6 Foreign currencies**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial
statements.

In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at
the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, the monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates prevailing at each reporting date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are
included in the profit of loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary
items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss of the period except for differences arising on the
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing
exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates for the
period. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used at the period end date, if
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

**3.7 Revenue from contracts with customers**

Revenue, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises mobile service revenue and hardware
and other revenue (each as described in more detail below).

Mobile service revenue includes revenue earned for usage of the Group’s wireless network for voice, text
message and data transmission by the Group’s customers, subscription fees (including those earned from the
Group’s MVNO partners), inbound roaming (earned from foreign mobile operators whose customers roam onto
the Group’s network), outbound roaming (earned from the Group’s customers roaming outside their domestic
coverage area) and interconnect revenue (earned from other telecommunication operators whose customers
terminate calls on the Group’s network).

Hardware revenue principally consists of revenue from the sale of mobile devices, including smartphones and
other mobile handsets sold through the Group’s direct distribution channels under the Refresh proposition, where
hardware is recognised as a separate performance obligation, as well as the sale of tablets, smart-tech (e.g. smart
watches and fitness devices) and accessories (e.g. mobile phone cases, screen protectors, chargers, cables,
portable batteries, headphones and speakers). Hardware revenue is recognised when the products are delivered to
the customer. Hardware billing will typically include an upfront amount and the remaining payments are spread
over the contract term. Where the implied financing element of these payments is significant when compared
with the other performance obligations in the contract, a portion of the revenue is allocated to significant
financing and is charged to the profit and loss as interest costs over the term of the contract.

Other revenue principally consists of revenue from the Group’s integrated mobile, Wi-Fi and fixed-line offerings
to business customers and related business offerings and insurance sales. These revenues are recognised on the

F-122


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

provision of both goods and services, with revenue recognition on delivery of each separate performance
obligation.

Under IFRS 15, for bundled packages that combine mobile service, hardware and other revenue, the total revenue
is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone selling prices in relation to the total
consideration of the package and is recognised when (or as) the obligation is satisfied, regardless of whether
there are undelivered items. Consequently, when bundles include a price difference on equipment, the adoption
of these new requirements results in an increase of revenues recognised from the sale of handsets and other
equipment, generally recognised upon delivery to the end customer, offset by a reduction of ongoing service
revenue over subsequent periods. To the extent that the packages are marketed at a price difference, the
difference between the revenue from the sale of equipment and the consideration received from the customer
upfront is recognised as a contract asset on the statement of financial position and amortised over the term of the
contract.

Under IAS 18 Revenue, which was the revenue standard adopted in the year ended 31 December 2017 prior to
the adoption of IFRS 15, the portion of the total consideration that was contingent upon delivery of undelivered
elements was not allocated to delivered elements.

IFRS 15 requires the recognition of an asset for those incremental costs (sales commissions and other third party
acquisition costs) directly related to obtaining a contract and that are expected to be recovered. These are
subsequently amortised over the same period as the revenue associated with such asset. Costs to obtain a contract
are expensed when incurred if the Group estimates that their amortisation period is one year or less.

**3.8 Operating costs**

Operating costs principally include costs of acquiring, retaining and servicing customers, network and
non-network accommodation costs in relation to the Group’s properties, network maintenance costs, IT and
system support costs and marketing costs. Marketing costs comprising advertising, promotion, sponsorship and
communication are also expensed as incurred.

**3.9 Staff costs**

Staff costs comprise wages and salaries and related direct employment costs for permanent employees.

**3.10 Employee benefits**

**Retirement benefit obligations**

Telefonica UK Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, operates both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that sets the amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions
on behalf of employees and under which there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions
for employees’ service in the current and prior periods.

The Company participates in the Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“Plan”), which provides benefits for the
majority of UK employees in the UK Group. During the period presented, the Plan had the following defined
benefit and defined contribution schemes:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan;

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan; and

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan.

On 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan closed to further benefit accrual. Member
benefits of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan will continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the

F-123


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

Consumer Prices Index (see Note 33), but will not retain the link to any future increases in salary. Upon closure,
members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the option to become members of the defined
contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of the Plan remains open to new entrants and
further accrual. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Company’s finances.

In its capacity as a participating employer in the defined contribution scheme of the Plan, the Group pays
contributions into the Plan on behalf of the employees. The Group has no further obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in the future payments is available.

Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) (the Company’s ultimate UK parent
company) acted as Sponsor and Principal Employer of the Plan up to 14 December 2018. On this date a deed was
signed by the trustees to transfer the plan into the Company as the majority of employees participating in the plan
are employees of the Company. The transfer was made via a capital contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings
Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) for £23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on the
transfer date. The corresponding net asset was recorded on the Group statement of financial position. The
Company recognises only the unfunded defined benefit liability on its statement of financial position, as the
unfunded scheme is exclusively related to the Company.

The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension
plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair
value of the plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the
related pension liability.

Accordingly all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and
expense in the period in which they arise.

**Share-based payments**

The Group recognises an expense for share awards and share options, which are equity settled, based on the
fair value of the share awards or share options granted as compensation for the services rendered by employees.
The fair value is calculated at the grant date using an adjusted statistical model and excludes the impact of
non-market conditions. Instead, the expense is adjusted for the effect of non-market conditions at each reporting
date through the number of share awards or share options expected to be exercisable.

The effect of market and non-vesting conditions is included in the fair value at the date of grant and is
recognised as an expense in employee costs irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied. Telefónica S.A. recharges the Group for the cost of share schemes and therefore the share-based
transaction is not settled in the Group’s equity instruments.

**3.11 Financial income and expense**

Financial income principally consists of interest income on Group deposits and gains arising from foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments. Financial expense principally consists of interest expense on Group
borrowings and losses arising from foreign exchange rate hedging instruments. The Group utilises foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate exposure principally in respect of Euro and
US dollar payments with regard to roaming agreements and not for speculative purposes.

**3.12 Taxation**

The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are
non-assessable or disallowed.

F-124

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the statement of financial position liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable future taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax and current tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the
deferred income tax liability is settled.

Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity is also recognised
directly in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

**3.13 Dividends**

Interim dividend distributions are recognised in the period in which they are paid. Final dividend
distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period
in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s Board. Income is recognised when the company’s rights
to receive the payment is established. Dividends received from subsidiary companies are recognised as finance
income in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are received.

**3.14 Leases**

The Group adopted the following IFRS 16 Leases accounting policies from 1 January 2019.

Adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in almost all leases being recognised in the statement of financial position,
since the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed for lessee accounting. Under the new
standard, an asset (that is, the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The Group has elected not to apply the general requirements to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The Group has also elected not to recognise non-lease components separately from lease components for those
classes of assets in which non-lease components are not significant with respect to the total value of the
arrangement.

The Group acts as a lessee on a large number of lease agreements. These include leases of third party mobile
masts (towers), circuits, office buildings and stores and land where towers are located. These contracts were
generally accounted for as operating leases under previous accounting standards, with lease payments being
recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement over the contract term.

Right of use assets are initially recognised at the initial measurement of lease liabilities plus any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date; less any lease incentives received; plus any initial direct
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring
the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and
conditions of the lease.

Right of use assets are subsequently measured using the cost model by charging depreciation to profit and
loss over the term of the lease and adjusting for any remeasurement of the lease liability or impairment of the
asset.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined, or the
incremental borrowing rate of interest required to finance the expected payments during the lease term. Lease
payments included in initial measurement comprise fixed payments, less any incentives receivable; variable lease
payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees; the
exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments for
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

F-125

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the contract, together with any period
covered by an extension (or termination) option whose exercise is discretionary for the Group, if there is
reasonable certainty that it will be exercised (or it will not be exercised). In its assessment, the Group considers
all available information by asset class in the industry and evaluates all relevant factors (technology, regulation,
competition, business model) that create an economic incentive to exercise or not a renewal/cancellation option.
In particular, the Group takes into consideration the time horizon of the strategic planning of its operations. After
the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in
circumstances that is within its control that may affect its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) an option to
extend or terminate (for example, a change in business strategy).

Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability; reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and remeasuring the carrying amount
to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. Interest will be charged to profit and loss.

Information on the impact of initial application of IFRS 16 is disclosed in Note 2.

**3.15 Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and
equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment from the date they are available for use over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

The lives assigned to property, plant and equipment are:

**Land and buildings**
Freehold Buildings 40 years
Leasehold buildings Unexpired portion of lease or 40 years whichever is the shorter

**Plant and equipment**
Network assets 5 to 20 years
Computers and office equipment 2 to 5 years

The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of
financial position date. No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount
of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.

Property, plant and equipment not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be
depreciated. Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of property, plant
and equipment and will be depreciated in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.16 Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiaries, represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the
date of acquisition.

After initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is
recognised as an asset denominated in the currency of the Group acquired and is tested for impairment annually,

F-126


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

or more frequently if there are certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may
not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit (or group of cash generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition
date.

**_Radiocommunications Licences_**

Licence fees paid to the Government, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined
periods, are capitalised at cost less impairment losses and are amortised from the date of commercial launch of
the service over the initial 20 year term of the licence on a straight line basis. The remaining useful lives of the
licences are as follows:

**Licence** **Remaining useful life**

3G – 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 years
4G – 800 MHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 years

**_Software_**

Software is capitalised and measured at the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software of between 2 and 6 years on a straight
line basis. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable unique software products
controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits over a period of more than one year,
are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as intangible assets are
amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software not exceeding 6 years on a straight line basis.

Development costs are only capitalised if the Group can demonstrate all of the following: the technical
feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use or sale; an intention to complete the asset
and use or sell it; an ability to use or sell the asse; future economic benefit is expected; adequate technical,
financial and other resources are available; and an ability to reliably measure expenditure.

Intangible assets not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be amortised.
Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of intangible assets and will be
amortised in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.17 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (“cash-generating units”).

**3.18 Investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

**3.19 Inventories**

Inventories comprise mainly handsets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a
first-in, first-out basis, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost comprises costs of purchase and costs incurred in
bringing inventory to its current location and condition.

**3.20 Financial assets**

_(i) Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

    - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through
profit or loss); and

    - those to be measured at amortised cost.

_(ii) Recognition and derecognition_

Financial assets are recognised on the date the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

Trade receivables that are sold without recourse are derecognised at the point they are factored. Any fee
incurred to effect factoring is netted against cash received and expensed in the income statement.

_(iii) Measurement_

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or
loss.

_(iv) Impairment_

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk.

The Group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The Group expects that
some debts due will not be paid as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The Group uses
estimates based on historical results and future expectations, the economic and competitive environment and
other relevant factors to determine the provision for credit losses. A significant, unanticipated downturn in the
major economies that the Group operates in or negative industry trends could require an increase in the estimated
level of debts that will not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. The level of
provision required is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The carrying amount of credit losses provision for each
reporting period is set out in Note 34.1.

**3.21 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. Cash and cash
equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less, and short term deposits repayable on demand with Telefónica
Finanzas S.A and Telfisa Global B.V., both of which are related parties. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**3.22 Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between the cost and the redemption value being recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. Accrued interest on
borrowings is included within the carrying value.

**3.23 Trade and other payables**

Trade payables and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in
the ordinary course of business from suppliers. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer). If not, they are presented as
non-current liabilities.

Trade payables and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**3.24 Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used,
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Restructuring provisions could comprise, amongst other items, employee termination payments, and these
are recognised in the period in which the Group becomes legally or constructively committed to payment. A
provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition of the site.

**4.** **Accounting estimates and judgements**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
(other than those involving estimations) in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of certain accounting estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and a reasonably possible change in the facts and circumstances on which these estimates are based
could have a material impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or
in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Significant accounting judgements**

The Group has the following significant accounting judgement where making a different judgment may
result in a material adjustment to the income and expenses reported for the period and to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities at the end of the period.

**_Joint arrangements_**

The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with
one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either
a joint operation or as a joint venture which depends on management’s assessment of the legal form and
substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners
have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.

The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group accounts
for its interest in its joint operation by recognising the assets and liabilities and the related revenues, expenses
and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and participation in the joint operation.

The Group’s investment and share of results of joint ventures are accounted for under the equity
method where the share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively.

**Critical accounting estimates**

The critical assumptions concerning the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting
period that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are discussed below.

**_4.1 Group pension benefits_**

The cost of the defined benefit pension plan and the present value of the pension obligation are determined
using an actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the
discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the
valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds
with at least an AA rating, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined
benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publically available mortality tables. Future salary increases and
pension increases are based in expected future inflation rates.

Further details about the assumptions and sensitivities are given in note 33.

**_4.2 Company impairment of investments_**

An impairment exists when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted
cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from forecasts. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the
discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected cash inflows and the growth rate
used for extrapolation purposes. Further details about the assumptions and sensitivities are given in note 18.

**Other key sources of estimation uncertainty**

Other key sources of estimation uncertainty which are not expected to give rise to a material adjustment in
the reporting period are discussed below.

**_4.3 Group property, plant and equipment and licences_**

Accounting for property, plant and equipment and licences involves the use of estimates and judgements for
determining the useful lives over which they are to be depreciated or amortised and the existence and amount of
any impairment.

Property, plant and equipment and licences are depreciated or amortised on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful lives and taking into account their expected residual values. When the Group estimates useful
lives various factors are considered including expected technological obsolescence and the expected usage of the
asset. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect the estimated
current remaining lives in light of technological changes, future economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned. A significant change in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation and
amortisation charges for the period.

It is not practicable to quantify the impact of changes in property, plant and equipment asset lives on an
overall basis as asset lives are individually determined and there is a significant number of assets in use. The
impact of any change would vary significantly depending on the individual changes in assets and the classes of
assets impacted.

The Group assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and licences whenever there is reason
to believe that the carrying value may not exceed the fair value and where a permanent impairment in value is
anticipated. The determination of whether the impairment of these assets is necessary involves the use of
estimates that includes, but is not limited to, the analysis of the cause of potential impairment in value, the timing
of such potential impairment and an estimate of the amount of the impairment.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

The Group considers technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other changes in circumstances
as indications of the need to perform an impairment test. A significant change in the facts and circumstances that
were relied upon in making the estimates may trigger the requirement for recording impairment and may have a
material adverse impact on the operating results and financial condition of the Group. The carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment and licences for each reporting period is set out in Notes 13 and 15 respectively.

**_4.4 Group provisions_**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. This obligation may be legal or constructive deriving from regulations, contracts,
normal practices or public commitments that lead third parties to reasonably expect that the Group will assume
certain responsibilities. The amount of the provision is determined based on the best estimate of the outflow of
resources required to settle the obligation, taking into account all available information.

Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of provision, actual outflows
of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the basis of the estimates.

The asset retirement provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals
and the expected cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but
are currently anticipated to be over the next 17 years.

The carrying amount of provisions for each reporting period is set out in Note 27.

**_4.5 Group right of use assets and lease liabilities — lease terms_**

The lease term used in the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities is estimated. Lease term
estimates are based on the non-cancellable period; plus periods covered by options to extend the lease, where
such options depend only on the Group and where exercise is assessed to be reasonably certain, taking into
account the specific situation of the lease. In addition certain assumptions have been required to calculate the
discount rate, based principally on the incremental borrowing rate of interest required to finance the expected
payments during the lease term.

**5.** **Operating segments**

As at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, the Group had only one reportable segment, which is the
mobile telecommunications business in the UK.

The mobile telecommunications segment derives revenue from the operation of a cellular communications
network, and the sale of mobile and data services to the Group’s customer base.

The licences are assets permitting the Group to operate its “3G”, “4G” and “5G” networks in the UK.

During the prior year the Group secured 80 MHz of spectrum in an Ofcom auction, at a cost of
£523.6 million. This included 40MHz of immediately useable (2.3GHz) spectrum, which was all of the spectrum
available in this band, as well as 40MHz of 3.4 GHz spectrum, earmarked for 5G. The 3.4GHz spectrum was
reclassified from assets in the course of construction to licenses during the year ended 31 December 2019 and
amortisation commenced as the licence was in use from October 2019.

During the year ended 31 December 2019 amounts of £392 million cost and £392 million accumulated
amortisation were disposed of relating to legacy assets no longer in use. The disposal had £Nil impact on the net
book amount of intangible assets.

During the year ended 31 December 2018 a transfer was made from property, plant and equipment to
software amounting to £59 million to better present certain assets. Additional amortisation of £29 million was
charged in the year relating to the population of assets affected to record amortisation at the rate appropriate for
the assets.

**Impairment testing**

Goodwill arises in relation to the Telefonica UK cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being Telefonica UK
Limited. There has been no impairment during the year and there are no accumulated impairment losses at the
beginning or end of the reporting period.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are certain events or changes
indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units)
to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition date. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying
amount, an irreversible impairment loss is recognised.

The Group evaluates its cash-generating unit performance regularly to identify potential goodwill
impairments. The strategic plan of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated has been used to perform the
impairment test at year-end. The process of preparing the CGU strategic plan takes into consideration the current
condition of the CGU market, analysing the macroeconomic, competitive, regulatory and technological climate
together with the CGU position in this context and the growth opportunities given the market projections and
their competitive positioning.

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash
flow projections from financial budgets covering a five-year period.

_Main assumptions used in calculating value in use_

Value in use is calculated based on the approved business plan reflecting the Group’s view of its prospects
at 31 December 2019 taking into account certain variables such as operating income before depreciation and
amortisation (OIBDA) margin, capital expenditure (CAPEX) ratio for non-current assets, expressed as a
percentage of revenue, and discount and perpetuity growth rates.

_OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX_

The OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX ratio used to calculate terminal value, are based on the business
plan approved for the CGU, as well as external estimates of trends in operating indicators, and the outlook for the
various businesses and markets. The rates applied to the cash flow projections were as follows:


**Year ended**
**31 December**
**2019**
**%**

Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **12.5** 13.0

_Discount rate_

The discount rate used by management, applied to measure free cash flow, is the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), determined by the weighted average cost of equity and debt according to the finance structure
established for each CGU.

_Perpetuity growth rate_

Cash flow projections to the end of the asset’s useful life are estimated using a rate of growth for the future
years.

Terminal value is calculated from the projected cash flows in the period, taking as the perpetuity growth rate
consensus estimates among analysts for the business and the country based on the maturity of the industry
depending on technology and the degree of development. Each indicator is compared to the forecast long-term
GDP growth adjusted for any specific characteristics of the business.

The perpetuity growth rate applied to the cash flow projections was as follows:

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Group carries out a sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable possible
changes in the main assumptions used in calculating value in use. The sensitivities to changes in these
assumptions are included in Note 18.

Management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying amount to materially exceed the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

2 Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) holds a direct investment in Telefonica
UK Limited of £23 million as a result of the transfer of the pension scheme from Telefonica O2 Holdings
Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) into Telefonica UK Limited on 14 December 2018 (see note 33).

On 30 April 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Statiq Limited for a cash consideration of
£715,000, from Telefonica Digital Limited, a fellow subsidiary within the Telefónica Group.

All share holding portions remain the same as at 31 December 2018, with the exception of the acquisition of
Statiq Limited.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are
certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The
potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the investments in subsidiary
undertakings. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

In the years ended 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 the impairment review identified that no
additional impairment was required to be recognised in relation to the Company’s investments. The recoverable
amount, being the value in use of the investments in Telefonica UK Limited, O2 Cedar Limited and O2
Networks Limited, was concluded to be not less than the net book amount. Refer to note 16 for key assumptions
used in the impairment test performed during the year.

The recoverable amount of the investments in the other subsidiary undertakings have been assessed based
on the net assets of those entities at 31 December 2019 and was concluded to be not less than the net book
amount.

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Company carries out its sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable changes in
the main assumptions used in calculating value in use. The changes in assumptions if applied individually to the
value in use calculation would have the following impacts for the year ended 31 December 2019, expressed in
percentage points:

**Assumption** **Change** **Valuation impact** **Change** **Valuation impact**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. £1,614 million +0.50p.p. -£1,341 million
Perpetuity growth rates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. -£1,119 million +0.50p.p. £1,347 million
Terminal OIBDA Margin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. -£381 million +0.50p.p. £381 million
Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. £471 million +0.50p.p. -£471 million

Management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount, with significant
headroom remaining after performing sensitivity analysis. Details of the Company’s subsidiaries are provided in
Note 17.

There were no unrecognised Company deferred tax assets or liabilities at 31 December 2019 (2018: £nil).

In the Spring Budget 2020, the Government announced that from 1 April 2020 the corporation tax rate
would remain at 19% (rather than reducing to 17%, as previously enacted). This new law was substantively
enacted on 17 March 2020. As the proposal to keep the rate at 19% had not been substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial statements. However, it is likely that the overall
effect of the change, had it been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, would be to increase the tax
expense for the period by £6 million, and to increase the net deferred tax liability to £50 million.

**Restructuring provisions**

Restructuring provisions include the full costs of planned business restructuring programmes, entered into
during the current and prior years.

**Asset retirement provisions**

The Group has certain legal obligations relating to the restoration of leased property to its original condition
at the end of the lease term. This obligation relates principally to the Group’s share of obligation for assets held
in Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited, and to mast sites.

The provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals and the expected
cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but are currently
anticipated to be over the next 17 years.

The provision recognised represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the current statement of financial position date. Such cost estimates, expressed at current price
levels at the date of the estimate are discounted at 31 December 2019 using rates in the range of 1.26% — 1.67%
(2018: 1.33% — 2.05%) per annum. The initial discounted cost amount has been capitalised as part of property,
plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the assets.

**32. Share-based payments**

**Equity-settled share options scheme**

The main share-based payment plans in place during the period are as follows:

**_Telefonica Performance Investment Share Plan 2018-2022_**

The Telefónica, S.A. General Shareholders’ Meeting on 8 June 2018 approved a new instalment of the longterm share-based incentive “Performance and Investment Plan” for certain senior executives and members of the
management team of the Telefonica Group.

The term of the plan is a total of five years divided into three phases, each of a three year duration. The first
cycle was deemed to have started on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the
Plan, employees will be entitled to receive a certain maximum number of shares of Telefónica S.A., upon
fulfillment of certain requirements, namely:

1. The final delivery of shares is conditional upon the employee remaining in the entity’s employ during
the vesting period.

2. The final number of shares granted is subject to certain performance conditions based on:

a. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered upon achievement of a certain Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) target that must be satisfied during the period in which the evolution of the TSR of the
Telefónica Group is measured.

b. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered if a certain free cash flow (“FCF”) target is met.

Thus, if certain performance levels and FCF targets are achieved, the employee is entitled to receive 100%
of the maximum number of shares awarded, whereas if only one of the targets is met, the employee shall receive
the related shares.

468,234 shares were assigned in the first phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked shares
and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

562,558 shares were assigned in the second phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked
shares and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

**_Talent for the future Share Plan (TFSP) 2018-2022_**

The TFSP is a long-term programme aimed to recognise and reward employees with consistent outstanding
performance, with high potential and key skills.

At the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica S.A. held on 8 June 2018, a long-term share-based
incentive plan called “Talent for the Future Share Plan” was approved for certain Telefonica Group employees.

Under this Plan, a certain number of shares of Telefónica S.A. will be delivered to participants selected by
the company who have opted to take part in the scheme and meet the requirements and conditions stipulated to
this end.

The term of the plan is a total of five years divided into three phases, each of a three year duration. The first
cycle was deemed to have started on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the
Plan, employees will be entitled to receive a certain maximum number of shares of Telefónica S.A., upon

the related shares.

53,000 shares were assigned in the first phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked sharess
and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

49,250 shares were assigned in the second phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked
sharess and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

**_Global Employee Share Plan 2019-2021_**

The Global Employee Share Plan 2019 was launched on 20 May 2019. Under the plan employees were
offered the option to acquire Telefónica S.A. shares during a twelve-month period (the acquisition period), with
the company undertaking to deliver a certain number of free shares to participants, subject to certain
requirements.

The total term of the plan is two years. Employees joining the plan could acquire Telefónica S.A. shares
through maximum monthly instalments of €150 (or the local currency equivalent) up to a maximum of €1,800
over a period of 12 months (acquisition period) and the minimum contribution to be made by each participant
would be €25 per month. Those employees who hold the shares for a further twelve months after the end of the
acquisition period, are entitled to receive one free share for every two acquired shares, within the Plan conditions.

The acquisition period commenced in July 2019 and will end in June 2020. The plan’s shareholding period
will come to an end in July 2021. Shares will be delivered in July 2021 at the end of the vesting period.

**33. Retirement benefit schemes**

Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) acted as Sponsor and Principal Employer
of the Plan up to 14 December 2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to transfer the plan into the
Company as the majority of employees participating in the plan are employees of the Company. The transfer was
made via a capital contribution from Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) for
£23.1 million, being the net asset position of the plan on the transfer date.

The Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“the Plan”) comprises the following:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan

F-153

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

The net defined benefit expense and actuarial valuation impacts of the defined benefit scheme, as assessed
in accordance with the advice of a qualified, independent actuary, measuring actuarial liabilities using the
projected unit method and taking assets at market value, are recognised in the statement of total comprehensive
income of Telefonica O2 Holdings Limited (formerly Telefonica Europe plc) up to the date of transfer to
Telefonica UK limited on 14 December 2018.

The Plan provides the pension benefits for the majority of Telefonica’s UK employees, including those of
Telefonica UK Limited. Participating companies whose employees are members are the Plan account for the
defined benefit sections of the plan as though it were a defined contribution plan as there is no contractual
arrangement or stated policy for charging out the net defined benefit cost between participating employers.
Telefonica UK Limited therefore expensed any contributions payable to the defined benefit sections of the plan
for the period up to 14 December 2018.

With effect from 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan was closed to new entrants and
further benefit accrual. The only funding provided into the defined benefit scheme of the Plan after this date has
been the additional deficit funding payments and the section 75 payment. Members’ defined benefit pensions will
continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the Consumer Prices Index but will not retain the link to
any future increases in salary. Upon closure, members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the
option to become members of the defined contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of
the Plan remains open to new entrants and further contributions and the employer contributions are recognised as
part of the staff costs in the participating entities. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Group’s
finances. The trustee of the Plan acts in accordance with its responsibilities under pension regulations and trust
law. They act in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the Plan and operate independently from the
Group.

The liabilities of the UK defined benefit Unfunded plan are recorded within the statement of financial
position of O2 Holdings Limited, as it relates to ex-employees of O2 Holdings Limited. The costs arising from
the Unfunded plan are borne by O2 Holdings Limited, and are reflected on the statement of comprehensive
income of the Company.

The total charge included in the statement of comprehensive income for the Group’s entire pension schemes
are as follows:

**Actuarial valuation**

A full valuation of the defined benefit section of the Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2017 by a
suitably qualified independent actuary. The valuation used the projected unit method.

The initial results of the actuarial valuation of the Plan as at 30 September 2017 have been updated to
31 December 2019 by a third party qualified actuary in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. The defined
benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are stated at fair value.

The Plan’s assets are currently invested in a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked
gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability characteristics. A £25 million contribution was paid to the defined
benefit scheme by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2019 (2018: £nil).

Plan assets are valued by reference to quoted market prices in active markets.

At 31 December 2019, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation of the funded plan
was 22 years (2018: 23 years).

The position and results reported are subject to the accuracy of the assumptions used.

A reduction in the discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A rise in the discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

An increase in the inflation rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A reduction in the inflation rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

There is also uncertainty around the future life expectancy of the UK population. The value of current and
future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.

The following table summarises the estimated sensitivity of the disclosed liability value to changes in the
principal assumptions that have been used in the calculations:

**Charge by assumption** **Liabilities increase by:**
Decrease discount rate by 0.25% £98 million
Increase inflation rate by 0.25% £94 million
Increase life expectancy by 1 year £41 million

**Investment commentary**

As at 31 December 2019, the Plan was fully invested in line with the SIP. The Plan’s assets were invested in
a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability
characteristics. This strategy is achieved through a mixture of direct investments in the target asset classes and
derivatives. This includes the Liability Driven Investment strategy which aims to reduce the Plan’s exposure to
interest rate and inflation risk.

The figures above are as at the statement of financial position date. Market values of Plan’s assets, which
are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant changes before they are realised.
All equity securities and credit opportunities have quoted prices in active markets.

**Risks**

The main risks to which the Group are exposed in relation to the Plan are:

**_Longevity risk_**

The assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from
the Plan and consequently increases in the Plan’s liabilities. The Group and the Plan’s Trustee reviews the
mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.

**_Investment risk_**

The Plan invests its assets in a portfolio of global corporate bonds, liquid credit and synthetic equity, with a
Liability Driven Investment overlay to provide interest and inflation rate hedging. The Plan’s liabilities are
valued with respect to long dated bond yields, so the value of assets and liabilities may move out of line as
investment conditions change. In addition because the duration of the Plan’s assets is shorter than the duration of
the Plan’s liabilities, there is a risk that the Trustee will not be able to reinvest the Plan’s assets at assumed rates.
The Plan’s Trustee reviews the structure of the investment portfolio on a regular basis to minimise these risks.

**_Yield risk_**

A fall in bond yields will increase both the value of the Plan’s assets and liabilities. At present the value of
the Plan’s liabilities is greater than the value of its assets, and as a result there is a risk that the value of the
liabilities may grow in monetary terms by more than the value of the Plan’s assets, increasing the deficit in the
Plan.

**_Inflation risk_**

The majority of the Plan’s liabilities increase in line with inflation and so if inflation is greater than
expected, the liabilities will increase. The Plan has hedged some of the inflation risk and will continue to monitor
this risk.

**Other pension plans**

The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme in the UK. The assets of these defined contribution
arrangements are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The expense, in
the statement of comprehensive income, relating to the defined contribution section of the Plan is equal to the
contributions paid over the period presented, which totaled £38 million for the year ended 31 December 2019
(2018: £35 million).

**34. Financial instruments and capital management**

**34.1 Financial risk factors and management**

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and trade
and other payables. The purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and short term deposits.

The main sources of risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are currency risk, interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk. Management of the Group’s financial risks is achieved mostly through being a part
of the larger Telefónica Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in each area and is able to hedge
positions on a Group basis.

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. No detailed sensitivity analysis is presented, as the Group considers that its risk exposure has been
appropriately mitigated. The principal financial risks of the Group and how the Group manages these risks are
discussed below.

**(a)** **Market risk**

**(i)** **Foreign currency risk**

The Group operates mainly in the United Kingdom. The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange
risks arising from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the Euro and US dollar that can affect
its results and financial position. The impact of any reasonable change in foreign exchange rates would not have
a significant impact on the result of the Group for the year.

The Group also has a small amount of transactional exposure. Such exposure arises from revenues and
purchases by an operating unit that is in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Significant
exposures are managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and the Telefónica Group managing
positions on a Telefónica Group wide basis.

**(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

F-158


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the effects of movements in interest rates on the value of
the Group’s long-term borrowings and interest received on cash and cash equivalents. The Group’s long term
borrowings and other financial assets are at fixed interest rates. The majority of the Group’s cash and cash
equivalents are deposited with a central Telefonica Group company that pays interest at variable market rates.

The impact of any reasonable change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the result of
the Group for the year.

**Effective interest rates and re-pricing analysis**

In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table
indicates the periods in which they re-price or mature (whichever date is earlier). Their effective interest rates at
the statement of financial position date are disclosed in Note 23. Accrued interest has been included in the
analysis.

**(b) Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

The Group’s principal credit risks are attributable to its trade receivables and contract assets. Trade
receivables and contract assets as presented in the statement of financial position are net of provisions for
estimated credit losses.

At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counter-parties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. The Group does
not require collateral in respect of financial assets.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**(i)** **Trade receivables and contract assets**

The Group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The Group expects that
some debts due will not be paid as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The expected credit
loss rates are based on historical results and future expectations, the economic and competitive environment and
other relevant factors to determine the provision for credit losses. A significant, unanticipated downturn in the
major economies that the Group operates in or negative industry trends could require an increase in the estimated
level of debts that will not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. The exposure to
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. The contract assets relate to unbilled
revenue and have substantially the same characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.

The loss allowance was determined for trade receivables and contract assets at 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018 as follows:

**Contract assets** **Trade receivables**
**31 December** **31 December** **31 December** **31 December**

For the receivables which are not impaired and which are overdue at the reporting date, there has been no
indication that their payment obligations will not be met.

Trade receivables and contract assets are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within
operating profit in the statement of comprehensive income. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written
off are credited against the same line item.

**(c)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with
financial liabilities.

F-160

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

Management of the Group’s liquidity risk is achieved mostly through being a part of the larger Telefónica
Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in this area. The Group holds financial assets primarily in
short-term deposits with a central Telefónica Group company that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash. These measures help keep liquidity risk low.

The following tables set out contractual undiscounted cash outflows of financial liabilities, including interest
payments:

**Supplier financing arrangements**

The Group operates a supplier financing scheme for certain suppliers that allows them to be paid earlier than
the invoice due date. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the
payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; these
indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. The balances
contained within trade payables amounted to £342 million at 31 December 2019 (2018: £302 million). As at

F-161

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

31 December 2019 none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be
reclassified as borrowings.

**34.2 Capital management**

The Group’s capital comprises share capital, a capital reserve (see Note 29) and retained earnings.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue to operate as
a going concern, to maintain optimal capital structure commensurate with risk and return and to reduce the cost
of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay dividends to its shareholder, return
capital to its shareholder, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt or draw down more debt.

The Group’s total capital and gearing is as follows:

For the years ended 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 there are no financial assets classified as:
fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option; fair value through other comprehensive income (debt
or equity instruments); or hedges.

All financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are classified as level 2 in the measurement
hierarchy and are measured using other directly observable market inputs. There are no financial assets classified
as level 1 (quoted prices) or level 3 (inputs not based on observable market data).

Details of receivables and payables to and from the immediate parent company of the Group are contained
in Notes 21 and 26.

Included within cash equivalents at 31 December 2019 is £315 million (2018: £305 million) of funds
deposited with Telfisa Global B.V., a related party, which are repayable on demand.

Related party transactions with Directors and key management are detailed in Note 8.

**36. Contingent Liabilities**

**_Phones 4u_**

Legal proceedings have been issued in the High Court against the Group by the Administrators of Phones
4u. The Group has vigorously denied the allegations and filed its defence to this claim in April 2019. No
provision has been made in relation to this matter.

**37. Other matters**

As disclosed in previous years the Group has been addressing a request for disclosure made by
governmental authorities which is related to possible violations of anti-bribery laws and regulations. The Group
continues to co-operate with the governmental authorities investigating this matter which is still ongoing. Also
the Group continues to conduct its own internal investigation on the matter. Whilst it is not possible at this time
to predict the full scope or duration of this matter or its eventual outcome, the Group considers it can make a
reliable estimate of the outcome and has made an accrual for this amount at 31 December 2019 (31 December
2018 : no accrual was made).

Disclosure of the matters required by IAS 37 has not been provided as permitted by IAS37 para 92 as the
directors believe that further disclosure will be seriously prejudicial to future developments on this matter.

**38. Subsequent events**

**_Annual Licence Fees_**

In 2015, by way of regulations (2015 Regulations), Ofcom reset the existing regulations (2011 Regulations)
for Annual Licence Fees (ALFs) for the 900 & 1800 MHz bands from approximately £65m to £200m per annum
for all mobile network operators (MNOs). Telefonica UK’s fees were set at £49.8m pa. The 2015 Regulations

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

were quashed in 2017 pursuant to a Court of Appeal judgment which held that they had been determined
unlawfully by Ofcom. The fees regime reverted to the pre-existing 2011 Regulations and the lower fees set in
these Regulations. O2 and the other MNOs brought a claim against Ofcom for repayment of the difference
between the amounts paid under the unlawful 2015 Regulations and the lawful 2011 Regulations. O2’s claim was
initially £52.8m plus interest. This figure increased to £54.4m plus interest in 2019 due to a payment being
incorrectly characterised when the claim was first formulated.

Ofcom disputed that the MNOs were entitled to claim the difference in this way, instead asserting that the
MNOs were only entitled to the difference between the amount paid under the unlawful 2015 Regulations and a
notional amount that would have been paid had Ofcom put in place lawful regulations at the relevant time (which
Ofcom noted would have been of a similar level to the 2015 Regulation fees based on a new consultation and
subsequent 2018 Regulations that came into force which set ALFs at a broadly similar level as they had been set
by the 2015 Regulations). The MNOs won their claim in the High Court in 2019 and the appeal in the Court of
Appeal in 2020. Ofcom is not appealing the Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court.

**_O2 and Virgin Media Joint Venture_**

On 7 May 2020, Telefonica SA and Liberty Global announced that both companies had entered into an
agreement together to create a 50:50 joint venture in the UK, bringing together the Telefonica UK (O2) and
Virgin Media businesses. The arrangement is still subject to regulatory clearance has been agreed in order to
create a national connectivity champion capable of competing at the highest level with the combined mobile and
home connections. It is anticipated that closing of the transaction, subject to regulatory clearance is expected to
take place around the middle of 2021.

**_Covid-19_**

Worldwide or national health-related events, including the outbreak of contagious diseases, epidemics or
pandemics, such as COVID-19 (coronavirus), could significantly affect our operations. Such events could cause,
among others, delays in the supply chain due to problems in factories or logistic services; impact on employees
or third parties due to quarantine periods or infection, and also affecting global and therefore national economic
growth. The latter stemming from a variety of adverse impacts on supply (paralysis of integrated production
chains, freezing of productive resources) and demand (deterioration of confidence and expectations, negative
income and wealth effects) caused by a substantial deterioration in financial markets, unprecedented falls in
commodity prices, sharp slowdown in commercial activity or heavy restrictions on transport. Like every other
business we are not immune to the consequences of the pandemic and are committed to ensuring that the
Business can navigate through the unprecedented uncertain times, supporting our customers and employees as
well as contributing to the recovery of the economy which we operate in by keeping Britain connected. As
Britain works through this national crisis, mobile is playing a more critical role than ever to keep people
connected. We are doubling some elements of our network capacity, enabling essential connectivity, supporting
Britain’s productivity and donating directly to those who need it—all in the pursuit of keeping Britain connected.

As a responsible business we followed government advice to help protect our people and our customers. We
implemented our business continuity plans to allow office-based employees to work from home and took a
decision to close our stores after trading on 23 March 2020 ahead of the national lockdown announcement by the
government. During the lockdown period we implemented a work from home policy where it is possible to do so
ensuring the safety and welfare of our people and the ability to continue to meet the needs of our customers. In
addition, we brought in a range of temporary people measures, including the protection of base pay for all
employees including paid leave for vulnerable employees and for those in self-isolation, or with caring
responsibilities who are unable to work from home, including retail employees. We worked closely with the
government to provide assistance to NHS workers, charities and our customers by providing 25% discount on
tariffs and free data for NHS workers, unlimited free calls for Pay Monthly customers, suspended roaming
charges, support for vulnerable customers and zero-rating access to support and charity websites. We were
instrumental to supporting the NHS and keeping Britain connected by providing connectivity to the Nightingale
hospitals across the country and donated The O2 as a training facility as well as a drive through testing facility
for the NHS. We also partnered with the BBC’s Big Night In to galvanize the nation to respond to the challenges
that lie ahead.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

Following the ease of the lockdown restrictions in phases we are committed to ensuring the continuing
safety of our employees and customers and have re-engineered our retail estate, practices and procedures to align
with the government guidelines for social distancing. We are mindful of the economic pressure and impact on
our profitability growth and are committed to helping Britain get back to normal by supporting our customers
and businesses.

The Group has shown resilience throughout this turbulent period and the need for connectivity by our
customers has been just as strong, albeit their specific demands have changed. The below table outlines the main
impacts to the business as a result of COVID-19 and what the business has done to address them.

**Matter to**
**consider** **Impacts/Risks** **Mitigations** **Conclusion**


Revenue Store closures have resulted
in a slow down of hardware
revenue.

Smart metering revenues
have slowed down due to
physical restrictions during
lockdown.

The travel ban in the UK and
across many parts of Europe
has resulted in reduced
roaming revenues.

Liquidity Financing becomes more
expensive and unavailable in
the current climate.

Collections Customers struggle to pay
their bills and increased bad
debt.


Improved online sales
capabilities by enabling
telesales teams to operate
from home and adapting
physical estate in order to
manage the sales process
under social distancing
guidelines.

Key debt facility has been
renewed for an additional
term and the introduction of a
new funding partner has
enabled the Company to
grow the facility whilst
keeping the total cost of
funding the facility flat.

Following emergency
changes to government
regulations on Consumer
Credit Agreements we
initially introduced an
emergency payment option
for any customers finding it
difficult to pay their bill as a
direct result of COVID-19.

Appropriate provisions have
been made for the anticipated
increase in bad debt as a
result of the pandemic.


We have seen an increase in
online channel sales and we
expect other channels to pick
up again as lockdown
restrictions start to ease from
mid-June.

The reduction in roaming
revenues is partially offset by
a reduction in associated
costs.

No significant liquidity
concerns, the risk of a loss of
available funding has been
mitigated through the
introduction of a third
funding partner.

The volumes of customers
taking the emergency
payment option has been
within expected levels, the
impact has been considered
in forward looking financial
forecasts.

Appropriate measures are
now in place to review cost
control and capital
expenditure in light of the
pandemic.


Costs/Capital Spend is not reviewed in light The board has reviewed
allocation of COVID-19. discretionary expenditure and
investments in view of
COVID-19 and continue to
execute smart spending
principles to focus on core
service and targeted cost
management throughout the
business.

Forecasting Forecasts are not reflective of
performance during
COVID-19 crisis.

Network Network overload and
Resilience possible degradation of
services from the growth of
voice / data traffic.

**_Disposal of legacy assets_**


We have processes in place
to review the appropriateness
of our financial outlooks
regularly and monitor market
activity on an ongoing basis.
Rate and volume assumptions
have been stress tested and
triangulated with market
insight and trading updates.

We proactively managed the
expected voice traffic increase
through increased network
capacity. Data usage patterns
changed as people connected
from their homes rather than
work locations and commuting
routes with no negative impact
on the network.


Current forecasts take
account of risks associated
with trading during the
COVID-19 crisis.

Network capacity planning
reflects an expected impact
of changes in future usage
patterns as a result of
COVID-19.


During the year ended 31 December 2019 amounts of £1,418 million cost and £1,418 million accumulated
depreciation were disposed of relating to legacy assets no longer in use. Subsequent to 31 December 2019 we
identified further legacy assets no longer in use of £85 million cost and £85 million accumulated depreciation.
Consequently we disposed of a total of £1,503 million cost and £1,503 million accumulated depreciation during
the year ended 31 December 2019. The disposals had £Nil impact on the net book amount of property, plant and
equipment.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

**1.** **General information**

O2 Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries and investees (“O2 Holdings”, “the Company”, the “O2 Group” or
“the Group”) is a private company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies
Act 2006 and is registered in England and Wales under the number 02604354. The address of the Company’s
registered office is 260 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire SL1 4DX. The principal activity of the Group is the
operation of a cellular communications network using spectrum held under licences granted in 1994, 2001, 2013
and 2018 to provide mobile communications services to its customers under the “O2” and “giffgaff” brands.

Telefónica, S.A. and its subsidiaries and investees (“Telefónica Group”), is the ultimate parent company of
the Group and is a public limited company incorporated on April 19, 1924. Its registered office is at Gran Via 28,
Madrid, Spain.

The functional currency of O2 Holdings Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. The consolidated financial
statements are also presented in pounds sterling.

**2.** **Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2018:

**_IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers_**

IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue from contracts with customers. The Group has
adopted IFRS 15 using one of the two transition methods allowed: the modified retrospective method, with the
cumulative effect from initial application recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
at the date of initial application, 1 January 2018. Accordingly, the 2017 information presented for comparative
purposes has not been restated i.e. it is prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting standards
effective during that period: under IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations.

Under the provisions in IFRS 15, it is possible to elect to apply certain practical expedients to reduce
complexity in the application of the new requirements. The main practical expedients applied by the Group are:

    - Completed contracts: not to apply the standard retrospectively to contracts that were completed at
1 January 2018.

    - Portfolio approach: the Group has applied the requirements of the standard to groups of contracts with
similar characteristics (individual consumer customers and small and medium-sized entities, where
standard offers are marketed), since, for the clusters identified, the effects do not differ significantly
from an application on a contract by contract basis.

The details of the new significant accounting policies and the nature of the main changes to previous
accounting policies in relation to revenue recognition under the new model in IFRS 15 are set out in Note 3. The
most significant impacts relate to the first-time recognition of contract assets that, under IFRS 15, lead to the
earlier recognition of revenue from the sale of handsets; and the deferral of the incremental costs of obtaining
postpay contracts, that under IFRS 15, result in the later recognition of customer acquisition costs.

(a) The decrease in revenue is driven by a netting of hardware credits between revenue and operating costs and
certain expenses considered as a reduction in a revenue transaction price under IFRS 15. This is offset by
an increase in revenue due to earlier recognition of handset revenues.

(b) The reduction in operating costs is driven by a netting of hardware credits between revenue and operating
costs and certain expenses considered as a reduction in a revenue transaction price under IFRS 15.

(d) The decrease in current trade and other payables and increase in non-current trade and other payables is
primarily driven by a decrease in deferred income due to changes in timing of revenue recognition under
IFRS 15, offset by the creation of contractual liabilities related to unperformed contractual obligations
where consideration has been received.

**_IFRS 9 Financial Instruments_**

IFRS 9 sets out a new accounting framework for the recognition, classification, measurement and
derecognition of financial instruments, impairment losses on financial assets and hedge accounting. The details
of the new significant accounting policies and the nature of the main changes to previous accounting policies in
relation to financial instruments under the new standard IFRS 9 are set out in Note 3.

Pursuant to the transition provisions in IFRS 9, the Group has elected to use the exemption not to restate
comparative periods to be presented in the year of initial application i.e. 2017 information presented for
comparative purposes is prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting standards effective during that
period: under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and related interpretations. The
difference in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of the
new requirements is recognised in retained earnings at 1 January 2018.

The main impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2018 resulted in an increase of £36 million over the bad debt provision and fair value adjustments on trade
receivables. In addition to this, financial assets have changed to the new measurement categories under IFRS 9
which has resulted in some receivables being reclassified to current receivables held to sell from non-current
receivables (see Note 31.3).

- The additional tax payments required as a result of initial application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 were paid in 4
instalments, with the final payment made in April 2019.

**2.2 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
31 December 2018 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of
the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.

**_IFRS 16 Leases — effective 1 January 2019_**

Adoption of IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised in the statement of financial position,
since the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (that is,
the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. A lessee may elect not to
apply the general requirements to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

The Group acts as a lessee on a large number of lease agreements. These include leases of third party mobile
masts (towers), circuits, office buildings and stores and land where towers are located. These contracts are
generally accounted for as operating leases under the current lease standard, with lease payments being
recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement over the contract term.

The Group’s project to implement the new requirements is complex. A large number of contracts are
affected and data must be collected from a wide range of sources. Certain estimates are also necessary, including
the estimation of the lease term. The lease term is based on the non-cancellable period; plus periods covered by
options to extend the lease, where such options depend only on the Group and where exercise is assessed to be
reasonably certain, taking into account the specific situation of the lease. In addition certain assumptions have
been required to calculate the discount rate, based principally on the incremental borrowing rate of interest
required to finance the expected payments during the lease term. The Group has also elected not to recognise
non-lease components separately from lease components for those classes of assets in which non-lease
components are not significant with respect to the total value of arrangement.

The standard allows for two transition methods: retrospectively for all periods presented, or using a
modified retrospective approach. The Group shall adopt the modified retrospective transition method,
recognising the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to retained earnings in the year of initial
application of IFRS 16.

Certain practical expedients are also available on first time application. The Group will apply the practical
expedient that allows the Group to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease on the date of initial
application of IFRS 16. The new requirement will therefore be applied to all contracts previously identified as
leases under the current accounting standard.

F-180


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

In addition, the following practical expedients will also be adopted by the Group on transition to the new
requirements:

    - Right of use asset measurement: for a vast majority of leases previously classified as an operating lease
the Group shall recognise a right of use asset at the date of initial application measured at an amount
equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to
that lease recognised in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial
application.

    - Discount rates: a lessee may apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar
characteristics such as lease term, class of underlying asset, currency and economic environment.

    - Initial direct costs: the Group will exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right of use
asset at the date of initial application.

The Group expects that the changes introduced by IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on its financial
statements from the date of adoption. Based on the assessment performed to date, the Group expects that the
opening balance sheet at the date of initial application will show an increase in assets and liabilities of
£707 million in connection with the rights of use and payment obligations arising from the majority of contracts
that are classified as operating leases under the current lease standard. The impact expected in equity is not
significant at 1 January 2019. Amortisation of the right of use assets and recognition of interest costs on the lease
obligation on the statement of comprehensive income will replace amounts recognised as lease expenses under
the current lease standard, thus increasing operating income before depreciation and amortisation. Classification
of lease payments in the statement of cash flows will be effected by the requirements of the new lease standard: a
significant portion of the lease payments recognised as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of
cash flows under the current lease standard, will be classified as cash flows from financing activities upon
application of the new lease accounting requirements.

The Group estimates that the main differences between the lease commitments disclosed in Note 28 and the
new lease liability measurement will relate mainly to:

    - Differences relating to the contract population considered: lease liabilities do not include short-term
leases or leases of low-value of intangible assets, while those are included in the expected payment
schedule. Payments relating to contracts that can be cancelled without penalty are not included within
lease payment commitment, but they are included in the lease liability.

    - Differences in the lease term: extension options that are reasonably certain are part of the measurement
of the lease liability, whereas they are not taken into consideration in the estimated payments schedule
for operating leases.

    - Discount rate differences: to the extent that there are differences in lease terms, the discount rates used
are different as a consequence.

Estimated adoption impacts are based on the assessment conducted to date. Actual impacts at 1 January
2019 could be different because the Group is continuing to review the impacts of the initial application of the
new requirements due to the estimations required, the high number of contracts affected and testing of new
systems used in the implementation project. The new accounting policies will not be final until the Group
presents its first financial statements subsequent to the effective date of IFRS 16.

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

**3.1 Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations,
as adopted for use in the EU. In addition the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have
been prepared using historical cost principles.

F-181

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The principal accounting policies of the Group applied in the preparation of these financial statements are
set out below. The IFRS accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented.

The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to
present an individual Company statement of comprehensive income.

The Directors have reviewed the business plan for the period to 31 December 2021, and together with the
commitment received from the ultimate parent company to continue providing financial support and on this basis
have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
annual financial statements.

**3.2 Presentation of financial information**

Operating items in the statement of comprehensive income are derived from the primary operations of the
Group as a telecommunications provider. Items in the statement of comprehensive income recognised below
operating profit represent activities that are not directly attributable to the Company’s primary operations.

**3.3 Basis of group accounting**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and
its share of jointly controlled entities as at 31 December 2018.

**_Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the
Group has:

    - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

    - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

    - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting right result in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group
considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

    - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

    - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or

    - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there
are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control of the
subsidiary.

The financial statements of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date when control commences until control ceases. All principal subsidiary undertakings’ financial years are
co-terminus with those of O2 Holdings Limited.

IFRS 11 establishes principles for the financial reporting of parties to joint arrangements. It defines joint
control as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements that
meet the definition of a joint venture are accounted for using the equity method, while joint arrangements that
meet the definition of joint operations are accounted for by integrating assets and liabilities, and the related
revenues and expenses, in proportion to the joint operator’s interest in the arrangement.

Upon adoption of IFRS 11 in 2014, the Group determined its interests in Cornerstone Telecommunications
Infrastructure Limited, which is engaged in maintaining and managing the non-radio (passive) assets supporting
the mobile wireless network of Vodafone Limited and Telefonica UK Limited, and in Digital Mobile Spectrum
Limited, which is engaged in the provision of services in relation to spectrum auction obligations, to be classified
as joint operations. These are accounted for as joint operations by recognising the assets and liabilities and the
related revenues, expenses and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and
participation in the joint operations.

Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The
carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group´s share of net assets of the
associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. The statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group’s
share of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Note 18 includes details of the Group’s joint
ventures.

**3.5 Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**3.6 Foreign currencies**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial
statements.

In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, the monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates prevailing at each
reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary
items, are included in the profit of loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of
non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss of the period except for differences arising
on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing
exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates for the
period. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used at the period end date, if
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

**3.7 Revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group adopted the following IFRS 15 revenue accounting policies from 1 January 2018.

F-183

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

Revenue, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises mobile service revenue and
hardware and other revenue (each as described in more detail below).

Mobile service revenue includes revenue earned for usage of the Group’s wireless network for voice, text
message and data transmission by the Group’s customers, subscription fees (including those earned from the
Group’s MVNO partners), inbound roaming (earned from foreign mobile operators whose customers roam onto
the Group’s network), outbound roaming (earned from the Group’s customers roaming outside their domestic
coverage area) and interconnect revenue (earned from other telecommunication operators whose customers
terminate calls on the Group’s network).

Hardware revenue principally consists of revenue from the sale of mobile devices, including smartphones
and other mobile handsets sold through the Group’s direct distribution channels under the Refresh proposition,
where hardware is recognised as a separate performance obligation, as well as the sale of tablets, smart-tech (e.g.
smart watches and fitness devices) and accessories (e.g. mobile phone cases, screen protectors, chargers, cables,
portable batteries, headphones and speakers). Hardware revenue is recognised when the products are delivered to
the customer.

Other revenue principally consists of revenue from the Group’s integrated mobile, Wi-Fi and fixed-line
offerings to business customers and related business offerings and insurance sales. These revenues are recognised
on the provision of both goods and services, with revenue recognition on delivery of each separate performance
obligation.

Under IFRS 15, for bundled packages that combine mobile service, hardware and other revenue, the total
revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on their standalone selling prices in relation to the total
consideration of the package and is recognised when (or as) the obligation is satisfied, regardless of whether
there are undelivered items. This differs from previous accounting where the portion of the total consideration
that was contingent upon delivery of undelivered elements was not allocated to delivered elements.
Consequently, when bundles include a discount on equipment, the adoption of these new requirements results in
an increase of revenues recognised from the sale of handsets and other equipment, generally recognised upon
delivery to the end customer, offset by a reduction of ongoing service revenue over subsequent periods. To the
extent that the packages are marketed at a discount, the difference between the revenue from the sale of
equipment and the consideration received from the customer upfront is recognised as a contract asset on the
statement of financial position.

IFRS 15 requires the recognition of an asset for those incremental costs (sales commissions and other third
party acquisition costs) directly related to obtaining a contract and that are expected to be recovered. These are
subsequently amortised over the same period as the revenue associated with such asset. Costs to obtain a contract
are expensed when incurred if the Group estimates that their amortisation period is one year or less.

Information on the impact of initial application this standard is disclosed in Note 2.

**3.8 Operating costs**

Operating costs principally include costs of acquiring, retaining and servicing customers, network and
non-network accommodation costs in relation to the Group’s properties, network maintenance costs, IT and
system support costs, marketing costs and bad debt expenses. Marketing costs comprising advertising,
promotion, sponsorship and communication are also expensed as incurred.

**3.9 Staff costs**

Staff costs comprise wages and salaries and related direct employment costs for permanent employees.

**3.10 Employee benefits**

**Retirement benefit obligations**

Telefonica Europe plc, immediate parent company of O2 Holdings Limited, operates both defined benefit
and defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that sets the amount of pension benefit

F-184


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of
service and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed
contributions on behalf of employees and under which there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
contributions for employees’ service in the current and prior periods.

The Company participates in the Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“Plan”), which provides benefits for the
majority of UK employees in the Telefonica Europe plc Group. During the period presented, the Plan had the
following defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:

    - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan;

    - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan; and

    - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan.

On 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan closed to further benefit accrual. Member
benefits of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan will continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the
Consumer Prices Index (see Note 30), but will not retain the link to any future increases in salary. Upon closure,
members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the option to become members of the defined
contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of the Plan remains open to new entrants and
further accrual. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Company’s finances.

In its capacity as a participating employer in the defined contribution scheme of the Plan, the Group pays
contributions into the Plan on behalf of the employees. The Group has no further obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in the future payments is available.

Telefonica Europe plc (the Company’s ultimate UK parent company) acted as Sponsor and Principal
Employer of the Plan up to 14 December 2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to transfer the plan
into the Company as the majority of employees participating in the plan are employees of the Company. The
transfer was made via a capital contribution from Telefonica Europe plc for £23.1 million, being the net asset
position of the plan on the transfer date. The corresponding net asset is recorded on the statement of financial
position of Group. The Company recognises only the unfunded defined benefit liability on its statement of
financial position, as the unfunded scheme is exclusively related to the Company.

The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension
plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair
value of the plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the
related pension liability.

Accordingly all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and
expense in the period in which they arise.

**Share-based payments**

The Group recognises an expense for share awards and share options, which are equity settled, based on the
fair value of the share awards or share options granted as compensation for the services rendered by employees.
The fair value is calculated at the grant date using an adjusted statistical model and excludes the impact of
non-market conditions. Instead, the expense is adjusted for the effect of non-market conditions at each reporting
date through the number of share awards or share options expected to be exercisable.

F-185


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The effect of market and non-vesting conditions is included in the fair value at the date of grant and is
recognised as an expense in employee costs irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied. Telefónica S.A. recharges the Group for the cost of share schemes and therefore the share-based
transaction is not settled in the Group’s equity instruments.

**3.11 Financial income and expense**

Financial income principally consists of interest income on Group deposits and gains arising from foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments. Financial expense principally consists of interest expense on Group
borrowings and losses arising from foreign exchange rate hedging instruments. The Group utilises foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate exposure principally in respect of Euro and
US dollar payments with regard to roaming agreements and not for speculative purposes.

**3.12 Taxation**

The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are
non-assessable or disallowed.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the statement of financial position liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable future taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax and current tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the
deferred income tax liability is settled.

Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity is also recognised
directly in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

**3.13 Dividends**

Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in
the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s Board. Income is recognised when the company’s
rights to receive the payment is established. Dividends received from subsidiary companies are recognised as
finance income in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are received.

**3.14 Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and
equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment from the date they are available for use over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

F-186


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The lives assigned to property, plant and equipment are:

**Land and buildings**
Freehold Buildings 40 years
Leasehold buildings Unexpired portion of lease or 40 years whichever is the shorter

**Plant and equipment**
Network assets 5 to 20 years
Computers and office equipment 2 to 5 years

The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of
financial position date. No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount
of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.

Property, plant and equipment not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be
depreciated. Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of property, plant
and equipment and will be depreciated in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.15 Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiaries, represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the
date of acquisition.

After initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is
recognised as an asset denominated in the currency of the Group acquired and is tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently if there are certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may
not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit (or group of cash generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition
date.

**_Radiocommunications Licences_**

Licence fees paid to the Government, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined
periods, are capitalised at cost less impairment losses and are amortised from the date of commercial launch of
the service over the initial 20 year term of the licence on a straight line basis. The remaining useful lives of the
licences are as follows:

**Licence** **Remaining useful life**

3G — 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz 3 years
4G — 800 MHz 14 years
4G — 2.3 GHz 19 years
5G — 3.4 GHz 19 years — not commenced amortisation

The 5G spectrum is classified as an asset in the course of construction as it was not in use on 31 December
2018.

**_Software_**

Software is capitalised and measured at the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software of between 2 and 6 years on a straight

F-187


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

line basis. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable unique software products
controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits over a period of more than one year,
are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as intangible assets are
amortised over the estimated useful lives of the software not exceeding 6 years on a straight line basis.

Intangible assets not in use are classified as assets in the course of construction and will not be amortised.
Once they are available for use they will be reclassified to the relevant category of intangible assets and will be
amortised in line with the above accounting policy.

**3.16 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets with a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (“cash-generating units”).

**3.17 Investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

**3.18 Inventories**

Inventories comprise mainly handsets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a
first-in, first-out basis, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost comprises costs of purchase and costs incurred in
bringing inventory to its current location and condition.

**3.19 Financial assets**

_(i)_ _Classification_

From 1 January 2018, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

    - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through
profit or loss); and

    - those to be measured at amortised cost.

_(ii)_ _Recognition and derecognition_

Financial assets are recognised on the date the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

Trade receivables that are sold without recourse are derecognised at the point they are factored. Any fee
incurred to effect factoring is netted against cash received and expensed in the income statement.

_(iii)_ _Measurement_

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or
loss.

F-188

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

_(iv)_ _Impairment_

From 1 January 2018, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated
with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk.

**3.20 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. Cash and cash
equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less, and short term deposits repayable on demand with Telefónica
Finanzas S.A and Telfisa Global B.V., both of which are related parties. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

**3.21 Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between the cost and the redemption value being recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. Accrued interest on
borrowings is included within the carrying value.

**3.22 Trade and other payables**

Trade payables and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in
the ordinary course of business from suppliers. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer). If not, they are presented as
non-current liabilities.

Trade payables and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**3.23 Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used,
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Restructuring provisions could comprise, amongst other items, employee termination payments, and these
are recognised in the period in which the Group becomes legally or constructively committed to payment. A
provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition of the site.

**3.24 Leases**

Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive
income in equal annual instalments over the periods of the leases.

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the present value of the minimum
lease payments and the fair value of the asset at the inception of the leases and depreciated over the estimated
useful economic lives of the assets. Finance charges are allocated over the period of the leases in proportion to
the capital amount outstanding and are charged as a financial expense to the statement of comprehensive income.

The Group will adopt IFRS 16 lease accounting policies detailed in note 2 from 1 January 2019.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements
(other than those involving estimations) in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and a significant change in the facts and circumstances on which these estimates are based could have a
material impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or
in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**_Significant accounting judgements_**

**_Joint arrangements_**

The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with
one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either
a joint operation or as a joint venture which depends on management’s assessment of the legal form and
substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners
have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.

The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group accounts
for their interest in their joint operation by recognising the assets and liabilities and the related revenues,
expenses and share of commitments in proportion to the Group’s contribution to and participation in the joint
operation, whereas the Group’s investment and share of results of joint ventures are accounted for under the
equity method where the share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively.

**_Key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting
period that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are discussed below.

**4.1 Property, plant and equipment and licences**

Accounting for property, plant and equipment and licences involves the use of estimates and judgements for
determining the useful lives over which they are to be depreciated or amortised and the existence and amount of
any impairment.

Property, plant and equipment and licences are depreciated or amortised on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful lives and taking into account their expected residual values. When the Group estimates useful
lives various factors are considered including expected technological obsolescence and the expected usage of the
asset. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect the estimated
current remaining lives in light of technological changes, future economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned. A significant change in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation and
amortisation charges for the period.

It is not practicable to quantify the impact of changes in property, plant and equipment asset lives on an
overall basis as asset lives are individually determined and there is a significant number of assets in use. The
impact of any change would vary significantly depending on the individual changes in assets and the classes of
assets impacted.

F-190


-----

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The Group assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and licences whenever there is reason
to believe that the carrying value may not exceed the fair value and where a permanent impairment in value is
anticipated. The determination of whether the impairment of these assets is necessary involves the use of
estimates that includes, but is not limited to, the analysis of the cause of potential impairment in value, the timing
of such potential impairment and an estimate of the amount of the impairment.

The Group considers technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other changes in
circumstances as indications of the need to perform an impairment test. A significant change in the facts and
circumstances that were relied upon in making the estimates may trigger the requirement for recording
impairment and may have a material adverse impact on the operating results and financial condition of the
Group. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and licences for each reporting period is set out in
Notes 13 and 14 respectively.

**4.2 Goodwill impairment**

Goodwill is not subject to a regular amortisation charge and is instead tested annually to determine whether
any impairment has arisen. This is completed by calculating the recoverable amount of cash-generating units
(“CGUs”) based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates and judgements to
calculate expected cash flows. Management make assumptions including, but not limited to, the discount rate to
be applied, future technological evolution and revenue growth rates in calculating expected cash flow. A
significant change in these facts and circumstances may have a material impact on the carrying value of
goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill for each reporting period is set out in Note 15.

**4.3 Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
of the amount can be made. This obligation may be legal or constructive deriving from regulations, contracts,
normal practices or public commitments that lead third parties to reasonably expect that the Group will assume
certain responsibilities. The amount of the provision is determined based on the best estimate of the outflow of
resources required to settle the obligation, taking into account all available information.

Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of provision, actual outflows
of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the basis of the estimates.

The asset retirement provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals
and the expected cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but
are currently anticipated to be over the next 21 years.

The carrying amount of provisions for each reporting period is set out in Note 24.

**4.4 Pension benefits**

The cost of the defined benefit pension plan and the present value of the pension obligation are determined
using an actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the
discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the
valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds
with at least an AA rating, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined
benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publically available mortality tables. Future salary increases and
pension increases are based in expected future inflation rates.

Further details about the assumptions are given in note 30.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

**4.5 Impairment of investments**

An impairment exists when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted
cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from forecasts. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the
discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected cash inflows and the growth rate
used for extrapolation purposes.

**4.6 Smart Metering**

The Smart Metering implementation program is a program running until 2028. Revenue recognition is
dependent upon the timing of services and equipment delivery which may vary over the pre-determined roll-out
period.

**5.** **Operating segments**

As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the Group had only one reportable segment, which is the
mobile telecommunications business in the UK.

The mobile telecommunications segment derives revenue from the operation of a cellular communications
network, and the sale of mobile and data services to the Group’s customer base.

**6.** **Revenue and operating profit**

The total revenue for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 was £6,007 million (2017: £5,729
million). An analysis of the Group’s revenue by stream is set out below:

The licences are assets permitting the Group to operate both its “3G” and “4G” networks in the UK.

During the year the Group secured 80 MHz of spectrum in an Ofcom auction, at a cost of
£523.6 million. This included 40MHz of immediately useable (2.3GHz) spectrum, which was all of the spectrum
available in this band, as well as 40MHz of 3.4 GHz spectrum, earmarked for 5G. The 2.3GHz spectrum was
reclassified from assets in the course of construction to licenses during the year ended 31 December 2018. The
3.4GHz spectrum is categorised as an asset in the course of construction and is not amortised.

The Group is expecting to utilise the 40 MHz ‘slice’ of 5G-ready 3.4 GHz spectrum during 2019.

During the year ended 31 December 2018 a transfer was made from property, plant and equipment to
intangible assets amounting to £59 million to better present certain assets. Additional amortisation of £29 million
was charged in the year relating to the population of assets affected to record amortisation at the rate appropriate
for the assets.

**Impairment testing**

Goodwill arises in relation to the Telefonica UK cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being Telefonica UK
Limited.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are certain events or changes
indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The potential impairment loss is
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units)
to which the goodwill is allocated from the acquisition date. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying
amount, an irreversible impairment loss is recognised.

The Group evaluates its cash-generating unit performance regularly to identify potential goodwill
impairments. The strategic plan of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated has been used to perform the
impairment test at year-end. The process of preparing the CGU strategic plan takes into consideration the current
condition of the CGU market, analysing the macroeconomic, competitive, regulatory and technological climate
together with the CGU position in this context and the growth opportunities given the market projections and
their competitive positioning.

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash
flow projections from financial budgets covering a five-year period.

_Main assumptions used in calculating value in use_

Value in use is calculated based on the approved business plan and taking into account certain variables
such as operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) margin, capital expenditure (CAPEX)
ratio for non-current assets, expressed as a percentage of revenue, and discount and perpetuity growth rates.

_OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX_

The OIBDA margin and long-term CAPEX ratio used to calculate terminal value, are based on the business
plan approved for the CGU, as well as external estimates of trends in operating indicators, and the outlook for the
various businesses and markets. The rates applied to the cash flow projections in the year were as follows:

_Discount rate_

The discount rate used by management, applied to measure free cash flow, is the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), determined by the weighted average cost of equity and debt according to the finance structure
established for each CGU.

The pre-tax discount rate, applied to the cash flow projections in the year was as follows:

_Perpetuity growth rate_

Cash flow projections to the end of the asset’s useful life are estimated using a rate of growth for the future
years.

Terminal value is calculated from the projected cash flows in the period, taking as the perpetuity growth rate
consensus estimates among analysts for the business and the country based on the maturity of the industry
depending on technology and the degree of development. Each indicator is compared to the forecast long-term
GDP growth adjusted for any specific characteristics of the business.

The perpetuity growth rate applied to the cash flow projections in the year was as follows:

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Group carries out a sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable changes in the
main assumptions used in calculating value in use assuming the following increases or decreases in the
assumptions. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions
would cause the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

On 2 October 2018 the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, O2 Communications Limited, created and issued
new ordinary shares holding a value of £10 million. The Company subscribed to these shares in full, increasing
its investment in the entity by £10 million.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are
certain events or changes indicating the possibility that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The
potential impairment loss is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the investments in subsidiary
undertakings. If this recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

In the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 the impairment review identified that no
additional impairment was required to be recognised in relation to the Company’s investments. The recoverable
amount, being the value in use of the investments in Telefonica UK Limited, O2 Cedar Limited and O2
Networks Limited, was concluded to be not less than the net book amount. Refer to note 15 for key assumptions
used in the impairment test performed during the year.

**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The recoverable amount of the investments in the other subsidiary undertakings have been assessed based
on the net assets of those entities at 31 December 2018 and was concluded to be not less than the net book
amount.

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**

The Company carries out its sensitivity analysis of the impairment test by considering reasonable changes in
the main assumptions used in calculating value in use. The changes in assumptions if applied individually to the
value in use calculation would have the following impacts for the year ended 31 December 2018, expressed in
percentage points:

**Assumption** **Change** **Valuation impact** **Change** **Valuation impact**
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.50p.p. £ 1,322 million +0.50p.p. -£ 1,104 million

Terminal ratio of CAPEX / Revenues . . -0.50p.p. £ 372 million +0.50p.p. -£ 372 million

Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause
the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Details of the Company’s subsidiaries are provided in Note 16.

The Company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contractual assets.

Amounts on the previous page are presented including VAT, which is reclaimable from Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) upon write off of the underlying trade receivable.

The computation of the loss allowance considers the assessment of specific customer credit risk and any
other indication of impairment.

The movement in the trade receivables and contractual assets loss allowance during the year is as follows:


**Contractual**
**assets**
**£m**


**Trade**

During 2018 the terms of the loan for £590 million were renegotiated. The maturity date was extended from
30 June 2018 to 30 June 2023. Subsequently, a partial repayment of this loan was made for £150 million. The
original purpose of this loan was to assist with the acquisition of 800MHz 4G spectrum. The loan had an interest
rate based on LIBOR plus 272 basis points up until 30 June 2018 and LIBOR plus 105 basis points from 1 July
2018 and is calculated on a quarterly basis. The effective rate of interest on the loan for 2018 was 2.59% (2017:
3.06%).

During 2018 the Group entered into a new loan for £524 million with a maturity date of 30 June 2022. The
loan has an interest rate based on LIBOR plus 90 basis points up and is calculated on a quarterly basis. The
effective rate of interest on the loan for 2018 was 1.66%. The purpose of this loan was to assist with the
acquisition of 2.3GHz 4G and 3.4GHz 5G spectrum.

Company current borrowings at 31 December 2017 represent a loan payable to Cellular Radio Limited, a
subsidiary company, and the purpose of the loan is the provision of general trading activities. The loan was
repayable on demand and had an effective rate of interest of 1.1% based on based on LIBOR plus 42 basis points
and is calculated on an annual basis. The loan was repaid in full during 2018.

**Restructuring provisions**

Restructuring provisions include the full costs of planned business restructuring programmes, entered into
during the current and prior years.

**Asset retirement provisions**

The Group has certain legal obligations relating to the restoration of leased property to its original condition
at the end of the lease term. This obligation relates principally to the Group’s share of obligation for assets held
in Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited, and to mast sites.

The provision is based on assumptions covering the discount rate, expected lease renewals and the expected
cost of restoring the sites. The payment dates of these asset retirement costs are uncertain but are currently
anticipated to be over the next 21 years.

The provision recognised represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the current statement of financial position date. Such cost estimates, expressed at current price
levels at the date of the estimate are discounted at 31 December 2018 using rates in the range of 1.33% - 2.05%
(2017: 1.00% - 1.95%) per annum. The initial discounted cost amount has been capitalised as part of property,
plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the assets.

**29. Share-based payments**

**Equity-settled share options scheme**

The main share-based payment plans in place during the period are as follows:

**_Telefónica Performance Investment Share Plan 2014-2019_**

The Telefónica S.A. General Shareholders’ Meeting on 30 May 2014 approved a new instalment of the
long-term share-based incentive “Performance and Investment Plan” for certain senior executives and members
of the management team of the Telefónica Group, operational on completion of the first Performance and
Investment Plan.

The term of the new plan is a total of five years divided into three phases. The initial and the second share
allocations took place on 01 October 2014 and on 01 October 2015 respectively. Regarding the third phase of this
2016-2019 plan, Telefónica S.A.’s Board of Directors, following a favourable report from the Nomination,
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, resolved not to execute or implement it, after having
decided that it was not sufficiently in line with the Telefónica Group’s strategic plan, taking into account the
circumstances and macroeconomic environment.

The first phase expired on 30 September 2017. The maximum number of shares assigned to this phase of the
plan was 463,600 shares, assigned on 1 October 2014 with a fair value of €6.82 per share. Delivery of the shares
was not required at the end of the phase according to the general conditions of the plan; therefore managers did
not receive any shares.

The second phase expired on 30 September 2018. The maximum number of shares assigned to this phase of
the plan was 354,360 shares, assigned on 1 October 2015 with a fair value of €6.46 per share. Delivery of the
shares was not required at the end of the phase according to the general conditions of the plan; therefore
managers did not receive any shares.

**_Talent for the future Share Plan (TFSP) 2014-2019_**

The TFSP is a long-term programme aimed to recognise and reward employees with consistent outstanding
performance, high potential and key skills.

**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

At the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica S.A. held on 30 May 2014, a long-term share-based
incentive plan called “Talent for the Future Share Plan” was approved for certain Telefónica Group employees.

Under this Plan, a certain number of shares of Telefónica S.A. will be delivered to participants selected by
the company who have opted to take part in the scheme and meet the requirements and conditions stipulated to
this end.

The term of the plan is five years and it is divided into three phases. At the beginning of each phase, each
participant was allocated a notional number of shares. According to the plan, the number of shares to be
delivered will depend upon Telefónica S.A.’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance compared to the
TSR of the companies making up the 50th percentile of the Comparison Group.

The initial and the second share allocations took place on 1 October 2014 and on 1 October 2015
respectively. Regarding the third phase of this 2016-2019 plan, Telefónica S.A.’s Board of Directors, following a
favourable report from the Nomination, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, resolved not to
execute or implement it, after having decided that it was not sufficiently in line with the Telefónica Group’s
strategic plan, taking into account the circumstances and macroeconomic environment.

The first phase expired on 30 September 2017. The maximum number of shares assigned to this phase of the
plan was 48,500 shares, assigned on 1 October 2014 with a fair value of €6.82 per share. Delivery of shares was
not required at the end of the phase according to the general conditions of the plan.

No shares were assigned in the second and third phases of the plan.

**_Telefonica Performance Investment Share Plan 2018-2022_**

The Telefónica, S.A. General Shareholders’ Meeting on 8 June 2018 approved a new instalment of the longterm share-based incentive “Performance and Investment Plan” for certain senior executives and members of the
management team of the Telefonica Group.

The term of the plan is a total of five years divided into three phases, each of a three year duration. The first
cycle was deemed to have started on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the
Plan, employees will be entitled to receive a certain maximum number of shares of Telefónica S.A., upon
fulfillment of certain requirements, namely:

1. The final delivery of shares is conditional upon the employee remaining in the entity’s employ during the
vesting period.

2. The final number of shares granted is subject to certain performance conditions based on:

a. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered upon achievement of a certain Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) target that must be satisfied during the period in which the evolution of the TSR of the
Telefónica Group is measured.

b. 50% of the total shares shall be delivered if a certain free cash flow (“FCF”) target is met.

Thus, if certain performance levels and FCF targets are achieved, the employee is entitled to receive 100%
of the maximum number of shares awarded, whereas if only one of the targets is met, the employee shall receive
the related shares.

468,234 shares were assigned in the first phase with a fair value of €6.46 per share for the FCF linked shares
and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

and €4.52 per share for TSR linked shares.

**_Global Employee Share Plan 2015-2017_**

The Telefónica S.A. Ordinary General Shareholers’ Meeting on 30 May 2014, the shareholders approved a
new voluntary plan for incentivised purchases of shares for the employees of the Group. Under the plan
employees were offered the option to acquire Telefónica S.A. shares during a twelve-month period (the
acquisition period), with the company undertaking to deliver a certain number of free shares to participants,
subject to certain requirements.

The total term of the plan was two years. Employees joining the plan could acquire Telefónica S.A. shares
through maximum monthly instalments of €150 (or the local currency equivalent) up to a maximum of €1,800
over a period of 12 months (acquisition period) and the minimum contribution to be made by each participant
would be €25. Shares were delivered upon vesting of the plan, on 31 July 2017. The employees that remained
part of the Telefónica Group and held on to the shares for one year following the acquisition period (the
shareholding period), were entitled to receive one free share for each share they acquired and retained throughout
the shareholding period.

The acquisition period commenced in July 2015 and ended in June 2016. The plan’s shareholding period
came to an end in August 2017. On the vesting date, 909 employees adhered to the plan and were rewarded with
a total of 79,099 of Telefónica shares, with a fair value per share of €9.56 at the time they were delivered.

**30. Retirement benefit schemes**

Telefonica Europe plc (the Company’s ultimate UK parent company) acted as Sponsor and Principal
Employer of the Plan up to 14 December 2018. On this date a deed was signed by the trustees to transfer the plan
into the Company as the majority of employees participating in the plan are employees of the Company. The
transfer was made via a capital contribution from Telefonica Europe plc for £23.1 million, being the net asset
position of the plan on the transfer date.

The Telefónica UK Pension Plan (“the Plan”) comprises the following:

       - The defined benefit scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

       - The defined contribution scheme of the Telefónica UK Pension Plan

       - The UK defined benefit Unfunded Plan

The retirement benefit obligation of the Plan is therefore recognised on the statement of financial position of
Telefonica UK Limited as at 31 December 2018, having previously been recognised by Telefonica Europe plc.

The net defined benefit expense and actuarial valuation impacts of the defined benefit scheme, as assessed
in accordance with the advice of a qualified, independent actuary, measuring actuarial liabilities using the
projected unit method and taking assets at market value, are recognised in the statement of total comprehensive
income of Telefonica Europe plc up to the date of transfer to Telefonica UK limited on 14 December 2018.

The Plan provides the pension benefits for the majority of Telefonica’s UK employees, including those of
Telefonica UK Limited. Participating companies whose employees are members are the Plan account for the
defined benefit sections of the plan as though it were a defined contribution plan as there is no contractual
arrangement or stated policy for charging out the net defined benefit cost between participating employers.
Telefonica UK Limited therefore expensed any contributions payable to the defined benefit sections of the plan
for the period up to 14 December 2018.

With effect from 28 February 2013 the defined benefit scheme of the Plan was closed to new entrants and
further benefit accrual. The only funding provided into the defined benefit scheme of the Plan after this date has
been the additional deficit funding payments and the section 75 payment. Members’ defined benefit pensions will
continue to be increased in deferment by reference to the Consumer Prices Index but will not retain the link to
any future increases in salary. Upon closure, members of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan were given the
option to become members of the defined contribution scheme of the Plan. The defined contribution scheme of
the Plan remains open to new entrants and further contributions and the employer contributions are recognised as
part of the staff costs in the participating entities. The assets of the Plan are held independently of the Group’s
finances.

The liabilities of the UK defined benefit Unfunded plan are recorded within the statement of financial
position of O2 Holdings Limited, as it relates to ex-employees of O2 Holdings Limited. The costs arising from
the Unfunded plan are borne by O2 Holdings Limited, and are reflected on the statement of comprehensive
income of the Company.

The total charge included in the statement of comprehensive income for the Group’s entire pension schemes
are as follows:

**Actuarial valuation**

A full valuation of the defined benefit section of the Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2017 by a
suitably qualified independent actuary. The valuation used the projected unit method.

The initial results of the actuarial valuation of the Plan as at 30 September 2017 have been updated to
31 December 2018 by a third party qualified actuary in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. The defined
benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are stated at fair value.

The Plan’s assets are currently invested in a diversified range of credit assets and long-dated inflation linked
gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability characteristics. No payment was made to the defined benefit
scheme by the company or by anyone in the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: £ nil).

The amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2018 (2017:
amounts included in the statement of financial position of Telefonica Europe plc for the funded scheme) arising
from obligations in respect of the defined benefit scheme of the Plan are as follows:

Plan assets are valued by reference to quoted market prices in active markets. No assets of Telefonica
Europe plc are held by the Plan.

At 31 December 2018, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation of the funded plan
was 23 years (2017: 23 years).

The position and results reported are subject to the accuracy of the assumptions used.

A reduction in the discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A rise in the discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

An increase in the inflation rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities as a higher value is placed on
benefits paid in the future. A reduction in the inflation rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.

There is also uncertainty around the future life expectancy of the UK population. The value of current and
future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.

The following table summarises the estimated sensitivity of the disclosed liability value to changes in the
principal assumptions that have been used in the calculations:

**Charge by assumption** **Liabilities increase by:**
Decrease discount rate by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £87 million
Increase inflation rate by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £83 million

**Investment commentary**

As at 31 December 2018, the Plan was fully invested in line with the SIP following the final drawdown of
capital for the Partners Group mandate. The Plan’s assets were invested in a diversified range of credit assets and
long-dated inflation linked gilts, which are aligned to the Plan’s liability characteristics. This strategy is achieved
through a mixture of direct investments in the target asset classes and derivatives. This includes the Liability
Driven Investment strategy which aims to reduce the Plan’s exposure to interest rate and inflation risk.

The Plan’s exposure at the end of the reporting period for each category of assets is as follows:

The figures above are as at the statement of financial position date. Market values of Plan’s assets, which
are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant changes before they are realised.
All equity securities and credit opportunities have quoted prices in active markets.

**Other pension plans**

The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme in the UK. The assets of these defined contribution
arrangements are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The expense, in
the statement of comprehensive income, relating to the defined contribution section of the Plan is equal to the
contributions paid over the period presented, which totaled £35 million for the year ended 31 December 2018
(2017: £35 million).

**31. Financial instruments and capital management**

**31.1 Financial risk factors and management**

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and trade
and other payables. The purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and short term deposits.

The main sources of risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are currency risk, interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk. Management of the Group’s financial risks is achieved mostly through being a part
of the larger Telefónica Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in each area and is able to hedge
positions on a Group basis.

**O2 Holdings Limited**
**Notes to the financial statements — (Continued)**
**For the year ended 31 December 2018**

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. No detailed sensitivity analysis is presented, as the Group considers that its risk exposure has been
appropriately mitigated. The principal financial risks of the Group and how the Group manages these risks are
discussed below.

**(a)** **Market risk**

**(i)** **Foreign currency risk**

The Group operates mainly in the United Kingdom. The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange
risks arising from various currency movements, primarily with respect to the Euro and US dollar that can affect
its results and financial position. The impact of any reasonable change in foreign exchange rates would not have
a significant impact on the result of the Group for the year.

The Group also has a small amount of transactional exposure. Such exposure arises from revenues and
purchases by an operating unit that is in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Significant
exposures are managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and the Telefónica Group managing
positions on a Telefónica Group wide basis.

**(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the effects of movements in interest rates on the value of
the Group’s long-term borrowings and interest received on cash and cash equivalents. The Group’s long term
borrowings and other financial assets are at fixed interest rates. The majority of the Group’s cash and cash
equivalents are deposited with a central Telefonica Group company that pays interest at variable market rates.

The impact of any reasonable change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the result of
the Group for the year.

**Effective interest rates and re-pricing analysis**

In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table
indicates the periods in which they re-price or mature (whichever date is earlier). Their effective interest rates at
the statement of financial position date are disclosed in Note 22. Accrued interest has been included in the
analysis.

**(b) Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

The Group’s principal credit risks are attributable to its trade receivables. Trade receivables as presented in
the statement of financial position are net of provision for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management
based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Management has a credit
policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

At the statement of financial position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counter-parties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the
statement of financial position. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. The Group
does not have a significant exposure to credit risk.

**(c)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with
financial liabilities.

Management of the Group’s liquidity risk is achieved mostly through being a part of the larger Telefónica
Group, which operates Telefónica Group wide policies in this area. The Group holds financial assets primarily in
short-term deposits with a central Telefónica Group company that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash. These measures help keep liquidity risk low.

The following tables set out contractual undiscounted cash outflows of financial liabilities, including interest
payments:

**Supplier financing arrangements**

The Group operates a supplier financing scheme for certain suppliers that allows them to be paid earlier than
the invoice due date. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the
payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; these
indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. The balances
contained within trade payables amount to £302 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: £195 million). As at
31 December 2018 none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be
reclassified as borrowings.

**31.2 Capital management**

The Group’s capital comprises share capital, a capital reserve (see Note 26) and retained earnings.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue to operate as
a going concern, to maintain optimal capital structure commensurate with risk and return and to reduce the cost
of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay dividends to its shareholder, return
capital to its shareholder, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt or draw down more debt.

Related party transactions with Directors and key management are detailed in Note 8.

**33. Contingent Liabilities**

**_Anti-bribery_**

The Group has been addressing a request for disclosure made by governmental authorities which is related
to possible violations of anti-bribery laws and regulations. The Group continues to co-operate with the
governmental authorities investigating this matter which is still ongoing. Also the Group is conducting its own
internal investigation on the matter. It is not possible at this time to predict the full scope or duration of this
matter or its likely outcome.

**_Phones 4u_**

Legal proceedings have been issued in the High Court against the Group by the Administrators of Phones
4u. The Group has vigorously denied the allegations and filed its defence to this claim in April 2019. No
provision has been made in relation to this matter.

**34. Subsequent events**

**Acquisition of Statiq Limited**

On 30 April 2019, Telefonica UK Limited acquired 100% of the shares of Statiq Limited for a cash
consideration of £715,000, from Telefonica Digital Limited, a fellow subsidiary within the Telefónica Group.

**Annual Licence Fees**

In 2015, by way of regulations (2015 Regulations), Ofcom reset the existing regulations (2011 Regulations)
for Annual Licence Fees (ALFs) for the 900 & 1800 MHz bands from approximately £65m to £200m per annum
for all mobile network operators (MNOs). Telefonica UK’s fees were set at £49.8m pa. The 2015 Regulations
were quashed in 2017 pursuant to a Court of Appeal judgment which held that they had been determined
unlawfully by Ofcom. The fees regime reverted to the pre-existing 2011 Regulations and the lower fees set in
these Regulations.

Telefonica UK and the other MNOs disputed a claim against Ofcom for repayment of the difference
between the amounts paid under the unlawful 2015 Regulations and the lawful 2011 Regulations. Telefonica
UK’s claim was initially £52.8m plus interest. This figure increased to £54.4m plus interest in 2019 due to a
payment being incorrectly characterised when the claim was first formulated.

Ofcom disputed that the MNOs were entitled to claim the difference in this way, instead asserting that the
MNOs were only entitled to the difference between the amount paid under the unlawful 2015 Regulations and a
notional amount that would have been paid had Ofcom put in place lawful regulations at the relevant time (which
Ofcom noted would have been of a similar level to the 2015 Regulation fees based on a new consultation and
subsequent 2018 Regulations that came into force which set ALFs at a broadly similar level as they had been set
by the 2015 Regulations).

The Judge held on 17 May 2019 that the MNOs had won their claim and that they were entitled to
restitution of the overpaid ALF’s. Telefonica UK received the principal sum in dispute plus interest and certain
of its costs. Pursuant to this judgement, Ofcom paid Telefonica UK the principal sum in dispute plus interest and
certain of its costs from Ofcom on 22 May 2019. However, the Judge also gave Ofcom permission to appeal the
decision to the Court of Appeal. Ofcom has sought to pursue the appeal and they filed their Appellant’s Notice
on 7 June 2019. We do not expect a hearing to be listed until 2020.

The judgement made during 2019 represents a non-adjusting subsequent event for the year ended
31 December 2018 as the change relates to 2019. Therefore an asset has not been recognised at 31 December
2018.

any, that the applicable person takes such action or (y) the taking of any action by any person that is not

such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under this Agreement and the other Relevant
Finance Documents and (B) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the
extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by this Agreement and the other
Relevant Finance Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently remedied
(a “Cured Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or
omitting to take any action by any person, which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not
have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be deemed to be remedied automatically upon,
and simultaneously with, the remedy of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this
Clause 1.14:

(i) in the case of an Initial Default described in sub-paragraph (y) above, if an officer of the Company
had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and
was continuing; or

(ii) if the Facility Agent shall have declared all Outstandings to be immediately due and payable
pursuant to the provisions described under Clause 26.19 (Acceleration) prior to the date such
Initial Default would have been deemed to be remedied under this paragraph.

(b) For purposes of this Clause 1.14, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an officer of the Company,
(i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have
obtained if such individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of
diligence and care as would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or deliver
a required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is
remedied, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be remedied without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default
for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in Clause 23.2 (Financial information), or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be remedied upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in this
Agreement.

**1.15 Baskets**

(a) In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in this Agreement, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify and may from
time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be

avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between
different baskets or exceptions).

is set by reference to a percentage of Annualised EBITDA or Total Assets (“EBITDA or Total Assets
**based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts or actions taken are, at the time of incurrence or**
being taken, duly and properly incurred or taken in accordance with the relevant basket, test or
permission) be treated as having been duly and properly incurred or taken without the occurrence of a
Default or Event of Default in the event that such EBITDA or Total Assets based basket subsequently
decreases.

another and/or acquire rights against one another as the Obligors and the Increase Lender would have
assumed and/or acquired had the Increase Lender been an Original Lender.

(d) Each Increase Lender shall become a Party as a “Lender” and any Increase Lender and each of the

(iii) each participating Lender consenting to such increase.

(h) The Company may pay to any Increase Lender a fee in the amount and at the times agreed between the
Company and the Increase Lender.

that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been
approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or
prior to the date on which the increase becomes effective.

(j) The execution by the Company of an Increase Confirmation constitutes confirmation by each
Guarantor that its obligations under Clause 28 (Guarantee and Indemnity) shall continue unaffected
except that those obligations shall extend to the Total Commitments as increased by the addition of the
new Commitments of any Increase Lender and shall be owed to each Finance Party including the
relevant Lender.

payable under the Relevant Finance Documents by that Lender to the L/C Bank in respect of that
Documentary Credit.

(c) Until no amount is or may be outstanding under that Documentary Credit, withdrawals from the
account may only be made to pay to the relevant L/C Bank amounts due and payable to the relevant L/
C Bank by the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender under the Relevant Finance Documents in respect of that
Documentary Credit.

(d) Each Lender under the Revolving Facility shall notify the Facility Agent and the Company:

(i) on the 2019 Amendment and Restatement Date or on any later date on which it becomes such a
Lender in accordance with Clause 2.3 (Increase) or Clause 36 (Assignments and Transfers) if it is
a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and

(ii) as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the same, that it has become a Non-Acceptable L/
C Lender,

and an indication in a Transfer Deed, a Transfer Agreement or in an Increase Confirmation to that
effect will constitute a notice under paragraph (d)(i) to the Facility Agent and, upon delivery in
accordance with Clause 36.16 (Copy of Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement or Increase Confirmation
_to Company), to the Company._

(e) Any notice received by the Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall constitute notice to
each L/C Bank of that Lender’s status and the Facility Agent shall, upon receiving each such notice,
promptly notify each L/C Bank of that Lender’s status as specified in that notice.

(f) If a Lender who has provided cash collateral in accordance with this Clause 5.9 (Cash Collateral by
_Non-Acceptable L/C Lender):_

(i) ceases to be a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and

(ii) no amount is due and payable by that Lender in respect of a Documentary Credit,

that Lender may, at any time it is not a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender, by notice to the relevant L/C
Bank request that an amount equal to the amount of the cash provided by it as collateral in respect
of that Documentary Credit (together with any accrued interest) standing to the credit of the
relevant account held with that L/C Bank be returned to it and that L/C Bank shall pay that
amount to the Lender within three Business Days after the request from the Lender (and shall
cooperate with the Lender in order to procure that the relevant security or collateral arrangement
is released and discharged).

**5.10 Cash Cover by Borrower**

(a) If a Lender which is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender fails to provide cash collateral (or notifies the
relevant L/C Bank that it will not provide cash collateral) in accordance with Clause 5.9 (Cash
_Collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender) and that L/C Bank notifies the Obligors’ Agent (with a copy_
to the Facility Agent) that it requires the relevant Borrower of the relevant Documentary Credit or
proposed Documentary Credit to provide cash cover to an account with that L/C Bank in an amount
equal to that Lender’s L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of that Documentary Credit and in the
currency of that Documentary Credit then that Borrower shall do so within five Business Days after the
notice is given.

(b) Notwithstanding Clause 1.3(s) (Construction), the relevant Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw
amounts up to the level of that cash cover from the account if:

(i) the relevant L/C Bank is satisfied that the relevant Lender is no longer a Non-Acceptable L/C
Lender; or

(ii) the relevant Lender’s obligations in respect of the relevant Documentary Credit are transferred to
a New Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or

AA-66

(iii) an Increase Lender has agreed to undertake the obligations in respect of the relevant Lender’s L/C
Proportion of the Documentary Credit.

(c) To the extent that a Borrower has complied with its obligations to provide cash cover in accordance
with this Clause 5.10 (Cash Cover by Borrower), the relevant Lender’s L/C Proportion in respect of
that Documentary Credit will remain (but that Lender’s obligations in relation to that Documentary
Credit may be satisfied in accordance Clause 1.3(s)(ii) (Construction)). However, the relevant
Borrower’s obligation to pay any Documentary Credit fee in relation to the relevant Documentary
Credit to the Facility Agent (for the account of that Lender) in accordance with Clause 16
(Commissions and Fees) will be reduced proportionately as from the date on which it complies with
that obligation to provide cash cover (and for so long as the relevant amount of cash cover continues to

issued consent to such resignation or so require; (ii) there is, in the reasonable opinion of each L/C
Bank, an actual or potential conflict of interest in it continuing to act as L/C Bank; or (iii) its Revolving

pursuant to paragraphs (f) or (g) above.

**6.2 Operation of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the terms governing the operation of any Ancillary Facility (including
the rate of interest (including default interest), fees, commission and other remuneration in respect of

of any monies or demand cash cover for any Ancillary Facility Outstandings, or take any analogous
action in respect of any Ancillary Facility, until the Acceleration Date.

(b) If an Acceleration Date occurs, the claims of each Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment or
Additional Facility Commitment (as applicable) and each Ancillary Facility Lender in respect of
amounts outstanding to them under the Revolving Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable) and the
related Ancillary Facilities respectively shall be adjusted in accordance with this Clause 6.3 (Ancillary
_Facility Default) by making all necessary transfers of such portions of such claims such that following_
such transfers the Revolving Facility Outstandings or Additional Facility Outstandings (as applicable)
and the related Ancillary Facility Outstandings (together with the rights to receive interest, fees and
charges in relation thereto) of (i) each Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment or Additional
Facility Commitment (as applicable) and (ii) each Ancillary Facility Lender, in each case as at the
Acceleration Date shall be an amount corresponding pro rata to the proportion that the sum of such
Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment or Additional Facility Commitment (as applicable) and/or
(as the case may be) related Ancillary Facility Commitment bears to the sum of all of the Revolving
Facility Commitments or Additional Facility Commitments (as applicable) and the related Ancillary
Facility Commitments, each as at the Acceleration Date.

(c) No later than the third Business Day following the Acceleration Date each of the Ancillary Facility
Lenders shall notify the Facility Agent in writing of the Sterling Amount of its Ancillary Facility
Outstandings as at the close of business on the Acceleration Date, such amount to take account of any
clearing of debits which were entered into the clearing system of such Ancillary Facility Lenders prior
to the Acceleration Date and any amounts credited to the relevant accounts prior to close of business on
the Acceleration Date.

(d) On receipt of the information referred to in paragraph (c) above, the Facility Agent will promptly
determine what adjustment payments (if any) are necessary as between the Lenders participating in the
Revolving Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable) and each related Ancillary Facility Lender in
order to ensure that, following such adjustment payments, the requirements of paragraph (b) above are
complied with.

(e) The Facility Agent will notify all the Lenders as soon as practicable of its determinations pursuant to
paragraph (d) above, giving details of the adjustment payments required to be made. Such adjustment
payments shall be payable by the relevant Lenders and shall be made to the Facility Agent within 5
Business Days following receipt of such notification from the Facility Agent. The Facility Agent shall
distribute the adjustment payments received, among the Ancillary Facility Lenders and the Lenders
participating in the Revolving Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable) in order to satisfy the
requirements of paragraph (b) above.

(f) If at any time following the Acceleration Date, the amount of Revolving Facility Outstandings or
Additional Facility Outstandings (as applicable) of any Lender or related Ancillary Facility
Outstandings of any Ancillary Facility Lender used in the Facility Agent’s calculation of the
adjustments required under paragraph (d) above should vary for any reason (other than as a result of
currency exchange fluctuation or other reason which affects all relevant Lenders equally), further
adjustment payments shall be made on the same basis (mutatis mutandis) provided for in this Clause
6.3 (Ancillary Facility Default).

(g) In respect of any amount paid by any Lender (a “Paying Lender”) pursuant to either of paragraphs
(e) or (f) above, as between a relevant Borrower and the Paying Lender, the amount so paid shall be
immediately due and payable by such relevant Borrower to the Paying Lender and the payment

AA-69

obligations of such relevant Borrower to the Lender(s) which received such payment shall be treated as
correspondingly reduced by the amount of such payment.

(h) Each Lender shall promptly supply to the Facility Agent such information as the Facility Agent may
from time to time request for the purpose of giving effect to this Clause 6.3 (Ancillary Facility
_Default)._

(i) If an Ancillary Facility Lender has the benefit of any Security Interest securing any of its Ancillary
Facilities, the realisations from such security when enforced will be treated as an amount recovered by
such Ancillary Facility Lender in its capacity as a Lender which is subject to the sharing arrangements
in Clause 34 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties) to the intent that such realisation should
benefit all Lenders pro rata.

**6.4 Repayment of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) No Ancillary Facility Lender may demand repayment or prepayment of any amounts under its
Ancillary Facility unless:

(i) the Revolving Facility Commitments or Additional Facility Commitment (as applicable) have
been cancelled in full, or the Facility Agent has declared all Outstandings under the Revolving
Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable) immediately due and payable; or

(ii) the Ancillary Facility Outstandings under that Ancillary Facility can be repaid by a Revolving
Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance (as applicable) (and not less than 7 Business
Days notice (or such shorter period as agreed to by the Company) is given to the relevant
Borrower before payment becomes due).

(b) For the purposes of repaying Ancillary Facility Outstandings (so long as paragraph (a)(i) above does
not apply) a Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance (as applicable) may be
borrowed irrespective of whether a Default is outstanding or any other applicable condition precedent
not satisfied.

(c) The share of the Ancillary Facility Lender in a Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility
Advance (as applicable) being used to refinance that Ancillary Facility Lender’s Ancillary Facility will
be that amount which will result (so far as possible) in:

(i) the proportion which its share of all Outstandings under the Revolving Facility or Additional
Facility (as applicable) bears to the aggregate amount of the Outstandings under the Revolving
Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable),

being equal to:

(ii) the proportion which its Available Commitment with respect to the Revolving Facility or
Additional Facility (as applicable) bears to the aggregate of the Available Commitments with
respect to the Revolving Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable),

in each case, assuming the repayment of the relevant Ancillary Facility has taken place. The share of
the other Lenders in any such Revolving Facility Advance or Additional Facility Advance (as
applicable) will be adjusted accordingly.

**6.5 Continuation of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) A Borrower and an Ancillary Facility Lender may, as between themselves only, agree to continue to
provide the same banking facilities following the Termination Date applicable to the Revolving
Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable) or, as the case may be, the Revolving Facility
Commitments or Additional Facility Commitments (as applicable) are cancelled under this Agreement.

(b) If any arrangement contemplated in paragraph (a) above is to occur, the relevant Borrower and the
Ancillary Facility Lender shall each confirm that to be the case in writing to the Facility Agent. Upon
such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation, any such facility shall continue as
between the said entities on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Relevant Finance
Documents. Save for any rights and obligations against any Relevant Finance Party under the Relevant
Finance Documents prior to such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation, no
such rights or obligations in respect of such Ancillary Facility shall, as between the Relevant Finance
Parties, continue and the Security shall not support any such facility in respect of any matters that arise
after such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation.

of Schedule 1 (Lenders and Commitments) and/or the amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment
transferred to or assumed by that Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not
cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this Agreement or (ii) Additional Facility Commitment is
the amount set out opposite the relevant Lender’s name in the relevant Additional Facility Accession
Deed and/or the amount of any relevant Additional Facility Commitment transferred to or assumed by
that Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by
it under this Agreement (as applicable). For the purposes of calculating the Lender’s Available
Commitment with respect to the Revolving Facility or Additional Facility (as applicable), the Lender’s
Commitment shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the Ancillary Facility Commitments of
its Affiliates.

(b) The Company shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any Conversion Notice delivered by
the Company to the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 6.1 (Utilisation of Ancillary Facilities).

(c) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Facility Lender shall accede to this Agreement as

Lender (in accordance with Clause 36 (Assignments and Transfers), its Affiliate shall cease to have any
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Facility Document.

by the Company to the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 6.1 (Utilisation of Ancillary Facilities).

(Resignation of a Borrower), its Affiliate, provided that such Affiliate is not an Affiliate of any other
Obligor, shall cease to have any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Facility Document.

(d) Where this Agreement or any other Relevant Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower
under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party
to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Relevant Finance Document
shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations
under any Relevant Finance Document or Ancillary Facility Document.

event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this Clause 7.2 (Unavailability of Optimal Currency)
will be required to participate in the relevant Revolving Facility Advance in Sterling (in an amount
equal to that Lender’s Proportion of the Sterling Amount of the relevant Revolving Facility Advance
or, in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender’s Proportion of the Sterling Amount
of any amount that the Lenders are actually required to advance in accordance with Clause 8.2
(Rollover)), and its participation will be treated as a separate Advance denominated in Sterling during
that Term.

requested that one or more Revolving Facility Advances or applicable Additional Facility Advances in the
same currency as the Maturing Advance be made to it (a “Rollover Advance”), subject to the Lenders being
obliged to make such Rollover Advance under Clause 4.1 (Conditions to Utilisation), the aggregate amount

(i) the relevant Borrower will only be required to pay an amount in cash in the relevant currency
equal to that excess; and

available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender’s participation (if
any) in the Maturing Advance and that Lender will not be required to make its participation in the
Rollover Advance available in cash; and

(b) if the amount of the Maturing Advance is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the Rollover
Advance:

of such Documentary Credit is reduced in accordance with such notice by providing cash cover
therefor in accordance with Clause 1.3(s) (Construction) (in each case) or by reducing the Outstanding

Business Days before the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest
Period), to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant Lender
of funding its participation in that Advance from whatever source it may reasonably select.

(b) If this Clause 15.4 (Cost of funds) applies or if LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR is to be determined
on the basis of a Reference Bank Rate or an Alternative Reference Bank Rate and the Facility Agent or
the Company so requires, the Facility Agent (acting in its sole discretion and, for the avoidance of
doubt, without any requirement to consult or seek any consent or instruction from the Lenders or any
other Finance Party) and the Company shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty
days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

Lender.

**16.2 Arrangement, Ticking and Underwriting Fee**

as applicable, the fees specified in the Fee Letter at the times and in the amounts specified in such

which the relevant Documentary Credit is denominated at a rate equal to the applicable Revolving Facility
Margin applied on the Outstanding L/C Amount in relation to such Documentary Credit (less any amount
which has been repaid or prepaid). Such documentary credit fee shall be paid in arrears on each Quarter

repayment, prepayment or cancellation, if earlier) for that Documentary Credit.

**16.5 L/C Bank Fee**

**17. TAXES**

**17.1 Tax Gross-up**

(a) Each payment made by the Parent or an Obligor under a Relevant Finance Document shall be made by
it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by Law. Any Tax Deduction in

AA-84


-----

relation to any payment due in any currency other than Sterling shall be calculated using the Facility
Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange on the date such payment is made and the Parent and the Obligors shall
have no liability if any subsequent credit or refund received by any Lender from any tax authority in
relation thereto is in a different amount (when converted to the non-Sterling currency on any date).

(b) As soon as it becomes aware that the Parent or an Obligor is or will be required by Law to make a Tax
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate at which or the basis on which such Tax Deduction is
to be made) the Parent or the relevant Obligor shall notify the Facility Agent accordingly. Similarly, a
Lender shall notify the Facility Agent and the Parent upon becoming so aware in respect of a payment
payable to that Lender.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Parent or an Obligor, the amount of the
payment due shall, unless paragraph (f) below applies, be increased to an amount so that, after the
required Tax Deduction is made, the payee receives an amount equal to the amount it would have
received had no Tax Deduction been required.

(d) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee (other
than by reason of the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee performing its obligations as such under
this Agreement through an office located outside the United Kingdom) from any payment to any
Relevant Finance Party which represents an amount or amounts received from the Parent or an Obligor,
either the Parent or that Obligor, as the case may be, shall, unless paragraph (f) below applies, pay
directly to that Relevant Finance Party an amount which, after making the required Tax Deduction
enables the payee of that amount to receive an amount equal to the payment which it would have
received if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(e) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee from
any payment to any Relevant Finance Party under paragraph (d) above, the Facility Agent or the
Security Trustee as appropriate shall unless paragraph (g) below applies, make that Tax Deduction and
any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction to the relevant taxing authority within the
time allowed and in the minimum amount required by Law and within 30 days of making either a Tax
Deduction or any payment in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Facility Agent or the Security
Trustee, as appropriate, making that Tax Deduction or other payment shall deliver to the relevant
Borrower evidence that the Tax Deduction or other payment has been made or accounted for to the
relevant tax authority.

(f) Neither the Parent nor any Obligor is required to make a Tax Payment to a Lender under paragraphs
(c) or (d) above for a Tax Deduction in respect of tax imposed by the United Kingdom on a payment of
interest by a UK Borrower in respect of a participation in an Advance by that Lender to any UK
Borrower where that Lender is not a Qualifying UK Lender on the date on which the relevant payment
of interest is due (otherwise than as a consequence of a Change in Tax Law) to the extent that payment
could have been made without a Tax Deduction if that Lender had been a Qualifying UK Lender on
that date.

(g) The Parent or the relevant Obligor (as the case may be) which is required to make a Tax Deduction
shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction to the
relevant tax authority within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by Law.

(h) Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax
Deduction, either the Parent or the relevant Obligor making that Tax Deduction or other payment shall
deliver to the Facility Agent for the Relevant Finance Party entitled to the interest to which such Tax
Deduction or payment relates, evidence that the Tax Deduction or other payment has been made or
accounted for to the relevant tax authority.

(i) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment
required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any
payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient
of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

**17.2 Lender Tax Status**

(a) Each Lender to any UK Borrower represents and warrants to the Facility Agent and to each UK
Borrower:

(i) in the case of a Lender under the Revolving Facility as at the 2019 Amendment and Restatement
Date, that as at the 2019 Amendment and Restatement Date, it has the tax status set out opposite
its name in Part 2 of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax Status); or

AA-85


-----

(ii) in the case of any other Lender, that as at the relevant Transfer Date, Increase Date or the date of
the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed, it is:

(A) a UK Bank Lender;

(B) a UK Non-Bank Lender and falls within paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition thereof;

(C) a UK Treaty Lender; or

(D) not a Qualifying UK Lender,

as the same shall be expressly indicated in the relevant Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Increase
Confirmation or Additional Facility Accession Deed.

(b) Each Lender expressed to be a “UK Non-Bank Lender” in Part 2 of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax Status) or
in the Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Additional Facility Accession Deed or Increase
Confirmation pursuant to which it becomes a Lender represents and warrants to:

(i) the Facility Agent and each UK Borrower, on the 2019 Amendment and Restatement Date, or on
the relevant Transfer Date, Increase Date or the date of the relevant Additional Facility Accession
Deed (as the case may be) that it is within paragraph (a) of the definition of UK Non-Bank Lender
on that date (unless, if it is not within such paragraph (a), it is within paragraph (b) of such
definition on that date, and has notified the Facility Agent of the circumstances by virtue of which
it falls within such paragraph (b) and has provided evidence of the same to the Company if and to
the extent requested to do so, by the Facility Agent or the Company); and

(ii) the Facility Agent and each UK Borrower, that unless it notifies the Facility Agent and the
Company to the contrary in writing prior to any such date, its representation and warranty in
paragraph (i) above is true in relation to that Lender’s participation in each Advance made to such
Borrowers, on each date that such UK Borrower makes a payment of interest in relation to such
Advance.

(c) (i) A Lender under the Revolving Facility on the 2019 Amendment and Restatement Date that holds
a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and which wishes that Scheme to apply
to this Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of the Facility Agent
and without liability to any Parent Entity or any Obligor) by including its scheme reference
number and its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in Part 2 of Schedule 1 (Lenders Tax
_Status)._

(ii) A New Lender, an Additional Facility Lender or an Increase Lender that holds a passport under
the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and which wishes that Scheme to apply to this
Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of the Facility Agent and
without liability to any Parent Entity or any Obligor) by including its scheme reference number
and its jurisdiction of tax residence in the Transfer Deed, Transfer Agreement, Additional Facility
Accession Deed or Increase Confirmation which it executes.

(iii) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in
accordance with paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) above, then neither any Parent Entity nor any Obligor shall
make any filing under or in relation to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme in respect of that
Lender’s Commitment(s) or its participation in any Advance unless that Lender otherwise agrees.

(iv) The Parent or the relevant Obligor that makes a payment to which that Lender is entitled shall
cooperate with the Lender in completing any procedural formalities as may be necessary for either
the Parent or the relevant Obligor to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a Tax
Deduction (including where a Lender includes the indication described in paragraphs (c)(i) or
(ii) above, filing with HMRC, within any applicable time limit, a form DTTP2 or such equivalent
or other HMRC form(s) as may be required to be filed pursuant to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport
Scheme in respect of that Lender, completed in accordance with the information provided by that
Lender); provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph (c)(iv) shall require a Lender to
disclose any confidential information or information regarding its business, tax affairs or tax
computations (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its calculations).

(d) (i) If, in relation to any interest payment to a Lender on an Advance made to a UK Borrower:

(A) that Lender has confirmed to the relevant UK Borrower and to the Facility Agent before that
interest payment would otherwise fall due that:

(1) it has completed, where applicable, the necessary procedural formalities referred to in,
and otherwise complied with, paragraph (c) above; and

AA-86


-----

(2) H.M. Revenue & Customs has not declined to issue the authorisation referred to in the
definition of “UK Treaty Lender” (the “Authorisation”) in respect of that Lender in
relation to that Advance, or if H.M. Revenue & Customs has declined, the Lender is
disputing that decision in good faith; and

(B) the relevant UK Borrower has not received the Authorisation,

then, such Lender may elect, by not less than five Business Days prior confirmation in writing to
the Facility Agent, that such interest payment (the “Relevant Interest Payment”) shall not be due
and payable under Clause 13.1 (Interest Payment Date for Revolving Facility Advances) or Clause
14.4 (Payment of Interest for Term Facility Advances) (as applicable) until the date (the
“Confirmation Date”) which is five Business Days after the earlier of:

(C) the date on which the Authorisation is received by the relevant UK Borrower;

(D) the date that Lender confirms to the relevant UK Borrower and the Facility Agent that it is
not entitled to claim full relief from liability to taxation otherwise imposed by the United
Kingdom (in relation to that Lender’s participation in Advances made to that UK Borrower)
on interest under a Double Taxation Treaty in relation to the Relevant Interest Payment; and

(E) the earlier of (1) the date which is six months after the date on which the Relevant Interest
Payment had otherwise been due and payable and (2) the date of final repayment (whether
scheduled, voluntary or mandatory) of principal in respect of the Relevant Interest Payment.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that paragraph (i) above applies, the Interest Period or
Term to which the Relevant Interest Payment relates shall not be extended and the start of the
immediately succeeding Interest Period or Term shall not be delayed.

(e) Any Lender which was either:

(i) a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently ceases to be a Qualifying UK
Lender; or

(ii) not a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently becomes a Qualifying UK
Lender,

(in each case, other than by reason of a Change in Tax Law in the United Kingdom) shall promptly
notify the UK Borrowers of that event, provided that if there is a Change in Tax Law in the United
Kingdom which in the reasonable opinion of such UK Borrowers may result in any Lender which was,
either: (i) a Qualifying UK Lender when it became a Party ceasing to be a Qualifying UK Lender, or
(ii) not a Qualifying UK Lender when it became Party but subsequently becomes a Qualifying UK
Lender, such Qualifying UK Lender or non-Qualifying UK Lender (as applicable) shall co-operate with
such UK Borrowers and provide reasonable evidence requested by such UK Borrowers in order for
such UK Borrowers to determine whether such Lender has ceased to be a Qualifying UK Lender or
became a Qualifying UK Lender (as applicable) provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph
(e) shall require a Lender to disclose any confidential information or information regarding its
business, tax affairs or tax computations (including without limitation, its tax returns or its
calculations).

(f) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) to (e) above, each Lender shall promptly deliver such documents
evidencing its corporate and tax status as the Facility Agent or the Company may reasonably request,
provided that in the event that any Lender fails to comply with the foregoing requirement, any UK
Borrower shall be permitted:

(i) to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the applicable withholding tax estimated in good
faith by the Borrower to be required to be withheld in respect of interest payable to such Lender;
or

(ii) subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of Clause 36.4 (Assignments or Transfers by Lenders),
to refuse to grant its consent to such transfer.

(g) In the event that either the Facility Agent or the Company has reason to believe that any representation
given by a Lender in accordance with this Clause 17.2 (Lender Tax Status) is incorrect or inaccurate,
the Facility Agent or the Company (as the case may be) shall promptly inform the other party and the
relevant Lender, and may thereafter request such documents relating to the corporate and tax status of
such Lender as the Facility Agent or the Company may reasonably require for the purposes of
determining whether or not such representation was indeed incorrect.

AA-87


-----

(h) If, following delivery of such documentation and following consultation between the Facility Agent,
the Company and the relevant Lender, the Company concludes (acting reasonably and in good faith)
that there is insufficient evidence to determine the relevant tax status of such Lender, the UK Borrower
shall be permitted in respect of such Lender, to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the
applicable withholding tax estimated in good faith by the UK Borrower to be required to be withheld in
respect of interest payable to such Lender until such time as that Lender has delivered sufficient
evidence of its tax status to the Facility Agent and the Company.

(i) Each Relevant Finance Party shall confirm whether it is entitled to receive payments under the
Relevant Finance Documents free from withholding under FATCA and shall provide any
documentation, forms and other information relating to its status under FATCA reasonably requested
by the Facility Agent or a Borrower sufficient for the Facility Agent and the Borrowers to comply with
their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Relevant Finance Party has complied
with such applicable reporting requirements.

(j) Solely in the case of a Tax Deduction imposed by a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 17 (Taxes):

(i) any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to
payments made by a Borrower under any Relevant Finance Document shall deliver to the
Borrowers and the Facility Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or
the Facility Agent (and promptly after the occurrence of a change in the Lender’s circumstance
requiring a change in the most recent documentation previously delivered), such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Facility
Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
withholding; and

(ii) any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Facility Agent, shall deliver such
other documentation prescribed by an applicable requirement of law or reasonably requested by
the Borrowers or the Facility Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Facility Agent to
determine whether or not such Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation shall not be required if in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any
material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial
position of such Lender. In the event that any Lender fails to comply with the foregoing
requirement, any Borrower shall be permitted to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the
applicable withholding tax (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any withholding tax imposed by
the United Kingdom) estimated in good faith by the Borrowers to be required to be withheld in
respect of interest payable to such Lender. Neither any Parent Entity nor any Obligor is required to
make a Tax Payment to a Lender under paragraphs (c) or (d) above to the extent such taxes are
attributable to a failure by a Lender to provide the documentation required to be delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this Clause 17.2(j) (Lender Tax Status). For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Clause 17.2(j) (Lender Tax Status) shall be understood to affect the rights of
Lenders to a gross-up in respect of a Tax Deduction levied in the United Kingdom, but only to the
extent permitted under Clause 17.1 (Tax Gross-up).

**17.3 Tax Indemnity**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Company shall (within 10 Business Days of written demand by the
Facility Agent) pay (or procure that either the Parent or the relevant Obligor pays) for the account of a
Protected Party an amount equal to any Tax Liability which that Protected Party reasonably determines
has been or will be suffered by that Protected Party (directly or indirectly) in connection with any
Relevant Finance Document. The Protected Party shall within five Business Days’ of request by the
Company provide to the Company reasonable written details explaining the loss, liability or cost and
the calculation of the amount claimed by the Protected Party.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(i) with respect to any Tax Liability of a Protected Party in respect of Tax on Overall Net Income of
that Protected Party;

(ii) to the extent that any Tax Liability has been compensated for by an increased payment or other
payment under paragraphs (c) or (d) of Clause 17.1 (Tax Gross-up) or would have been

AA-88


-----

compensated for by such an increased payment or other payment, but for the application of
paragraph (f) of Clause 17.1 (Tax Gross-up);

(iii) relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;

(iv) to the extent that any Tax Liability has been compensated for by a payment under Clause 37.4
(Stamp Duties) or would have been compensated for by such payment, but for an exception in
such Clause; or

(v) to the extent that any Tax Liability is suffered or incurred by a Finance Party in respect of a Bank
Levy.

(c) A Protected Party making, or intending to make, a claim pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall
promptly notify the Facility Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim together
with supporting evidence, following which the Facility Agent shall notify the Company and provide
such evidence to it.

(d) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from either the Parent or an Obligor under this Clause
17.3 (Tax Indemnity), notify the Facility Agent.

(e) In this Clause 17.3 (Tax Indemnity):

“Tax Liability” means, in respect of any Protected Party:

(i) any liability or any increase in the liability of that person to make any payment of or in respect of
tax;

(ii) any loss of any relief, allowance, deduction or credit in respect of tax which would otherwise have
been available to that person;

(iii) any setting off against income, profits or gains or against any tax liability of any relief, allowance,
deduction or credit in respect of tax which would otherwise have been available to that person;
and

(iv) any loss or setting off against any tax liability of a right to repayment of tax which would
otherwise have been available to that person.

For this purpose, any question of whether or not any relief, allowance, deduction, credit or right to
repayment of tax has been lost or set off in relation to any person, and if so, the date on which that loss
or set off took place, shall be conclusively determined by that person, acting reasonably and in good
faith and such determination shall be binding on the relevant Parties.

“Tax on Overall Net Income” means, in relation to a Protected Party, tax (other than tax deducted or
withheld from any payment) imposed on the net income received or receivable (but not any sum
deemed to be received or receivable) by that Protected Party by the jurisdiction in which the relevant
Relevant Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the
Relevant Finance Party is treated as residing for tax purposes or in which the relevant Relevant Finance
Party’s Facility Office or head office is situated.

**17.4 Tax Credit**

(a) If either the Parent or an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Relevant Finance Party
determines, in its sole opinion, that:

(i) a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment; and

(ii) that Relevant Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,

the Relevant Finance Party shall (subject to paragraph (b) below and to the extent that such Relevant
Finance Party can do so without prejudicing the availability and/or the amount of the Tax Credit and
the right of that Relevant Finance Party to obtain any other benefit, relief or allowance which may be
available to it) pay to either the Parent or the relevant Obligor such amount which that Relevant
Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax
position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Parent or
the relevant Obligor.

(b) Each Relevant Finance Party shall have an absolute discretion as to the time at which and the order and
manner in which it realises or utilises any Tax Credits and shall not be obliged to arrange its business
or its tax affairs in any particular way in order to be eligible for any credit or refund or similar benefit.

AA-89


-----

(c) No Relevant Finance Party shall be obliged to disclose to any other person any information regarding
its business, tax affairs or tax computations (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its
calculations).

(d) If a Relevant Finance Party has made a payment to the Parent or an Obligor pursuant to this Clause
17.4 (Tax Credit) on account of a Tax Credit and it subsequently transpires that Relevant Finance Party
did not receive that Tax Credit, or received a reduced Tax Credit, either the Parent or such Obligor, as
the case may be, shall, on demand, pay to that Relevant Finance Party the amount which that Relevant
Finance Party determines, acting reasonably and in good faith, will put it (after that payment is
received) in the same after-tax position as it would have been in had no such payment or a reduced
payment been made to the Parent or such Obligor.

(e) No Relevant Finance Party shall be obliged to make any payment under this Clause 17.4 (Tax Credit)
if, by doing so, it would contravene the terms of any applicable Law or any notice, direction or
requirement of any governmental or regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law).

**18. INCREASED COSTS**

**18.1 Increased Costs**

Subject to Clause 18.3 (Exceptions), the Company shall, within ten Business Days of a demand by the
Facility Agent, pay (or procure the payment of) for the account of a Relevant Finance Party the amount of
any Increased Cost incurred by that Relevant Finance Party or any of its Affiliates as a result (direct or
indirect) of:

(a) the introduction or implementation of or any change in (or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application of) any Law, regulation, practice or concession or any directive,
requirement, request or guideline (whether or not having the force of law but where such law,
regulation, practice, concession, directive, requirement, request or guideline does not have the force of
law, it is one with which banks or financial institutions subject to the same are generally accustomed to
comply) of any central bank, including the European Central Bank, the Financial Conduct Authority or
any other fiscal, monetary, regulatory or other authority after the Signing Date; or

(b) compliance with any Law, regulation, practice, concession or any such directive, requirement, request
or guideline made after the Signing Date.

**18.2 Increased Costs Claims**

(a) A Relevant Finance Party intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 18.1 (Increased Costs) shall, as
soon as is reasonably practicable after that Relevant Finance Party becomes aware that circumstances
have arisen which entitle it to make such claim, notify the Facility Agent of the event giving rise to the
claim, following which the Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Company.

(b) Each Relevant Finance Party shall, as soon as practicable after a demand by the Facility Agent, provide
a certificate confirming the amount of its, or if applicable, its Affiliate’s Increased Costs and setting out
in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such claim and its calculations in relation to such
Increased Costs.

**18.3 Exceptions**

(a) Clause 18.1 (Increased Costs) does not apply to the extent any Increased Cost is:

(i) attributable to a Tax Deduction required by Law to be made by the Parent or an Obligor, as the
case may be;

(ii) compensated for by Clause 17.3 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have been compensated for by Clause
17.3 (Tax Indemnity) but was not so compensated solely because Clause 17.3(b) (Tax Indemnity)
applied) or because of any failure to complete necessary procedural formalities under Clause
17.2(c) (Lender Tax Status);

(iii) attributable to the gross negligence of or wilful breach by, the Relevant Finance Party or, if
applicable, any of its Affiliates of any law, regulation, practice, concession, directive,
requirement, request or guideline, to which the imposition of such Increased Cost relates;

(iv) suffered by a Relevant Finance Party and in respect of which that Relevant Finance Party intends
to make a claim pursuant to Clause 18.2(a) (Increased Costs Claims), but which is not (and its

Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a Revised Framework” published by the Basel

application or compliance is by a government, regulator, Relevant Finance Party or any of its
Affiliates);

(vi) attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;

(vii) attributable to any Bank Levy but only to the extent that such Bank Levy is no more onerous than
in respect of:

(viii) attributable to the implementation or application of, or compliance with, Basel III or CRD IV or
any law or regulation that implements or applies Basel III or CRD IV to the extent that a Finance
Party knew about or could reasonably be expected to have known about the relevant Increased
Cost on or prior to the date on which it became a Finance Party;

(ix) compensated for by Clause 37.4 (Stamp Duties) or Clause 37.7 (Value added tax) (or would have
been so compensated for under such clause but was not so compensated solely because any of the
exceptions set out therein applied);

net income of the Relevant Finance Party (or any Affiliate of it) or of the branch or office through
which it lends any Advance;

any country or sector borrowing limits or breached any directives imposed upon it;

(xii) attributable to a breach of a Relevant Finance Document by the Relevant Finance Party claiming

(xiii) attributable to the withdrawal (or any vote or referendum electing to withdraw) of any member

**19. ILLEGALITY**

**19.1 Illegality of a Lender**

If at any time after a Lender becomes a Party it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for such
Lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Facility
Document respectively or to make, fund, issue or maintain its participation in any Utilisation or, in the case
of an Ancillary Facility Lender, any utilisation under any Ancillary Facility:

(a) that Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent upon becoming aware of that event;

reduced to zero and cancelled or, if required by the Company, on such date transferred to another bank
or institution willing to accept that transfer; and

(c) upon the Facility Agent notifying the Company, the Company shall procure that each Borrower will, on
such date as the Facility Agent shall have specified (being no earlier than the last day permitted by
law):

accrued interest on and all other amounts owing to that Lender under the Relevant Finance

lawful for such Lender to undertake such transfer); and/or

(ii) repay each amount payable or, as the case may be, provide full cash cover in respect of each
contingent liability under each Ancillary Facility of that Ancillary Facility Lender.

**19.2 Illegality in Relation to an L/C Bank**

met for that next Ratio Period or because the Financial Ratio does not exceed 5.50:1 for that next
Ratio Period), then, the prior breach of such financial covenant or any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall not (or shall be deemed to not) directly or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of
any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Relevant Finance Documents or a
Default or an Event of Default unless the Facility Agent has taken any action under Clause 26.18
(Acceleration Following Financial Ratio Breach) before the delivery of the certificate referred to at
Clause 23.2(b)(ii) (Financial information) in respect of that next Ratio Period.

**22.3 Calculations**

(a) Senior Net Debt or Total Net Debt for any Ratio Period will be calculated by reference to the relevant
financial statements required to be delivered under Clause 23.2 (Financial information).

(b) For the purposes of calculating Annualised EBITDA for any period (or part of any period) or Total
Assets in respect of which the relevant financial information does not include one or more members
of the Bank Group on a consolidated basis, the financial information available for such members of
the Bank Group on an unconsolidated basis for that period (or part of that period) may be used to
calculate Annualised EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) for the Bank Group on a combined
basis.

**22.4 Cure provisions**

(a) The Company may cure a breach of the financial ratio set out in Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio) by
procuring that:

(i) additional equity is injected into, and/or additional Subordinated Funding is provided to,
one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than
the amount which if it had been deducted from Total Net Debt for the Ratio Period in
respect of which the breach arose, would have avoided the breach; or

(ii) additional equity is injected into, and/or additional Subordinated Funding is provided to,
one or more members of the Bank Group in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than
the amount which if it had been added to EBITDA for the Ratio Period in respect of which
the breach arose, would have avoided the breach; or

(iii) Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to
an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any
Ancillary Facility are prepaid (from any source selected by the Company in its sole
discretion) in an amount which if such prepayment had occurred immediately prior to the
calculation on the last day of the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose, the
Financial Ratio Test Condition as at the last day of that Ratio Period would not have been
met and therefore the financial ratio would not have been required to be tested.

(b) A cure under this Clause 22.4 (Cure provisions) will not be effective unless:

(i) in the case of paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, an amount equal to or greater than the
required amount of additional equity or the proceeds of any Subordinated Funding is
received by one or more members of the Bank Group;

(ii) in the case of paragraph (a)(iii) above, the amount of the Revolving Facility Outstandings
and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation to an Additional Facility that is a
revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any Ancillary Facility that are required to
be prepaid are so prepaid,

in each case, within 30 Business Days of delivery of the financial statements delivered under Clause
23.2 (Financial information) which show that Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio) has been breached (the
“Cure Period”).

(c) No cure may be made under this Clause 22.4 (Cure provisions):

(i) in respect of more than five Ratio Periods during the life of the Additional Facilities; or

(ii) in respect of consecutive Ratio Periods.

(d) The Company shall make an election (at its sole discretion) by notice to the Facility Agent prior to the
end of the Cure Period as to whether a breach of the financial ratio set out in Clause 22.2 (Financial
_Ratio) shall be cured pursuant to a recalculation as described in either sub-paragraph (a)(i), (a)(ii) or_
(a)(iii) above.

(e) If the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in sub-paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above, it shall be under no obligation to apply the amount of additional equity or the proceeds of any
Subordinated Funding that are received by one or more members of the Bank Group in prepayment of
the Facilities or for any other specific purpose and such amount will be deemed to be deducted from
Total Net Debt or added to EBITDA for the purposes of Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio) (as applicable)
as at the last day of the relevant Ratio Period.

(f) If the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in sub-paragraph (a)(iii) above, the
amount of the Revolving Facility Outstandings and/or any Additional Facility Outstandings in relation
to an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility and/or net indebtedness under any Ancillary
Facility that are prepaid shall be deemed to be deducted in the calculation of the Financial Ratio Test
Condition for the purposes of Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio) as at the last day of the relevant Ratio
Period.

(g) For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio), the Financial Ratio
Test Condition and the ratio set out in Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio), will be tested or retested, as
applicable, giving effect to the elections and adjustments referred to in paragraph (d), (e) and
(f) above. If, after giving effect to such elections and adjustments, the requirements of Clause 22.2
(Financial Ratio) are met, then the requirements under Clause 22.2 (Financial Ratio) shall be deemed
to have been satisfied as at the relevant original date of determination.

(h) Where a cure is exercised under this Clause 22.4 in respect of a breach of Clause 22.2 (Financial
_Ratio) for any financial quarter and the Company makes an election for a recalculation as described in_
sub-paragraph (a)(ii) above, the amount of additional equity or the proceeds of any Subordinated
Funding that are received by one or more members of the Bank Group shall also be added in
calculating EBITDA for any future Ratio Period that includes such financial quarter. Any adjustments
pursuant to this paragraph will not be treated as a separate cure.

denominated in the same currency as the currency in which that Hedged Debt is denominated or into
which it has been swapped, as described below:

“Hedged Debt” means:

(i) Financial Indebtedness of the Bank Group or the Parent or any other issuer of Parent Debt
originally denominated in any currency other than Sterling in which any member of the
Bank Group or the Parent or any other issuer of Parent Debt earns EBITDA (a functional

exchange hedging transactions, into Sterling; and

(ii) Financial Indebtedness of the Bank Group or the Parent or any other issuer of Parent Debt
that has been swapped, directly or indirectly through one or more foreign exchange hedging
transactions, into a functional currency;

with respect to which substantial steps have been taken, by the Company or any other member of the
Bank Group in connection with any cost reduction synergies or cost savings plan or program or in
connection with any transaction, investment, acquisition, disposition, restructuring, corporate
reorganisation or otherwise (regardless of whether such cost reduction synergies and cost savings
plans or programs could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared);

(b) unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to Annualised EBITDA shall be for the
most recent Ratio Period for which financial statements have been delivered to the Facility Agent
under this Agreement;

(c) EBITDA for the relevant period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
transaction, investment, acquisition, disposition, restructuring, corporate reorganisation or otherwise
occurred on the first day of such period; and

(d) interest on any indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate and that is being given pro forma
effect shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of calculation had been applicable for the

Annualised EBITDA of the person or asset disposed of can never be more than the Remaining
Percentage immediately prior to such disposal.

(d) For the purposes of paragraphs (b)(l), (b)(li) and (c) above:

“Annualised EBITDA and EBITDA” have the meaning given to them in Clause 22.1 (Financial
_definitions) but, when calculating EBITDA in relation to a person or asset that is being (or has been)_
acquired or disposed of, any amounts will be calculated using the methodology for calculating operating
cash flow used in the accounts most recently filed with the SEC by or on behalf of the Ultimate Parent
prior to the date of that acquisition or disposal, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any corporate costs or
allocations paid or payable during the relevant period by a member of the Bank Group which is being
disposed of to one of its Affiliates pursuant to any general services (or similar) arrangement shall be
deducted from the EBITDA of the member of the Bank Group being disposed of.

“Latest Ratio Period” means the most recent Ratio Period for which financial statements have been
delivered pursuant to Clause 23.2 (Financial information).

“Percentage Value” means:

(a) in relation to a disposal, the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group for what was
the Latest Ratio Period at the time of the disposal which is represented by the Annualised EBITDA of
the person or asset disposed of (the “EBITDA Percentage”), after deducting a percentage equal to
the EBITDA Percentage multiplied by the Proportion Repaid; and

(b) in relation to a Reinvestment, the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Bank Group for what
was the Latest Ratio Period at the time of the Reinvestment (but taking into account each disposal
made by the Bank Group after the last day of that Latest Ratio Period and prior to the date of the
relevant Reinvestment) which is represented by the Annualised EBITDA of the person or asset
acquired multiplied by the Proportion Reinvested,

**Where:**

the “Proportion Reinvested” is that proportion of the purchase price for the person or asset acquired
which is represented by the amount of the Net Proceeds of a previous disposal that were reinvested
pursuant to the relevant Reinvestment;

the “Proportion Repaid” is that proportion of the Net Proceeds of that disposal prepaid pursuant to Clause
12.2(a) (Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) and/or repaid pursuant to Clause 11.1 (Voluntary
_Prepayment); and_

AA-116


-----

“Reinvestment” means the reinvestment of all or any part of the Net Proceeds of a previous disposal made
under paragraph (b)(ix) above by the Bank Group after the Signing Date, including in circumstances where
all or any part of such Net Proceeds are distributed as a Permitted Payment and an equity subscription is
subsequently made in, or a Subordinated Funding is subsequently made to, a member of the Bank Group.

(e) Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement or the relevant Security Document, the
Company will not sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its assets which are
subject to a Security Document to which it is a party.

(f) In the event that a transaction (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of a Permitted Disposal and also
meets the criteria of a Permitted Payment, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to
divide and classify such transaction (or a portion thereof) as a disposal permitted under Clause 23.11
(Disposals) and/or a Restricted Payment under Clause 23.14(c) (Restricted Payments).

subparagraphs (C) to (G) below are provided to the Facility Agent within 30 days after
the date on which the merger is entered into;

Subsidiary, the Company has delivered to the Facility Agent within 30 days after the
date on which the merger is entered into, a certificate signed by an authorised signatory
which demonstrates that the ratio of Total Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA will be
equal to, or less than, 5.50:1;

(C) such Merged Entity will be a member of the Bank Group and will be liable for the
obligations of the relevant Original Entities (including the obligations under this
Agreement and the Security Documents), which obligations remain unaffected by the
merger, and entitled to the benefit of all rights of such Original Entities;

(D) (if all or any part of the share capital of any of the relevant Original Entities was
charged pursuant to a Security Document) the equivalent part of the issued share
capital of such Merged Entity is charged pursuant to a Security Document on terms of
at least an equivalent nature and equivalent ranking as any Security Document relating
to the shares in each relevant Original Entity within 60 days of the merger;

AA-117


-----

(E) such Merged Entity has entered into Security Documents (if applicable) within 60 days
of the merger which provide security over the same assets of at least an equivalent
nature and ranking to the security provided by the relevant Original Entities pursuant to
any Security Documents entered into by them;

(F) any possibility of the Security Documents referred to in subparagraphs (D) or (E)
above being challenged or set aside is not materially greater than any such possibility
in relation to the Security Documents entered into by, or in respect of the share capital
of, any relevant Original Entity; and

(G) all the property and other assets of the relevant Original Entities are vested in the
Merged Entity and the Merged Entity has assumed all the rights and obligations of the
relevant Original Entities under any, material Necessary Authorisations and Licences
and other licences or registrations (to the extent reasonably necessary for the business
of the relevant Original Entities) granted in favour of the Original Entities under
Telecommunications and Cable Laws and/or all such rights and obligations have been
transferred to the Merged Entity and/or the relevant Necessary Authorisations and
Licences and other licences or registrations (to the extent reasonably necessary for the
business of the relevant Original Entities) granted in favour of the Original Entities
under Telecommunications and Cable Laws have been reissued to the Merged Entity,

except that the requirements of paragraphs (C) to (G) above will not apply in respect of
any merger between Original Entities:

(1) both of which are not Obligors; and

(2) neither one of which is party to a Security Document, neither one of whose share
capital is charged pursuant to a Security Document and neither one of whom owes
any receivables to another member of the Bank Group which are pledged pursuant
to a Security Document; or

(v) in the event that the relevant member of the Bank Group liquidates or dissolves in
accordance with the provisions of Clause 23.31 (Internal Reorganisations).

over assets in accordance with the 80% Security Test, each in favour of the Security Trustee

**23.34 Intentionally Left Blank**

**23.35 Limited Condition Transaction**

(a) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no
Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such
action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Company, be deemed satisfied, so long
as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreement (or other
relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Company has exercised its option under the first sentence of this
paragraph (a) and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the date of such definitive
agreement for a Limited Condition Transaction is entered into prior to the consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have
occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection
with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted under this Agreement.

(b) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the
calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the ratio of Senior Net Debt to Annualised
EBITDA or Total Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA, or testing baskets set forth in this Agreement
including baskets measured as a percentage or multiple, as applicable, of Total Assets or Annualised
EBITDA, in each case, at the option of the Company (Company’s election to exercise such option in
connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination
of whether such action is permitted under this Agreement shall be deemed to be the date of the
definitive agreement (or other relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition
Transaction is entered into (the “LCT Test Date”) provided that the Company shall be entitled to
subsequently elect, in its sole discretion, the date of consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction instead of the LCT Test Date as the applicable date of determination and if, after giving
pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof), as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, a Permitted Affiliate Parent or any member of the Bank Group could have
taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the relevant ratio, test or basket,
such ratio, test or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.

(c) If the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which
compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Annualised EBITDA or Total Assets,
of the Company, a Permitted Affiliate Parent and any member of the Bank Group or the person or
assets subject to the Limited Condition Transaction (as if each reference to the Company or a member

AA-137


-----

of the Bank Group in such definitions was to such person or assets) at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant transaction or action, such ratios, tests or basket amounts will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited
Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, test or basket
availability under this Agreement on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier
of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the definitive agreement
for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any incurrence of Financial Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been
consummated.

**23.36 Group Redesignation**

The Company may at any time deliver a notice (a “Group Redesignation Notice”) to the Facility Agent
designating any Holding Company of the Company and/or any Holding Company of any Permitted
Affiliate Parent as a “New Group Topco” for the purposes of this Agreement, provided that, taking into
account any actions to be taken by the Company for the benefit of the Lenders, it would not be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Lenders in the opinion of the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).

**23.37 Ratings Trigger**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Finance Document, during
the period (if any) that a Release Condition (as defined in paragraph (d) below) is satisfied:

(i) the following obligations and restrictions shall be suspended and shall not apply:

Quarter Dates in each financial year and the Financial Ratio Test Condition will only apply
to such second and fourth Quarter Dates;

(iii) the relevant Margin payable on any utilisation under the Revolving Facility, (to the extent
specified in the relevant Additional Facility Accession Deed for that Additional Facility) an
Additional Facility Advance or Unpaid Sum (as applicable) will be reduced by 0.50 per
cent. per annum; and

(iv) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific
amount is set out in this Agreement and any definitions used therein (including all “annual”,
“life of Facilities” and “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by 50 per
cent.

(b) If at any time after a Release Condition has been satisfied and a Release Condition subsequently
ceases to be satisfied, any breach of this Agreement or any other Finance Document that arises as a
result of any of the obligations, restrictions or other terms referred to in paragraph (a) above ceasing
to be suspended or amended shall not (provided that it did not constitute an Event of Default at the
time the relevant event or occurrence took place) constitute (or result in) a breach of any term of this
Agreement or any other Finance Documents, a Default or an Event of Default.

(c) In respect of any amount which has not been applied in mandatory prepayment of the Facilities in
accordance with Clause 12 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation) as a result of the Release
Condition being satisfied (the “Released Amounts”), if the Release Condition subsequently ceases to
be satisfied after the date the prepayment would have been required had the Release Condition not
been satisfied, the failure to apply the Released Amounts in prepayment shall not result in a breach of
any term of this Agreement or any other Finance Document.

(d) For the purposes of this Clause 23.37 the “Release Condition” means the Facilities or the Company
receive any two of the following:

(i) a rating of “Baa3” (or the equivalent) or higher from Moody’s or any of its successors or
assigns;

(ii) a rating of “BBB-” (or the equivalent) or higher from Standard & Poor’s or any of its
successors or assigns; and/or

(iii) a rating of “BBB-” (or the equivalent) or higher from Fitch or any of its successors or
assigns,

in each case, with a “stable outlook” from such rating agency.

purposes of, any litigation, arbitration, administrative or other investigations, proceedings or

Facility Agent or the relevant Borrower or Obligor, as the case may be, it is not practicable
to do so in the circumstances; and

(iv) any person with the consent of the relevant Lender or Reference Bank or Alternative

therefor in accordance with the provisions of Clause 32 (Payments) or if any sum due and payable by an
Obligor pursuant to a judgment of any court in connection with this Agreement is not paid on the date of
such judgment, the period beginning on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of such judgment
and ending on the Business Day on which the obligation of such Obligor to pay the Unpaid Sum is
discharged shall be divided into successive periods, each of which (other than the first) shall start on the

shall (except as otherwise provided in this Clause 27 (Default Interest)) be selected by the Facility Agent.

**27.2 Default Rate**

During each such period relating thereto as is mentioned in Clause 27.1 (Consequences of Non-Payment)
an Unpaid Sum shall bear interest at the rate per annum which is the sum from time to time of one per cent,
the Margin (provided that if any Unpaid Sum is not directly referable to a particular Facility the Margin
shall be the Revolving Facility Margin) and EURIBOR or LIBOR, as the case may be, on the Quotation
Date therefor, provided that if such Unpaid Sum is all or part of an Advance which became due and
payable on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period or Term relating thereto, the first Interest
Period or Term applicable to it shall be of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of that Interest Period
or Term and the rate of interest applicable thereto from time to time during such Interest Period or Term

Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 27.2 (Default Rate) in respect of an Unpaid Sum shall

Obligor.

“Advance” includes any Unpaid Sum and the term “Interest Period” and “Term”, in relation to an Unpaid

sums in or towards the discharge of such liabilities owed to it by such other Obligor or Hedging Obligors
under the Relevant Finance Documents as such Relevant Finance Party may select provided that such
Relevant Finance Party shall promptly make such application upon receiving sums sufficient to discharge

Relevant Finance Parties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the guarantee under this Clause 28
(Guarantee and Indemnity)) hereby irrevocably agrees that its obligations under this Clause 28 (Guarantee
_and Indemnity) shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum_
amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Restricted Guarantor that are relevant
under such laws, and after giving effect to any rights to contribution pursuant to any agreement providing

by that US Guarantor and the transactions contemplated by the Relevant Finance
Documents.

(c) Each US Guarantor represents and warrants to each Relevant Finance Party that:

Documents) is less than the aggregate value (being the lesser of fair valuation and present
fair saleable value) of its assets;

(ii) its capital is not unreasonably small to carry on its business as it is being conducted;

(iii) it has not incurred and does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they
mature; and

irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by
each other Obligor to honor all of its obligations under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause
28 (Guarantee and Indemnity) in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified
ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Clause 28.11 (Keepwell) for the maximum amount of
such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Clause 28.11
(Keepwell), or otherwise under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause 28 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity), voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, or_
otherwise, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under
this Clause 28.11 (Keepwell) shall remain in full force and effect until the obligations under the
Relevant Finance Documents are discharged in full. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this
Clause 28.11 (Keepwell) constitutes, and this Clause 28.11 (Keepwell) shall be deemed to constitute, a
“keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Obligor for all purposes of
Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Obligation, each Obligor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant guarantee
or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or
such other person as constitutes an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act
or any regulations promulgated thereunder and can cause another person to qualify as an “eligible
contract participant” at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the

waived.

(b) Any right which at any time any Guarantor may have under the existing or future laws of Jersey
whether by virtue of the droit de division or otherwise to require that any liability under any guarantee
or indemnity given in or in connection with any Relevant Finance Document be divided or

acting through its Facility Office unless it has received not less than five Business Days prior notice from

Document;

(d) the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information provided by the Facility Agent, the

If any amount is due and payable by any party to the Facility Agent under any Relevant Finance Document
the Facility Agent may, after giving notice to that party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from
any payment to that party which the Facility Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Relevant
Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the
purposes of the Relevant Finance Documents that party shall be regarded as having received such payment
without any such deduction.

(a) The Parent and each Obligor (other than the Company) irrevocably authorises the Company to act on
its behalf as its agent in relation to the Relevant Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises:

and otherwise to the relevant persons contemplated under this Agreement and to give all
notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests), to
execute on its behalf any Relevant Finance Document and to enter into any agreement in
connection with the Relevant Finance Documents notwithstanding that the same may affect
the Parent or such Obligor, without further reference to or the consent of the Parent or such
Obligor; and

(ii) each Relevant Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to be given
to or served on the Parent or such Obligor pursuant to the Relevant Finance Documents to
the Company on its behalf,

and in each such case the Parent or such Obligor will be bound thereby as though the Parent or such
Obligor itself had supplied such information, given such notice and instructions, executed such
Relevant Finance Document and agreement or received any such notice, demand or other
communication and each Relevant Finance Party may rely on any action purported to be taken by the
Company on behalf of that Obligor.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, notice or other communication given
or made by the Obligors’ Agent under any Relevant Finance Document, or in connection with this
Agreement (whether or not known to the Parent or any other Obligor, as the case may be, and whether
occurring before or after such person became party to this Agreement), shall be binding for all
purposes on the Parent and all other Obligors as if the Parent or the other Obligors had expressly
made, given or concurred with the same. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other
communications of the Obligors’ Agent and the Parent or any other Obligor, those of the Obligors’
Agent shall prevail.

(c) If (notwithstanding the fact that the guarantees granted under this Agreement are, and the Security is,
intended to guarantee and secure, respectively, all obligations arising under the Relevant Finance
Documents), any guarantee or Security does not automatically extend from time to time to any
(however fundamental and of whatsoever nature and whether or not more onerous) amendment,
variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Relevant Finance Documents and/or any

(a) Each Lender and each Obligor will co-operate with the Facility Agent to complete any legal
requirements imposed on the Facility Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under
this Agreement and shall supply any information requested by the Facility Agent in connection with
the proper performance of those duties provided that neither the Parent nor any Obligor shall be under
any obligation to provide any information the supply of which would be contrary to any
confidentiality obligation binding on any member of the Group or prejudice the retention of legal
privilege in such information and provided further that neither the Parent nor any Obligor shall (and
the Company shall procure that no member of the Bank Group shall) be able to deny the Facility
Agent any such information by reason of it having entered into a confidentiality undertaking which
would prevent it from disclosing, or be able to claim any legal privilege in respect of, any financial
information relating to itself or the Group.

(b) Any Lender may by notice to the Facility Agent appoint a person to receive on its behalf all notices,
communications, information and documents to be made or dispatched to that Lender under the

(Electronic Communication)) electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable
the sending and receipt of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or officer, if
any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and be treated as a notification of a substitute
address, fax number, electronic mail address (or such other information), department and officer by
that Lender for the purposes of Clause 39.2 (Giving of Notice) and Clause 39.5(a)(iii) (Electronic

not actually received such sum, then the person to whom such sum (or the proceeds of such exchange
contract) was (or were) so made available shall on request refund the same to the Facility Agent together

with a view to agreeing with the Company such changes to the operation or administration of the
Facilities as the Facility Agent may deem reasonably necessary in the circumstances;

Agreement, interest is payable on such amount at the rate payable on the original due date.

may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the
purpose of the set-off.

(b) Any credit balances taken into account by an Ancillary Facility Lender when operating a net limit in

amount to a payment due under the Relevant Finance Documents then:

(a) the Recovering Relevant Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt
or recovery to the Facility Agent;

(b) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the
Recovering Relevant Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or
made by the Facility Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 32.5 (Partial Payments),
without taking account of any tax which would be imposed on the Facility Agent in relation to the
receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(c) the Recovering Relevant Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Facility
Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the “Sharing Payment”) equal to such receipt or
recovery less any amount which the Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering
Relevant Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 32.5
(Partial Payments).

**34.2 Redistribution of Payments**

The Facility Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the Parent or the relevant
Obligor and shall distribute it between the Relevant Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Relevant
Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 32.5 (Partial Payments).

**34.3 Recovering Relevant Finance Party’s Rights**

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under Clause 34.2 (Redistribution of Payments), of a payment
received by a Recovering Relevant Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant Obligor and the

treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

**34.4 Reversal of Redistribution**

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Relevant Finance Party becomes
repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Relevant Finance Party, then:

Clause 34.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall, upon the request of the Facility Agent, pay to the
Facility Agent for account of that Recovering Relevant Finance Party an amount equal to its share of
the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Relevant
Finance Party for its share of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Relevant
Finance Party is required to pay); and

(b) that Recovering Relevant Finance Party’s rights of subrogation in respect of any reimbursement shall
be cancelled and the Parent or the relevant Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing Relevant Finance
Party for the amount so reimbursed.

**34.5 Exceptions**

(a) This Clause 34 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties) shall not apply to the extent that the
Recovering Relevant Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause 34
(Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties), have a valid and enforceable claim against the Parent
or the relevant Obligor.

(b) A Recovering Relevant Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Relevant Finance Party
under this Clause 34 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties), any amount which the
Recovering Relevant Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration
proceedings, if:

(i) it notified such other Relevant Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

(ii) such other Relevant Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or
arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received
notice of it or did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

**34.6 Ancillary Facility Lenders**

(a) This Clause 34 (Sharing among the Relevant Finance Parties) shall not apply to any receipt or
recovery by a Lender in its capacity as an Ancillary Facility Lender at any time prior to service of

_Relevant Finance Parties) shall apply to all receipts or recoveries by Ancillary Facility Lenders_
except to the extent that the receipt or recovery represents a reduction from the Designated Gross
Amount for an Ancillary Facility to its Designated Net Amount.

**34.7 Contractual recognition of bail-in**

Notwithstanding any other term of any Relevant Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement
or understanding between the Parties, each Party acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any Party
to any other Party under or in connection with the Relevant Finance Documents may be subject to Bail-In
Action by the relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of:

(a) any Bail-In Action in relation to any such liability, including:

(i) a reduction, in full or in part, in the principal amount, or outstanding amount due (including
any accrued but unpaid interest) in respect of any such liability;

(ii) a conversion of all, or part of, any such liability into shares or other instruments of
ownership that may be issued to, or conferred on, it; and

any Bail-In Action in relation to any such liability.

**34.8 QFC Credit Support**

(a) To the extent that the Relevant Finance Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise,
for any Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC
**Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the Parties acknowledge and agree as**
follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution
**Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below**
applicable notwithstanding that the Relevant Finance Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact
be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other
state of the United States):

(i) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”)
becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of
such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and

AA-163


-----

obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in
property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered
Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any
such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of
a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
Default Rights under the Relevant Finance Documents that might otherwise apply to such
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered
Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be
exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Relevant
Finance Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United
States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the Parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights
of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 34.8, the following terms have the following meanings:

“BHC Act Affiliate” of a Party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in
accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such Party.

“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in,
and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined
in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with,
12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.

“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted
in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).

Reference Bank or in respect of any act or omission of any kind by that officer, employee or agent in
relation to any Finance Document, or to any Reference Bank Quotation, and any officer, employee or
agent of each Base Reference Bank or Alternative Reference Bank may rely on this Clause 35.3

Facility;

(B) which would result in it or the proposed assignee or transferee holding an aggregate
participation of more than zero but less than £1,000,000 (or its equivalent as at the date
of such assignment or transfer) in the Facilities, save that an assignment or transfer
may be made to or by a trust, fund or other non-bank entity which customarily

assignment or transfer shall be permitted to settle or otherwise become effective within the period of

avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or
waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with

accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 36.4 (Assignments or Transfers by Lenders) there shall

and remains liable under the Relevant Finance Documents for any such obligation;

(b) such Lender retains exclusive control over all rights and obligations in relation to the participations
and Commitments that are the subject of the relevant agreement or arrangement, including all voting
rights (for the avoidance of doubt, free of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which it is
required to or will consult with any other person in relation to the exercise of any such rights and/or
obligations), unless:

(i) the proposed sub-participant is a person to whom the relevant rights and obligations could
have been assigned or transferred in accordance with the terms of this Clause 36; and

(ii) prior to entering into the relevant agreement or arrangement, the relevant Lender provides
the Company with full details of that proposed sub-participant and any voting, consultation
or other rights to be granted to the sub-participant;

(c) the relationship between the Lender and the proposed sub-participant is that of a contractual debtor
and creditor (including in the bankruptcy or similar event of the Lender or an Obligor);

of the Relevant Finance Documents or in any monies received by the relevant Lender under or in
relation to this Agreement or any of the Relevant Finance Documents (in its capacity as
sub-participant under that arrangement); and

(e) the proposed sub-participant will under no circumstances: (i) be subrogated to, or be substituted in
respect of, the relevant Lender’s claims under this Agreement or any of the Relevant Finance
Documents; or (ii) otherwise have any contractual relationship with, or rights against, the Obligors
under or in relation to this Agreement or any of the Relevant Finance Documents (in its capacity as
sub-participant under that arrangement).

**36.6 Sub-participant Register**

(a) In the case of a Sub-participation (in each case, other than any non-voting derivatives (which are not
participations) which would otherwise be caught by the definition of “Sub-participation”), the person
granting the Sub-participation (or similar right) shall, acting solely for these purposes as non-fiduciary
agent for the Borrower, maintain a register (a “Sub-Participant Register”) on which it enters the
name and address of each sub-participant (or person holding the similar right) and the Commitment
and obligations (including principal and stated interest) in which each sub-participant (or other
person) has an interest or obligation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, including without limitation Clause 35
(Calculations and Accounts), the entries in the Sub- Participant Register shall be conclusive (absent

AA-168

manifest error), and such person maintaining the Sub-Participant Register shall treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Sub-Participant Register as the owner of such Sub-participation (or
similar right) for all purposes under the Relevant Finance Documents notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary.

(c) Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Clause 36, no Lender shall have any obligation to
disclose all or any portion of the Sub-Participant Register to any person (including the identity of any
sub-participant or any information relating to a sub-participant’s interest in any Advance,
Commitments or other obligations under any Relevant Finance Documents) except to the extent that
such disclosure to a tax authority is necessary to establish that such Advance, Commitment or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or
is otherwise required thereunder.

**36.7 Assignments**

(a) Unless such assignment or transfer is effected by a Transfer Agreement pursuant to Clause 36.9
(Transfer Agreements), if any Lender wishes to assign all or any of its rights and benefits under the
Relevant Finance Documents, unless and until the relevant assignee has agreed with the other
Relevant Finance Parties that it shall be under the same obligations towards each of them as it would
have been under if it had been an original party to the Relevant Finance Documents as a Lender, such
assignment shall not become effective and the other Relevant Finance Parties shall not be obliged to
recognise such assignee as having the rights against each of them which it would have had if it had
been such a party to this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting any right or discretion of the Facility Agent under the Relevant Finance Documents,
the Facility Agent may in its discretion stop processing assignments or transfers under this Clause 36
(Assignments and Transfers) when a notice of prepayment has been received by it under this
Agreement, for a period of five Business Days prior to the date the prepayment is required or
expected to be made.

**36.8 Transfer Deed**

(a) If any Lender wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and/or obligations under the Relevant
Finance Documents, such transfer may be effected by novation through the delivery to the Facility

benefits and/or obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents may also be effected through the
delivery to the Facility Agent of a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Agreement in
accordance with Clause 36.9 (Transfer Agreements).

(b) The Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement delivered
to it pursuant to paragraph (a) above, upon its satisfaction with the results of all “know your client” or
other applicable anti-money laundering checks relating to the identity of any person that it is required
to carry out in relation to such New Lender.

(c) Upon its execution of the Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) above on
the later of the Transfer Date specified in such Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement and the fifth
Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Facility Agent on such Transfer
Deed or Transfer Agreement falling on or after) the date of execution of such Transfer Deed or
Transfer Agreement by the Facility Agent:

(i) to the extent that in such Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement the Lender party to it seeks
to transfer its rights, benefits and obligations under the Relevant Finance Documents, the
Parent, each of the Obligors and such Lender shall be released from further obligations
towards one another under the Relevant Finance Documents to that extent and their
respective rights against one another shall be cancelled to that extent (such rights and
obligations being referred to in this Clause 36.8 (Transfer Deed) as “discharged rights and
**obligations”);**

(ii) the Parent, each of the Obligors and the New Lender party to it shall assume obligations
towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
discharged rights and obligations only insofar as the Parent, such Obligor and such New
Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of the Parent, such Obligor and
such Lender;

AA-169


-----

(iii) the other Relevant Finance Parties and the New Lender shall acquire the same rights and
benefits and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired
and assumed had such New Lender been an original party to the Relevant Finance
Documents as a Lender with the rights, benefits and obligations acquired or assumed by it

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and

Finance Documents.

**36.19 Pro rata Interest Settlement**

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a “pro rata
basis” to Transferors and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 36.8 (Transfer

(i) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for
the account of the Transferor; and

(ii) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for
the application of this Clause 36.19 (Pro rata Interest Settlement), have been payable to it
on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

The Facility Agent shall, within 10 Business Days of receiving a notice relating to an assignment pursuant

request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote under the Relevant Finance
Documents such Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; and

(d) an Advance (or part of an Advance) not being prepaid in accordance with a notice of prepayment
given by a Borrower.

**37.6 Indemnity to the Facility Agent**

Relevant Finance Party to any Obligor under any Relevant Finance Document (whether that supply is
taxable pursuant to the exercise of an option or otherwise), the relevant Relevant Finance Party shall
provide a VAT invoice to the Obligor and that Obligor shall pay to that Relevant Finance Party (in

Finance Party for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be)

entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

AA-175


-----

party other than the Recipient (the “Subject Party”) is required by the terms of any Relevant Finance
Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than
being required to reimburse the Recipient in respect of that consideration), such party shall also pay to
the Supplier (in addition to and at the same time as paying such amount) an amount equal to the
amount of such VAT. The Recipient will promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any
credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient
reasonably determines is in respect of such VAT.

other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

(b) does not materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of Lenders in respect of any other
Utilisation or Facility,

may be made in accordance with this Clause 42 (Amendments) but as if references in this Clause 42
(Amendments) to the specified proportion of Lenders (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each affected

be proper to make provided that the Facility Agent is of the opinion that such modification:

(i) would not be materially prejudicial to the position of any Lender and in the opinion of the
Facility Agent such modification is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is to correct a
manifest error;

(ii) relates to the increase in the principal amount of a Commitment of a Lender in relation to
any Facility and such increased Commitment has been requested by the Company to fund
any original issue discount required to be paid to that Lender in relation to that Facility
under any Finance Document;

(iii) is of a minor, operational or technical nature; or

(iv) any amendment which relates to the implementation of any alternative basis for the
calculation of interest that is binding on all Parties in accordance with paragraph (c) of
Clause 15.4 (Cost of Funds).

(b) Any such modification shall be made on such terms as the Facility Agent may determine, shall be
binding upon the Lenders, and shall be notified by the Company to the Lenders as soon as practicable
thereafter.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 42 (Amendments) or in any Finance Document, an
amendment or waiver of Clauses 22.2 (Financial Ratio) to Clause 22.4 (Cure Provisions) and Clause
26.20 (Revolving Facility Acceleration) shall be made only with the consent of the Company and the
Composite Revolving Facility Instructing Group and shall not require the consent or approval of any
other Finance Party.

**42.6 Guarantees and Security**

A waiver of issuance or the release of any Guarantor from any of its obligations under Clause 28
(Guarantee and Indemnity) or a release of any Security under the Security Documents, in each case, other
than in accordance with the terms of any Relevant Finance Document shall require the prior written
consent of affected Lenders whose Available Commitments plus Outstandings amount in aggregate to
more than 75 per cent. of the Available Facilities plus aggregate Outstandings. This Clause may not be
amended without the consent of Lenders whose Available Commitments plus Outstandings amount in
aggregate to more than 75 per cent. of the Available Facilities plus aggregate Outstandings.

**42.7 Release of Guarantees and Security**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, at the time of completion of any disposal by the Parent, any Obligor
or any other provider of Security of any shares, assets, rights or revenues the Security Trustee shall

AA-179


-----

(and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the request of and cost of the
relevant Obligor, execute such documents as may be required to:

(i) release those shares, assets, rights or revenues from Security constituted by any relevant
Security Document or certify that any floating charge constituted by any relevant Security
Documents over such shares, assets, revenues or rights has not crystallised; and

(ii) release any person which as a result of that disposal, ceases to be the Parent or any Obligor,
from any guarantee, indemnity or Security Document to which it is a party and its other
obligations under any other Relevant Finance Document.

(b) The Security Trustee shall only be required under paragraph (a) above to grant the release of any
Security or to deliver a certificate of non-crystallisation on account of a disposal as described in that
paragraph if:

(i) the disposal is (A) permitted under Clause 23.11 (Disposals), (B) as a result of, or in
connection with, any solvent liquidation or dissolution that complies with Clause 23.31
(Internal Reorganisation) or (C) the consent of the Instructing Group has been obtained;
and

(ii) to the extent that the disposal is to be in exchange for replacement assets the Security
Trustee has either received (or is satisfied, acting reasonably, that it will receive within 60
days of the date of the disposal) one or more duly executed Security Documents granting
Security over those replacement assets or is satisfied, acting reasonably, that the
replacement assets will be subject to Security pursuant to any existing Security Documents.

(c) If at any time the Obligors at the relevant time represent a percentage which is greater than that
required to satisfy the 80% Security Test and the Company provides a certificate to the Facility Agent
certifying that upon the release of one or more specified Obligors from its obligations under this
Agreement the 80% Security Test would continue to be satisfied, the Security Trustee shall (and it is
hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the request and cost of the Company,
execute such documents as may be required to release such specified Obligors from any guarantees,
indemnities and/or Security Documents to which it is a party and to release it from its other
obligations under any Relevant Finance Document, provided however that suspension of the
provisions of paragraph (b) of Clause 23.26 (Further Assurance) pursuant to Clause 23.37 (Ratings
_Trigger) shall not by itself permit a release pursuant to this paragraph (c). Any Obligor, whose assets_
are to be released by this paragraph (c) or any other provision of this Agreement or the Relevant
Finance Documents and who as a result will not have granted security over its assets in accordance
with the 80% Security Test for the benefit of the Relevant Finance Parties, shall, for purposes of the
determination of the 80% Security Test, not be treated as an Obligor for the calculation in the
preceding sentence and on a going forward basis. The release provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not
permit any release of any guarantees or Security in favour of the Relevant Finance Parties, in each
case, granted by the Parent, the Company and any Borrower (other than the Company) for as long as
such entity is a Borrower.

(d) The Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties to) at the
cost of the relevant Obligor, execute such documents as may be required or desirable to effect any
release (i) permitted under clause 10.2 (Releases) and clause 10.3 (Release of Obligors), in each case,
of the Security Trust Agreement, (ii) to which a prior written consent of the relevant Lenders has been
granted in accordance with Clause 42.6 (Guarantees and Security), (iii) required to permit the
granting of any Security Interest permitted under Clause 23.8 (Negative pledge), (iv) expressly
permitted under the Relevant Finance Documents (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to
any consent obtained from the Instructing Group), (v) in connection with any Permitted Transaction
(other than a Permitted Transaction pursuant to paragraph (a) or (j) of that definition) or (vi) if it is
necessary or desirable in connection with Clause 23.31 (Internal Reorganisation).

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may require the Security
Trustee to, and the Security Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance
Parties to) at the cost of the relevant Obligor, execute such documents as may be required or desirable
to effect the release of the Security granted over any asset of an Obligor pursuant to the Security
Documents to which it is a party to enable the relevant Obligor to grant in connection with that asset
any encumbrance permitted under Clause 23.8 (Negative pledge). If, immediately prior to such release
the relevant Obligor was treated as an Obligor for the purpose of the 80% Security Test, the relevant
Obligor shall continue to be treated as an Obligor for those purposes notwithstanding any such
release.

AA-180

**42.8 Asset Security Release**

(a) Following receipt by the Lenders of the Lender Asset Security Release Confirmation, the Security
Trustee shall (and it is hereby authorised by the other Relevant Finance Parties (including, if
applicable, in their capacities as Hedge Counterparties (under and as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)) to) be irrevocably authorised by the
Lenders to execute such documents as may be required to ensure that the Security (other than any
Security required to be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is
released.

(b) The Lenders shall procure that any of their Affiliates that are Hedge Counterparties (under and as
defined in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement) shall, at the
request of the Company at any time, enter into all documentation that is necessary or desirable to
ensure that, subject to obtaining the consent to the extent necessary of any applicable party to the
Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement that is not a Party (or an
Affiliate of a Party that is a Hedge Counterparty (under and as defined in the Group Intercreditor
Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement)) the Security (other than any Security required to
be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is released.

**42.9 Amendments Affecting the Facility Agent**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Facility Agent shall not be obliged to agree to
any amendment, consent or waiver if the same would:

(a) amend or waive any provision of Clause 29 (Role of the Facility Agent, the Arrangers, the L/C Banks
_and Others), Clause 36.12 (Disclosure of Information), Clause 37 (Costs and Expenses) or this Clause_
42 (Amendments); or

(b) otherwise amend or waive any of the Facility Agent’s rights under this Agreement or subject the
Facility Agent to any additional obligations under this Agreement.

**42.10 Calculation of Consent**

Where a request for a waiver of, or an amendment to, any provision of any Relevant Finance Document
has been sent by the Facility Agent to the Lenders at the request of an Obligor:

(a) each Lender that does not respond to such request for waiver or amendment within 10 Business Days
after receipt by it of such request (or within such other period as the Facility Agent and the Company
shall specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in determining whether the requisite level of
consent to such waiver or amendment was granted; and

(b) the Facility Agent, in determining whether sufficient Lenders have consented to that amendment or
waiver, shall not take into account any Commitments or Advances under any relevant Facility in
relation to which a cancellation or prepayment notice (as applicable) has been served in accordance
with Clause 10.1 (Voluntary Cancellation) or Clause 11.1 (Voluntary Prepayment) provided that to
the extent that any cancellation or prepayment is not made on the date specified in a relevant
cancellation or prepayment notice then the requirement to take into account any such Commitments or
Advances under any relevant Facility shall be reinstated with retroactive effect from the date of
delivery of such cancellation or prepayment notice.

**42.11 Reference Banks and Alternative Reference Banks**

An amendment and waiver which relates to the rights and obligations of a Reference Bank or an
Alternative Reference Bank (each in their capacity as such) may not be effected without the consent of that
Reference Bank or that Alternative Reference Bank, as the case may be.

**42.12 Replacement of Screen Rate**

If any Screen Rate is not available for a currency which can be selected for an Advance, any amendment or
waiver which relates to providing for another benchmark rate to apply in relation to that currency in place
of that Screen Rate (or which relates to aligning any provision of a Relevant Finance Document to use that
other benchmark rate) may be made with the consent of the Instructing Group and the Company.

AA-181


-----

**42.13 Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders**

(a) In ascertaining the Instructing Group, affected Lenders, all Lenders or any other class of Lenders (as
applicable) or whether any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of any
of the Commitments has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or
other vote under the Relevant Finance Documents, a Defaulting Lender’s Commitments and
participations will be deemed to be zero.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 42.13 (Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders), the Facility Agent
may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:

(i) any Lender which has notified the Facility Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender;
and

(ii) any Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or circumstances referred
to in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of “Defaulting Lender” has occurred,

unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting
evidence reasonably requested by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent is otherwise aware that the
Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

**42.14 Replacement of Lenders**

(a) If at any time:

(i) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender; or

(ii) any Lender becomes a Non-Funding Lender,

then the Company may, on not less than three Business Days prior notice to the Facility Agent and
that Lender (A), replace that Lender by requiring it to (and that Lender shall) transfer all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to a Lender or other person selected by the Company for a
purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender’s share in the outstanding
Advances and all accrued interest and fees and other amounts payable to it under this Agreement or
(B) prepay that Lender all but not part of its share in its outstanding Advances and all accrued interest
and fees and other amounts payable to it under this Agreement from cash flow, permitted
Subordinated Funding or New Equity received by the Bank Group. Any notice delivered under this
paragraph (a) shall be accompanied by a Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement complying with
Clause 36 (Assignments and Transfers), which Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement shall be
immediately executed by the relevant Non-Consenting Lender or, as the case may be, Non-Funding
Lender and returned to the Company. If a Lender does not execute and/or return a Transfer Deed or
Transfer Agreement as required by this paragraph (a) within two Business Days of delivery by the
Company, the Facility Agent shall execute (and is hereby irrevocably authorised by the relevant
Lender to do so) that Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement on behalf of such Lender.

(b) The Company shall have no right to replace the Arrangers, the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee
and none of the foregoing nor shall any Lender have any obligation to the Company to find a
replacement Lender or other such person.

(c) In no event shall the Lender being replaced be required to pay or surrender to such replacement
Lender or other person any of the fees received by such Lender being replaced pursuant to this
Agreement.

**42.15 Screen Rate**

If any Screen Rate is not available for a currency which can be selected for an Advance, any amendment or
waiver which relates to providing for another benchmark rate to apply in relation to that currency in place
of that Screen Rate (or which relates to aligning any provision of a Relevant Finance Document to the use
of that other benchmark rate) may be made with the consent of the Facility Agent (acting in its sole
discretion and, for the avoidance of doubt, without any requirement to consult with or seek any consent or
instruction from the Lenders or any other Finance Party) and the Company.

**42.16 Ancillary Facilities**

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility Document shall require the consent of any
Relevant Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Facility Lender.

AA-182


-----

**43.** **THIRD PARTY RIGHTS**

(a) A person which is not a Party (a “third party”) shall have no right to enforce any of its provisions
except that:

(i) a third party shall have those rights it would have had if the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 had not come into effect; and

(ii) each of Clause 17.3 (Tax Indemnity), Clause 18 (Increased Costs) and Clause 29.9
(Exclusion of Liability) shall be enforceable by any third party referred to in such clause as
if such third party were a Party.

(b) Subject to Clause 42.11 (Reference Banks and Alternative Reference Banks) but otherwise
notwithstanding any term of any Finance Documents, the consent of any third party is not required to
rescind or vary this Agreement at any time.

**44.** **COUNTERPARTS**

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and all of such counterparts taken together
shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

**45.** **GOVERNING LAW**

This Agreement, including all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, English Law.

**46.** **JURISDICTION**

**46.1 Courts**

Each of the Parties (other than the US Borrower) irrevocably agrees for the benefit of each of the Relevant
Finance Parties that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit,
action or proceedings, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with this
Agreement or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
(respectively “Proceedings” and “Disputes”) and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts.

**46.2 Waiver**

Each of the Obligors (other than the US Borrower) irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or
hereafter have to Proceedings being brought or Disputes settled in the courts of England and agrees not to
claim that any such court is an inconvenient or inappropriate forum.

**46.3 Service of Process**

Each of the Obligors (other than the US Borrower) which is not incorporated in England agrees that the
process by which any Proceedings are begun may be served on it by being delivered in connection with
any Proceedings in England, to the Company at its registered office for the time being and the Company,
by its signature to this Agreement, accepts its appointment as such in respect of each such Obligor. If the
appointment of the person mentioned in this Clause 46.3 (Service of Process) ceases to be effective in
respect of any of the Obligors the relevant Obligor shall immediately appoint a further person in England
to accept service of process on its behalf in England and, failing such appointment within 15 days, the
Facility Agent shall be entitled to appoint such person by notice to the relevant Obligor. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

**46.4 Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions**

Nothing in Clause 46.1 (Courts) shall (and shall not be construed so as to) limit the right of the Relevant
Finance Parties or any of them to take Proceedings against any of the Obligors (other than the US
Borrower) in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in any one or
more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or
not) if and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

AA-183


-----

**46.5 US Borrower**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 46 (Jurisdiction), each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States sitting
in the State of New York, and of the courts of the US Borrower’s corporate domicile with respect to
actions or proceedings brought against the US Borrower as a defendant, for purposes of all legal
proceedings relating to the US Borrower (a “US Proceeding”) and relating to, or arising out of, this
Agreement. The US Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any US Proceeding and any claim that any
US Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Any process or summons for purposes of any
US Proceeding may be served on a US Borrower by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail, or a form of
mail substantially equivalent thereto, addressed to it at its address as provided for notices hereunder.

**46.6 General Consent**

Each of the Obligors consents generally in respect of any Proceedings or US Proceedings to the giving of
any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such proceedings including the making,
enforcement or execution against any property whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any
order or judgment which may be made or given in such proceedings.

**46.7 Waiver of Immunity**

To the extent that any Obligor may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its assets or revenues immunity
from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal
process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed to itself, its assets or revenues
such immunity (whether or not claimed), such Obligor irrevocably agrees not to claim, and irrevocably
waives, such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.

**46.8 Waiver of trial by jury**

EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY RELEVANT FINANCE DOCUMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY ANY RELEVANT FINANCE DOCUMENT. THIS
AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO TRIAL BY THE COURT.

**47.** **COMPLETE AGREEMENT**

The Relevant Finance Documents contain the complete agreement between the Parties on the matters to
which they relate and supersede all prior commitments, agreements and understandings, whether written or
oral, on those matters.

This Agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of this Agreement.

To: [Š] as Facility Agent

We refer to the facilities agreement dated [Š] (as from time to time amended, varied, novated or supplemented,
the “Facilities Agreement”) and made between, inter alia, Virgin Media Finance PLC as the Parent, Virgin
Media Investment Holdings Limited, Virgin Media Limited, Virgin Media Wholesale Limited, VMIH Sub
Limited and Virgin Media SFA Finance Limited [and the US Borrower] as Original Borrowers, [Š] as Global
Coordinator [Š] as Bookrunners and Mandated Lead Arrangers, [Š] as Facility Agent, [Š] as Security Trustee and
the financial and other institutions named in it as Lenders. Terms defined in the Facilities Agreement shall have
the same meanings in this Certificate.

I, [name], a [Director/General Partner/Partner/Officer] of [name of Obligor] of [address] (the [“Company”/
”Partnership”])

**CERTIFY without personal liability, that:**

(a) [attached to this Certificate marked “A” are true, correct, complete and up-to-date copies of all
documents which contain or establish or relate to the [constitution of the Company]/[due formation of
the Partnership]*] / [the [Company/Partnership] has not amended any of its constitutional documents in
a manner which could be reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders

and similar principles may limit the ability of a Security Provider to provide a guarantee or
security or may require that the enforcement of the guarantee or security be limited by or to an
amount or otherwise; if any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be
limited to the maximum amount which the relevant Security Provider may provide having regard
to applicable law (including any jurisprudence); additional guarantee limitations may be included
in any Accession Notice where required in connection with the accession of a new Obligor;

(ii) guarantees and security will not be required from or over the shares in, or over the assets of, any
joint venture or similar arrangement or any person which is neither an Obligor nor a Holding
Company of an Obligor;

(iii) third party security providers will not be required to provide any guarantees;

(iv) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the Bank
Group of providing such security (including any increase to the tax and/or regulatory costs of the
Bank Group) so as to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, those costs are
proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Finance Parties and the maximum guaranteed or
secured amount may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other
applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount
is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable
fees, taxes and duties, taking into account the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration
or other applicable fees, taxes and duties, provided that no maximum secured amount may be
limited to minimise any taxes imposed pursuant to section 956 of the Code;

(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will, subject to (iv) above, be granted over the material assets only;

(vi) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by this Agreement and which
prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security document;

(vii) if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or person acquired
by the Bank Group (where those third party arrangements were not entered into in contemplation
of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third party is required for that acquired
person to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset, such guarantee and/or security will
not be required to be granted;

(viii) Security Providers will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that
would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or
result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant
Security Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle;

(ix) the granting of guarantees, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will
be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within the time periods
specified in the Finance Documents thereof or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are

AA-237


-----

specified in the Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order
to ensure due perfection or as otherwise set out in this Schedule;

(x) the granting of guarantees, security or perfection of security will not be required if (1) it would
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Security Provider to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted or not prohibited by the
Finance Documents or (2) it would be either impossible or impractical or would unduly disrupt
the business of the relevant Security Provider and, in each such event, a guarantee will not be
granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets, as applicable (including, without
limitation, notification of such security to any third party);

(xi) the Security Trustee on behalf of each of the Lenders shall be able, subject to the terms of the
Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement, to enforce the security
constituted by the security documents without any restriction from either:

(A) the constitutional documents of the relevant Security Provider;

(B) any Security Provider which is or whose assets are the subject of such security document
(but subject to any inalienable statutory rights which the Security Provider may have to
challenge such enforcement); or

(C) any shareholders of the foregoing not party to the relevant security document;

(xii) guarantee limitations may mean that access to the assets of a Security Provider for its guarantee is
limited, in which case, any asset security granted by that Security Provider shall be proportionate
(in terms of liability) to the value of its guarantee;

(xiii) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Obligors or material assets are not
located;

(xiv) local law restrictions may mean that the Lenders may not be able to benefit from the same
security;

(xv) the Security Trustee will hold one set of security for the Lenders (subject to applicable law);

(xvi) under the Dutch Works Council Act any Dutch members of the Bank Group may not, without the
advice of their works council, inter alia resolve to enter into any transaction effectuating:

(A) the attraction of an important credit on behalf of the relevant Dutch members of the Bank
Group;

(B) the provision of an important credit by such Dutch members of the Bank Group;

(C) the granting of guarantees and security by the relevant Dutch members of the Bank Group
for important debts of another entrepreneur; and

(D) the establishment of a right of pledge over the shares of the relevant Dutch members of the
Bank Group and the conditional transfer of the voting rights to the pledgee; and

(xvii) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any Excluded Swap Obligations.

(c) The Security Trustee (upon request or instruction, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement) or
the other Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall promptly discharge any guarantees and release any
security which is or are subject to any transaction permitted by this Agreement, unless contrary to these
Security Principles.

2. **Guarantors and Security**

(a) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 28 (Guarantees and Indemnity) of this Agreement and the
Security Principles, each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and
will be for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject
to, the requirements of the Security Principles set out in paragraph 1 above in each relevant jurisdiction
and the requirements of local law in each relevant jurisdiction.

(b) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 28 (Guarantees and Indemnity) of this Agreement and this
Schedule, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Trustee and not the Finance Parties
individually. “Parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be contained
in the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual

AA-238


-----

security documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be no action
required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender transfers any of its
participation in the Facilities to a new Lender.

(c) Security Documents will, to the extent legally possible and subject to this Schedule, incorporate the
defined terms used in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and/or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement and
secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Group Intercreditor Agreement and/or the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement) of the relevant Obligor to the secured parties, in each case in accordance with,
and subject to, local law requirements and the requirements of this Schedule in each relevant
jurisdiction and, in no circumstances, shall impose any obligation more onerous than those contained in
this Agreement other than to the extent required by local law in order to create, enforce or perfect the
security interest expressed to be created thereby.

(d) Where a Security Provider secures shares, the relevant security document will be governed by the laws
of the company whose shares are being charged or pledged and not by the law of the country of the
Security Provider.

(e) No action will be required to be taken in relation to any guarantee or security where any Lender
transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Facilities. The Security Providers will not be liable for
any fees, costs, taxes or expenses in relation to any re-registration, re-notarisation or other requirement
for perfection or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by Finance Parties.

(f) Any security document shall only be required to be notarised or notarially certified if required by law
in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence.

3. **Terms of Security Documents**

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken as part of this transaction
subject to due execution of all relevant security documents, completion of all relevant formalities, the
reservations or qualifications in the Finance Documents or any legal opinion referred to in Clause 21.4(a)

in (i) and (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, security in respect of any real property);

(b) the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any security permitted under the
Finance Documents;

(c) security will not be enforceable until the date on which, following the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing, either the Relevant Agent (as defined in the Group Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Trustee notifies the relevant chargor of the occurrence of that Event of
Default, or takes, under any one or more of the Senior Finance Documents (as defined in the Group
Intercreditor Agreement), any of the steps it is entitled to take by reason of the occurrence of such
Event of Default and will be enforceable only subject to the terms of the Group Intercreditor
Agreement and the HYD Intercreditor Agreement (a “Declared Default”);

(d) any rights of set-off will not be exercisable until the occurrence of a Declared Default;

(e) notification of receivables security to debtors (other than intra-group debtors where notice will be given
as soon as is reasonably practicable) will only be given if a Declared Default has occurred (subject to
local law advice);

AA-239


-----

(f) subject to paragraph (g) below, representations and undertakings shall only be included in each security
document to the extent they relate to the security interest or secured assets or any registration or
perfection of the security unless otherwise required by local law;

(g) the provisions of each security document will not be unduly burdensome on the Security Provider (in
relation to the benefit conferred) or interfere materially with the operation of its business and will be
limited to those required to create effective security and will not impose commercial obligations and
shall not contain additional representations and undertakings (such as in respect of insurance,
maintenance of assets, information or the payment of costs) or otherwise repeat any such
representations or undertakings given in this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the
HYD Intercreditor Agreement, other than those which are strictly required as a matter of law for the
creation and perfection of the security;

(h) in the security documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in this Agreement
(or the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement) including, without
limitation, those relating to notices, costs and expenses, default or penalty interest, indemnities, tax
gross up or indemnity, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and
undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent that they are strictly
required by local law for the creation and perfection of the security interest expressed to be created
thereby; the security documents will not contain repeating representations;

(i) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, that they are strictly
required by local law to be provided to perfect, enforce or register the security and, when required,
shall be provided no more frequently than annually or, following a Declared Default on the Security
Trustee’s written request;

(j) the security documents should not and will not operate so as to prevent transactions which are not
prohibited under the other Finance Documents;

(k) the secured parties shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of a
Declared Default or if the relevant Security Provider has failed to comply with a further assurance or
perfection obligation within 10 Business Days of being notified of that failure and being requested to
comply (provided that in such case, the power of attorney shall be limited to remedying such failure);

(l) the Security Trustee shall (and is irrevocably authorised and instructed to) promptly enter into and
deliver any documentation and/or take such other action as may be required by the Company to give
effect to the Security Principles;

(m) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same
type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental charges to be delivered in respect
of future assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental
charges shall be provided at intervals no more frequently than annually, in each case on the Security
Trustee’s reasonable written request; and

(n) each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the
security document and this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor
Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of this Agreement or (as
applicable) the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor Agreement will take priority
over the provisions of the relevant security document.

4. **Share Security**

(a) Subject to these Security Principles the shares in each Obligor shall be secured.

(b) The security document will be governed by the laws of the Obligor whose shares are being secured and
not by the law of the country of the Security Provider granting the security.

(c) Until a Declared Default, the Security Provider will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights
to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of the security or cause an event of default to occur and the Security Providers will be
permitted to pay dividends to each of its shareholders.

(d) Where customary the share certificate and a stock transfer form executed in blank will be provided to
the Security Trustee, and where required by law the share certificate or shareholders register will be
endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided
to the Security Trustee, in each case, within 20 Business Days following execution of any security over
those shares or the registration of the acquisition of those shares that are subject to such security.

AA-240


-----

(e) Unless the restriction is required by law (or as expressly contemplated in any security document), the
constitutional documents of any company the shares in which are subject to security will be amended
to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement
of the security granted over them.

(f) The enforcement of security over shares and the acquisition or exercise by the Security Trustee of
voting rights in respect of shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, enforcement of
any security over shares and the exercise by the Security Trustee of the voting rights in respect of such
shares will be expressed to be conditional upon obtaining any consents required by law or regulation
and no such consents shall be required to be sought or requested prior to a Declared Default and written
request having been made by the Security Trustee to the Company.

5. **Receivables**

(a) If a Security Provider grants security over its intercompany receivables or rights in respect of
Subordinated Funding it shall be free to deal with same in the course of its business (provided
permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement) until notified by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default.

(b) The perfection of receivables security granted by notification will not be required until the occurrence
of a Declared Default other than where such notification is required by applicable law to create
security. If such notification is required by applicable law to perfect, notice of the security will be
served on the relevant counterparties in respect of material intercompany receivables and Subordinated
Funding within 20 Business Days of the security being granted and the Security Provider shall use its
commercially reasonable endeavours (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of external
expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the
Security Provider has used its commercially reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain
acknowledgement or acceptance its obligation to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance shall cease on
the expiry of that 20 Business Day period.

(c) Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would
prevent the Security Provider from dealing with a receivable in the course of its business (provided
permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement) no notice of security shall be served until required by the Facility Agent
following a Declared Default.

6. **Release of Security**

Unless required by local law, the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt
with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be
the same as those set out in this Agreement, the Group Intercreditor Agreement or the HYD Intercreditor
Agreement.

So long as any Notes remain outstanding under the Indenture, each of the Company and the New VM Credit

Group is required to prepay, or to procure that there is prepaid any amount of the Additional Facilities
in relation to Term Facilities with Disposal Proceeds pursuant to Clause 12.2 (Mandatory prepayment
_from disposal proceeds) of the VM Credit Facility, the Company and the New VM Credit Facility_
Borrower will elect, with respect to the applicable New Finco Loans, in their sole discretion, to either:

(A) by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, offer to prepay a principal amount of (x) the Finco
Loan $ equal to the lesser of (I) the Available Disposal Proceeds on a pro rata basis with the
other New Finco Loans and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes tendered
in the Asset Sale Offer to be made by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture in respect of such
Available Disposal Proceeds, and (y) the Finco Loan £ equal to the lesser of (I) the Available
Disposal Proceeds on a pro rata basis with the other New Finco Loans and (II) the aggregate
principal amount of the Sterling Notes tendered in the Asset Sale Offer to be made by the
Issuer pursuant to the Indenture in respect of such Available Disposal Proceeds, which notice
will further state that the Company and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower are required to
make a prepayment of the applicable New Finco Loan pursuant to Clause 12.2 (Mandatory
_prepayment from disposal proceeds) of the VM Credit Facility, will include the amount of_
Available Disposal Proceeds to be applied to prepay the applicable New Finco Loans and
will be given not less than 25 Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment;

(B) on or prior to the settlement date for the Asset Sale Offer made by the Issuer in respect of
such Available Disposal Proceeds, the Company and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower
will prepay (or procure the prepayment of) a principal amount of the applicable New Finco
Loans as required under Clause 2.1(a)(i)(A) above; and

(C) for purposes of Clause 12.4(d) of the VM Credit Facility, the Issuer shall be deemed to have
waived its right to be prepaid any amount of New Finco Loans in excess of the principal
amount prepaid as described in Clause 2.1(a)(i)(B); or

(ii) on not less than 10 Business Days’ notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, prepay (or procure the
prepayment of) the New Finco Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to the Available
Disposal Proceeds plus a payment in an amount equal to the payment (set forth in Clauses 23, 24
or 25, as applicable, of the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements) that would be payable by
the Company to the VM Credit Facility Agent (for the account of the Issuer), if any, if such
prepayment were made on such date pursuant to Clause 11.1 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the VM
Credit Facility.

(b) Neither the Company nor the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will prepay, or procure that there is
prepaid, any amount of the New Finco Loans pursuant to Clause 12.2 (Mandatory prepayment from
_disposal proceeds) of the VM Credit Facility except as set forth in Clause 2.1(a) above._

None of the Company or the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will, and the Company will procure that no
other member of the Bank Group will, make any offer to purchase or otherwise acquire any VM Credit
Facility Loans (whether through a tender offer process or other process) at a price below the relevant
prevailing market price for such VM Credit Facility Loans and including all or a portion of the New Finco

AB-5


-----

Loans held by the Issuer, unless the Issuer or any other member of the Bank Group makes a
contemporaneous offer to purchase some or all of the applicable Notes on substantially similar terms as the
offer to purchase the applicable New Finco Loans; provided that (1) in no event will holders of such Notes
be required to participate in any such offer, (2) the consideration offered to holders of the relevant series of
Notes will not be less than the consideration they would have received as VM Credit Facility Lenders in
connection with such offer to purchase the applicable VM Credit Facility Loans and (3) the Company and/or
the Issuer shall have confirmed to the Trustee that such purchases will not result in taxable income for the
Issuer, including upon the extinguishment of Financial Indebtedness in connection therewith, or that the
Company will have agreed to pay (directly or indirectly) any such income tax payable.

**2.3 Minimum Period for Consents under VM Credit Facility Loan Documents**

In the event that the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender under the New Finco Loans, is eligible or
required to vote (or otherwise consent) with respect to any request by any member of the Bank Group for
any waiver, amendment or supplement to any VM Credit Facility Loan Document or any other
determination to be made by the VM Credit Facility Lenders (other than with respect to the VM Credit
Facility Amendments) each of the Company and the New VM Credit Facility Borrower agrees, and the
Company agrees to procure that each other member of the Bank Group agrees, that the period during which
the Issuer, as a VM Credit Facility Lender, will be eligible to validly vote (or otherwise consent) with
respect to any such waiver, amendment, supplement or determination will not be less than 10 Business Days
from the date when written request for such waiver, amendment or supplement is first made to the VM
Credit Facility Lenders. The Company will distribute, or cause to be distributed, to holders of the relevant
series of Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note, or otherwise make available
(including through the facilities of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or via an Internet web site or an
electronic information provider, as applicable) all documents related to any such waiver, amendment,
supplement or other determination distributed to the Issuer as a VM Credit Facility Lender, including all
documentation necessary to enable the holders of the relevant series of Notes to vote in the manner set forth
in Article 9 (Amendment, Supplement and Waiver) of the Indenture, within three Business Days after the
date when written request for such waiver, amendment or supplement is first made to the VM Credit Facility
Lenders.

**2.4 Payment for Consents**

None of the Company or the New VM Credit Facility Borrower will, and the Company will procure that no
other member of the Bank Group will, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or
for the benefit of any VM Credit Facility Lender for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment under any VM Credit Facility Loan Document which is subject to the consent of the Instructing
Group or all VM Credit Facility Lenders, other than in respect of the VM Credit Facility Amendments,
unless (i) such consideration is also offered to be paid to the Issuer (as a VM Credit Facility Lender) in

pursuant to the terms of or in respect of the VM Credit Facility to “public” VM Credit Facility Lenders via

absolute discretion other than the Claim and any obligations ranking pari passu with or behind the
Claim. If there are no Net Proceeds, any outstanding debt shall be extinguished and the Issuer shall
have no obligations to the Company or the New VM Credit Facility Borrower (as the case may be)
under this Deed.

Issuer’s obligations under this Deed are solely its corporate obligations, and that each of the Company

(ii) do not seek to regulate a particular matter, step or action (which shall be the case if the
relevant matter, step or action is not the subject of an express requirement or restriction in that
Debt Document),

for the purposes of this Agreement, that matter, step or action shall not be prohibited by the terms of
that Debt Document.

(u) In determining whether any indebtedness or other amount (including, without limitation, any Second

amount is incurred by a member of the Group or following the taking effect of such
amendment or waiver,

shall not be taken into account (including for purposes of any vote or consent of any class (including
an Instructing Group) for the purposes of any Debt Document in respect of any such amendment or
waiver).

subject to the consent of specified Parties under this Agreement), the Parties hereto agree that such
step or action will be permitted under the other Debt Documents (or permitted thereunder subject to
the consent of such specified Parties) and if there is any conflict between the terms of, or the
requirement for any conditions in, this Agreement and any other Debt Document, the terms of, or the
requirement for any conditions in, this Agreement will prevail (save to the extent that to do so would
result in or have the effect of any member of the Group contravening any applicable law or
regulation, or present a material risk of liability for any member of the Group and/or its directors or
officers, or give rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties), in each case
notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the contrary, any provision expressed or purported
to override any provision of this Agreement or the requirement to fulfil any additional conditions, in
each case, in any other Debt Document.

(x) References to any Creditors (or any class, group or percentage of any Creditors (including, for the

to this Agreement implemented from time to time, and such paragraph and clause numbers are
referred to in any other Debt Document in force at the time of such amendments, such paragraph or
clause numbers shall be read and construed in this Agreement, for the purposes of the relevant Debt
Document only, so that the relevant equivalent provision in this Agreement is referred to in each
such Debt Document.

currency of the Documentary Credit to an interest-bearing account in the name of that Party and the
following conditions being met:

the account may only be made to pay the relevant Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to it
under the Debt Documents in respect of that Documentary Credit; and

(iii) if requested by the relevant Issuing Bank, the provider of the cash cover has executed a
security document over that account, in form and substance satisfactory to such Issuing Bank

taken or not taken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement while that Insolvency Event is
continuing).

(dd) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, where any provision of this Agreement grants any rights
(“Rights”) to, or refers to or otherwise contemplates any consent, approval, release, waiver,

any person:

(i) which is not a Party at such time;

relation thereto) at such time; or

has occurred at or prior to such time or concurrently with any Action coming into effect,

unless otherwise agreed or specified by the Company, no Rights shall accrue or be enforceable and
such Action shall not be required (or be required from any person that is a party thereto) and no such
provision shall, or shall be construed so as to, in any way prohibit or restrict the rights or actions of
any member of the Group. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, no references to any agreement which
is not in existence (or under which no debt obligations are outstanding) shall, or shall be construed
so as to, in any way prohibit or restrict the rights or actions of any member of the Group (and no
Rights shall be granted to, or Action shall be required from, any party thereto).

(ee) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the express terms of this Agreement and any other applicable
Debt Document, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any debt exchange, non-cash rollover or
other similar or equivalent transaction in relation to any Liabilities.

(ff) To the extent that in this Agreement the consent of any Agent under any Debt Document or the
relevant Creditors under any Debt Document is required, then such consent is hereby expressly given

Group, the Majority High Yield Creditors, the Majority High Yield Lenders, the Majority Second
Lien Creditors, the Majority Second Lien Lenders, the Majority Senior Creditors, the Majority
Senior Lenders, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or any other class, group or percentage of any

(a) Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, a person who is not a Party has no right
under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the “Third Parties Rights Act”) to enforce
or to enjoy the benefit of any term of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, the Consent of any person who is not a Party is not

Noteholder, Second Lien Noteholder, High Yield Noteholder or Unsecured Noteholder which by

to receive the benefits hereof, and be subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as if such person
was a Party hereto. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, upon any person becoming a Senior
Secured Noteholder, Second Lien Noteholder, High Yield Noteholder or Unsecured Noteholder,
such person shall be deemed a Party provided that such person is deemed to be a Party under the
terms of the relevant Notes Indenture.

or any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any Liabilities owed to it by
a Debtor or Security Grantor with the prior consent of the Company; and by written notice from the
Company to each Agent party to this Agreement and the Security Agent at such time (a “Unilateral
**Waiver”).**

(b) Following a Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the Security
Agent shall (i) be deemed to have unilaterally waived, relinquished, or otherwise released or
declined the right to receive or benefit from the same or any substantially equivalent right to the
rights subject to such Unilateral Waiver, in connection with any parallel debt and/or joint and several
creditorship structure relating to the relevant Liabilities; and (ii) at the request and cost of the
Company, take any action or execute any document reasonably requested by the Company which is
necessary or desirable to give effect to or evidence the releases and other actions described in this
Clause 1.4.

(c) Any Unilateral Waiver by a Party in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall also be deemed to
constitute a waiver of the rights of such Party (and the Security Agent, as relevant) under Clause 18
(Application of Proceeds), Clause 19 (Equalisation) and any other equalisation or loss sharing
provisions under any Debt Document in so far as such provisions relate to the rights subject to such
Unilateral Waiver, including such that to the extent that the Liabilities of a Creditor would, but for
the Unilateral Waiver, have had the benefit of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss or Transaction Security under which Group Recoveries are received by the Security Agent or
other Creditors, that Creditor will not benefit from the application of, or receive any payments in
respect of, such Group Recoveries pursuant to Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) in respect of
those Liabilities; and if, as a result of this paragraph (c), the amount of a payment to a Creditor
pursuant to Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) is lower than the amount which would have been so

“Shortfall”), for the purposes of Clause 19 (Equalisation) its Exposure will be deemed to be reduced
by an amount equal to the Shortfall.

(d) To the extent that the consent of any Creditor or other Party (in each case other than the Company
and each Party granting such Unilateral Waiver) would be required to give effect to any Unilateral
Waiver or any other action or matter set out in this Clause 1.4, such Creditor or other Party shall be
deemed to have given such consent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Debt Document:

(i) no breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, obligation or other term of (or Default
or Event of Default under) a Debt Document shall be deemed or construed to have occurred as
a direct or indirect result of a Unilateral Waiver or any actions or steps implemented or taken
to give effect to that Unilateral Waiver; and

(ii) for the purpose of testing or satisfying any requirement (or any qualifier or definition based
upon such a requirement) in any Debt Document that any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss or any Transaction Security must, to the extent legally possible or
subject to the Agreed Security Principles (or both), be given, or expressed to be given, to all
Secured Parties in respect of their Liabilities, any Liabilities the subject of a Unilateral Waiver
shall be deemed to have been given or expressed to have been given that guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss or any Transaction Security.

**1.5** **No Recourse**

No Primary Creditor will have any recourse to or shall make any claim or demand for payment from the
Ultimate Parent (as defined in the Original Senior Facilities Agreement) or any other person that is not
party to a Debt Document (and to the extent the Ultimate Parent or any other person is a party to a Debt
Document there shall only be recourse to the extent of its liability under the terms of such Debt Document)
in respect of any term of any Debt Document, any statements by the Ultimate Parent, or otherwise.

**1.6** **Personal Liability**

Where any natural person gives a certificate or other document or otherwise gives a representation or
statement on behalf of any of the parties to the Debt Documents pursuant to any provision thereof and such
certificate or other document, representation or statement proves to be incorrect, the individual shall incur
no personal liability in consequence of such certificate, other document, representation or statement being
incorrect save where such individual acted fraudulently in giving such certificate, other document,
representation or statement (in which case any liability of such individual shall be determined in
accordance with applicable law) and each such individual may rely on this Clause subject to Clause 1.3

the extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those Liabilities, but without
prejudice to Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) and Clause 19 (Equalisation)), pari passu
and without any preference between them; and

(ii) **second, the Second Lien Liabilities (other than the Second Lien Agent Liabilities) pari passu**
and without any preference between them.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that any Hedging Liability that
constitutes an Excluded Swap Obligation shall not be secured by the assets of any Non-ECP Debtor.

**2.3** **Intra-Group Liabilities and Subordinated Liabilities**

(a) Each of the Parties agrees that the Intra-Group Liabilities and Subordinated Liabilities are postponed
and subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors or the Security Grantors to the Primary
Creditors.

(b) This Agreement does not purport to rank any of the Intra-Group Liabilities and Subordinated
Liabilities as between themselves.

**2.4** **Additional and/or Refinancing Debt**

(a) The Creditors acknowledge that the Debtors (or any of them) may wish to (a) incur incremental
Borrowing Liabilities and/or Guarantee Liabilities in respect of incremental Borrowing Liabilities or
(b) refinance Borrowing Liabilities and/or incur Guarantee Liabilities in respect of any such
refinancing of Borrowing Liabilities, which in any such case are intended to rank and/or share any
existing Security pari passu with any existing Liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing
Liabilities and/or to share in any existing Security behind any existing Liabilities. The Creditors
confirm that if and to the extent such a financing or refinancing and such ranking and such Security
is permitted by the terms of the Debt Documents at such time, they will (at the cost of the Debtors)
co-operate with the Debtors with a view to enabling such financing or refinancing and such sharing
in the Security to take place. In particular, but without limitation, the Senior Lenders, the Senior
Secured Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Lenders, the Second Lien
Noteholders, the High Yield Lenders, the High Yield Noteholders, the Unsecured Lenders and the
Unsecured Noteholders hereby authorise and direct their Agent to and such Agent shall, and the
Hedge Counterparties agree that they shall, execute any amendment to this Agreement and such
other Debt Documents that are reasonably required to reflect such arrangements to the extent such
financing, refinancing and/or sharing is permitted by such Debt Documents.

(b) The Debtors may not incur any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities which:

(i) fall within paragraph (c) of the definition of Secured Obligations; but

(ii) do not fall within paragraphs (a) or (b) of the definition of Secured Obligations,

unless additional Security is granted in favour of the Secured Parties over the assets secured by each
Pre-Effective Date Security Document.

**2.5** **Anti-layering**

(a) Until the Second Lien Discharge Date, no Debtor shall, without the approval of the Majority Second
Lien Creditors, issue or allow to remain outstanding any Liabilities that:

(i) are secured or expressed to be secured by Transaction Security on a basis junior to the Senior
Secured Liabilities but senior to the Second Lien Liabilities;

(ii) are expressed to rank or rank so that they are subordinated to any of the Senior Secured
Liabilities but are senior to the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(iii) are contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Liabilities and senior
in right of payment to the Second Lien Liabilities.

(b) The foregoing shall not prevent:

(i) subordination arising by operation of law; or

(ii) a Debtor from incurring additional Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Finance Documents which are expressed to be secured by the Transaction Security on a
_pari passu super senior basis to the other Senior Liabilities and/or which are contractually_
senior in right of payment to any of the other Senior Liabilities.

Lender Liabilities, Pari Passu Debt Liabilities or Senior Secured Notes Liabilities except from Group
Recoveries distributed in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

accordance with the Secured Debt Documents;

(ii) such amendment or waiver would not result in a breach of the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture(s) or the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

**4.7** **Security: Hedge Counterparties**

Master Agreement).

(a) To the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, a Hedge Counterparty may
terminate or close-out in whole or in part any hedging transaction under that Hedging Agreement

relation to a Debtor that is a party to that Hedging Agreement;

(v) if the obligations owing by any Debtor under the relevant Hedging Agreement cease to be

prior to their discharge); or

Agreement following the occurrence of all such discharge dates.

(b) If a Debtor has defaulted on any Payment due under a Hedging Agreement (after allowing any
applicable notice or grace periods) and the default has continued unwaived for more than five
Business Days after notice of that default has been given by the relevant Hedge Counterparty to the
relevant Debtor and to the Security Agent pursuant to paragraph (m) of Clause 26.3 (Notification of
_prescribed events), the relevant Hedge Counterparty:_

(i) may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, terminate or
close-out in whole or in part all hedging transactions under that Hedging Agreement; and

(ii) until such time as the Security Agent has given notice to that Hedge Counterparty that the

**4.10 Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties**

close-out in full all hedging transactions under all of the Hedging Agreements to which it is party
prior to their stated maturity, following:

Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event and delivery to it of a notice from the Security
Agent that that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt Acceleration Event or Senior
Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable) has occurred; and

(ii) delivery to it of a subsequent notice from the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an
Instructing Group) instructing it to do so.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to the extent that that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt
Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable) occurred as a result

AC-59

of an arrangement made between any Debtor and any Senior Secured Creditor with the purpose of
bringing about that Senior Acceleration Event, Pari Passu Debt Acceleration Event or Senior
Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable).

(c) If a Hedge Counterparty is entitled to terminate or close-out any hedging transaction under
paragraph (b) of Clause 4.9 (Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties) (or would have been
able to if that Hedge Counterparty had given the notice referred to in that paragraph) but has not
terminated or closed out each such hedging transaction, that Hedge Counterparty shall promptly
terminate or close-out in full each such hedging transaction following a request to do so by the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group).

**4.11 Treatment of Payments due to Debtors on termination of hedging transactions**

(a) If, on termination of any hedging transaction under any Hedging Agreement occurring after a
Distress Event, a settlement amount or other amount (following the application of any Close-Out
Netting, Payment Netting or Inter-Hedging Agreement Netting in respect of that Hedging
Agreement) falls due from a Hedge Counterparty to the relevant Debtor then that amount shall be
paid by that Hedge Counterparty to the Security Agent, treated as the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) The payment of that amount by the Hedge Counterparty to the Security Agent in accordance with
paragraph (a) above shall discharge the Hedge Counterparty’s obligation to pay that amount to that
Debtor.

**4.12 Terms of Hedging Agreements**

In the case of each Hedging Agreement entered into after the Effective Date, the Hedge Counterparties (to
the extent party to the Hedging Agreement in question) and the Debtors party to the Hedging Agreements
shall ensure that, at all times:

(a) each Hedging Agreement documents only Offsetting Swaps and/or other hedging transactions
permitted by the terms of the Senior Finance Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Senior
Secured Notes Finance Documents and the Second Lien Finance Documents, provided that this
paragraph (a) applies only to Debtors;

(b) each Hedging Agreement is based on or incorporates by reference either (i) an ISDA Master
Agreement or (ii) another framework agreement which is similar in effect to an ISDA Master
Agreement;

(c) in the event of a termination of the hedging transaction entered into under a Hedging Agreement,
whether as a result of:

(i) a Termination Event or an Event of Default, each as defined in the relevant Hedging
Agreement (in the case of a Hedging Agreement which is based on an ISDA Master
Agreement); or

(ii) an event similar in meaning and effect to either of those described in paragraph (i) above (in
the case of a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement),

that Hedging Agreement will:

(A) if it is based on a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, provide for payments under the
“Second Method” and will make no material amendment to section 6(e) (Payments on
_Early Termination) of the ISDA Master Agreement;_

(B) if it is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, make no material amendment to the
provisions of section 6(e) (Payments on Early Termination) of the ISDA Master
Agreement; or

(C) if it is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement, provide for any other method the effect
of which is that the party to which that event is referable will be entitled to receive
payment under the relevant termination provisions if the net replacement value of all
terminated transactions entered into under that Hedging Agreement is in its favour;

(d) each Hedging Agreement will provide that the relevant Hedge Counterparty will be entitled to
designate an Early Termination Date (as defined in the relevant ISDA Master Agreement) or
otherwise be able to terminate each transaction under such Hedging Agreement if so required
pursuant to Clause 4.10 (Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties);

AC-60


-----

(e) each Hedging Agreement will permit (but shall not require) the relevant Debtor to exercise its rights
provided for in (and in accordance with) Clause 4.13 (Termination of Hedging); and

(f) each Hedging Agreement states that it is a Hedging Agreement for the purposes of this Agreement.

**4.13 Termination of Hedging**

Each Debtor shall have the right (but not the obligation) to:

(a) terminate and cancel any Hedging Agreement upon 5 Business Days prior written notice to the
relevant Hedge Counterparty (with a copy to the Security Agent), provided that there are no
outstanding hedging transactions thereunder;

(b) terminate (in full or in part) any transaction under a Hedging Agreement with the prior written
consent of the relevant Hedge Counterparty, provided that no Senior Default, Senior Secured Notes
Default or Pari Passu Debt Default has occurred and is continuing at such time; and/or

(c) notwithstanding (b) above, terminate in full (or in part) any transaction under a Hedging Agreement
if at any time the financial indebtedness underlying such transaction has been reduced and the
Debtor party to that Hedging Agreement gives notice to the relevant Hedge Counterparty specifying
that there has been a reduction of financial indebtedness and the Debtor has elected to terminate the
transactions entered into to hedge risks in relation to such financial indebtedness (each such
transaction, a “Relevant Transaction”). Only a portion of each outstanding Relevant Transaction
shall be treated as an Affected Transaction under and as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement,
such portion being a percentage of the Relevant Transaction equal to or less than (if so determined
by the relevant Debtor) the percentage by which the relevant financial indebtedness has been
reduced.

**4.14 No Outstanding Transactions**

If a Hedging Agreement is terminated by the relevant Debtor in circumstances where there are no
outstanding transactions thereunder, as provided for in paragraph (a) of Clause 4.13 (Termination of
_Hedging), the Hedge Counterparty to that Hedging Agreement shall immediately cease to be a Hedge_
Counterparty in respect of that Hedging Agreement for the purposes of this Agreement and shall be
discharged from further obligations to the Parties under this Agreement in respect of that Hedging
Agreement and their respective rights against one another in respect of that Hedging Agreement shall be
cancelled (except in each case for those rights which arose prior to such termination).

**4.15 Offsetting Swaps**

A Debtor may enter into a secured hedging transaction (an “Offsetting Swap”) with a Hedge Counterparty
that has the economic effect of fully offsetting the mark to market movements of all or part of an existing
hedging transaction under a Hedging Agreement (each an “Existing Unmatured Hedge”).

**4.16 Terminations of Offsetting Swaps**

The relevant Debtor shall, and the Company shall procure that the relevant Debtor shall, promptly
terminate a proportion of any Offsetting Swap upon the termination or close-out of the corresponding
Existing Unmatured Hedge, such proportion to be equal to the proportion of such Existing Unmatured
Hedge that has been terminated.

**5.** **GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY TO HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES**

**5.1** **Guarantee and Indemnity**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss in favour of any Hedge Counterparty under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) shall only apply and take effect on and from such time as a_
Debtor provides a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss to another Senior Secured
Creditor (other than a Hedge Counterparty) under or pursuant to a Secured Debt Document.

AC-61


-----

(b) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

(i) guarantees to each Hedge Counterparty punctual performance by each other Debtor of all that
Debtor’s payment obligations under the Hedging Agreements;

(ii) undertakes with each Hedge Counterparty that whenever another Debtor does not pay any
amount when due under or in connection with any Hedging Agreement, that Debtor shall
immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

(iii) agrees with each Hedge Counterparty that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes
unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify
that Hedge Counterparty immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as
a result of a Debtor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability,
invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Hedging Agreement on the date
when it would have been due. The amount payable by a Debtor under this indemnity will not
exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to
_Hedge Counterparties) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a_
guarantee.

**5.2** **Continuing guarantee**

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any
Debtor under the Hedging Agreements, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in
part.

**5.3** **Reinstatement**

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Debtor or any
security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Hedge Counterparty in whole or in part on the
basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency,
liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Debtor under this
Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) will continue or be reinstated as if the
discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

**5.4** **Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Debtor under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)
will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 5 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties), would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this_
Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) (without limitation and whether or not
known to it or any Hedge Counterparty) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Debtor or other person;

(b) the release of any other Debtor or any other person under the terms of any composition or
arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect,
take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Debtor or other person or any
non-presentation or non- observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any
instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the
members or status of a Debtor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however fundamental and whether or
not more onerous) or replacement of a Hedging Agreement or any other document or security
including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any
amount due or the addition of any new Hedging Liability under any Hedging Agreement or other
document or security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Hedging
Agreement or any other document or security; or

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

AC-62


-----

**5.5** **Debtor Intent**

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 5.4 (Waiver of defences), each Debtor expressly confirms
that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation,
increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Hedging Agreements or amount made available under
any of the Hedging Agreements.

**5.6** **Immediate Recourse**

Each Debtor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or
agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any
person before claiming from that Debtor under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge
_Counterparties). This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Hedging Agreement to_
the contrary.

**5.7** **Appropriations**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Debtors under or in connection with the
Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full, each Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or agent
on its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that
Hedge Counterparty (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and
enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or
otherwise) and no Debtor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Debtor or on account of
any Debtor’s liability under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties).

**5.8** **Deferral of Debtors’ Rights**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Debtors under or in connection with the
Hedging Agreements have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Security Agent otherwise directs, no
Debtor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under
the Hedging Agreements or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 5
(Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties):

(a) to be indemnified by a Debtor;

(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Debtor’s obligations under the Hedging
Agreements;

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights
of the Hedge Counterparties under the Hedging Agreements or of any other guarantee or security
taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Hedging Agreements by any Hedge Counterparty;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Debtor to make any payment, or
perform any obligation, in respect of which any Debtor has given a guarantee, undertaking or
indemnity under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties);

(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Debtor; and/or

(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Debtor in competition with any Hedge Counterparty.

If a Debtor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall promptly pay or
transfer the same to the Security Agent or as the Security Agent may direct for application in accordance
with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

**5.9** **Release of Debtors’ Rights of Contribution**

If any Debtor (a “Retiring Debtor”) ceases to be a Debtor in accordance with the terms of any Secured
Debt Document for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Debtor then on the date such
Retiring Debtor ceases to be a Debtor:

(a) that Retiring Debtor is released by each other Debtor from any liability (whether past, present or
future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Debtor arising by reason
of the performance by any other Debtor of its obligations under the Hedging Agreements; and

AC-63


-----

(b) each other Debtor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations
under the Hedging Agreements to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of
subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Hedge Counterparties under any Hedging Agreement
or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Hedging Agreement where
such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Debtor.

**5.10 Additional security**

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or
subsequently held by any Hedge Counterparty.

**5.11 Limitation of Liabilities of United States Guarantors**

Each Restricted Debtor and each of the Hedge Counterparties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the
guarantee under this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)) hereby confirms its
intention that this guarantee should not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for the purposes of
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the United States Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any
similar Federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Restricted Debtor and each
of the Hedge Counterparties (by its acceptance of the benefits of the guarantee under this Clause 5
(Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties)) hereby irrevocably agrees that its obligations under
this Clause 5 (Guarantee and Indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) shall be limited to the maximum amount
as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of
such Restricted Debtor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any rights to
contribution pursuant to any agreement providing for an equitable contribution among such Restricted
Debtor and the other Guarantors, result in the obligations of such Restricted Debtor in respect of such
maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(d) Each Restricted Debtor formed in the state of California waives, to the extent permitted by law, for
the benefit of the Hedge Counterparties:

(i) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a
surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal;

(ii) in accordance with Section 2855 of the California Civil Code, any and all rights and defenses
available to it by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code;

(iii) any defense based upon any Hedge Counterparty’s errors or omissions in the administration of
the Hedging Agreements, except behaviour that amounts to bad faith;

(iv) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, that are or might be in conflict with
the terms of this guarantee and any legal or equitable discharge of such Restricted Debtor’s
obligations hereunder;

(v) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Restricted Debtor’s liability hereunder
or the enforcement hereof;

(vi) any rights to set offs, recoupments and counterclaims;

(vii) other than as expressly set forth in Clause 5.1 (Guarantee and Indemnity), promptness,
diligence, notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonour,
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this guarantee, notices of default
under this Agreement, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the guarantied
obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any
Borrower, notices of any of the matters referred to in Clause 5.6 (Immediate Recourse) and
any right to consent to any thereof; and

(viii) any right to revoke such Restricted Debtor’s obligations hereunder as to future obligations.

(e) Notwithstanding any term or provision of this Agreement, with respect to any US Borrower, no
direct or indirect CFC Subsidiary of such US Borrower, FSHCO or Subsidiary of either of the
foregoing shall be required to make any payment on behalf of any US Borrower; guarantee or
support the obligations of, or pledge any of its assets as security for the obligations of, any US
Borrower; and no more than 65 per cent. of the total combined voting power of all classes of all
voting stock or voting shares, or any other voting equity interest in any direct CFC Subsidiary or

AC-64


-----

FSHCO, shall be pledged as security for the obligations of any US Borrower. For these purposes,
“US Borrower” has the meaning given to such term in the Senior Facilities Agreement and any
Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as applicable), “CFC Subsidiary” means each Subsidiary of a
US Borrower that is incorporated or organised under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States or any state or territory thereof and is a “controlled foreign corporation” (within the
meaning of Section 957 of the Code) and “FSHCO” means any entity, substantially all the assets of
which consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more CFC
Subsidiaries or entities that are themselves FSHCOs.

**5.12 US Guarantors**

(a) Terms used in this clause are to be construed in accordance with the Fraudulent Transfer Laws.

(b) Each Restricted Debtor acknowledges that:

(i) it will receive valuable direct or indirect benefits as a result of the transactions financed by the
Hedging Agreements;

(ii) those benefits will constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the
purpose of any Fraudulent Transfer Law; and

(iii) each Hedge Counterparty has acted in good faith in connection with the guarantee given by
that Restricted Debtor and the transactions contemplated by the Hedging Agreements.

(c) Each Restricted Debtor formed in the state of California acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole
responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers under (and as defined
in) the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as applicable) such
information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers under (and
as defined in) the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Second Lien Facilities Agreement (as
applicable) as such Restricted Debtor requires.

(d) Each Hedge Counterparty agrees that each Restricted Debtor’s liability under this clause is limited
so that no obligation of, or transfer by, any Restricted Debtor under this Clause is subject to
avoidance and turnover under any Fraudulent Transfer Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any Hedging Agreement,
the obligations being guaranteed by any Debtor (by express guarantee, grant of security, or
otherwise) shall not include any Excluded Swap Obligations.

**5.13 Keepwell**

(a) Each ECP Debtor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other
Debtor to honour all of its obligations under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause 5
(Guarantee and indemnity to Hedge Counterparties) in respect of Swap Obligations (provided,
_however, that each ECP Debtor shall only be liable under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) for the_
maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations
under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell), or otherwise under the guarantee provided pursuant to this Clause
5 (Guarantee and indemnity to Hedge Counterparties), voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, or otherwise, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each ECP Debtor under this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) shall remain in full force and
effect until the Hedging Liabilities are discharged in full. Each ECP Debtor intends that this Clause
5.13 (Keepwell) constitutes, and this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell) shall be deemed to constitute, a
“keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Debtor for all purposes of
Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(b) As used in this Clause 5.13 (Keepwell), “ECP Debtor” means, in respect of any Swap Obligation,
each Debtor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant guarantee or grant of
the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or such other
person as constitutes an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act or any
regulations promulgated thereunder and can cause another person to qualify as an “eligible contract
participant” at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the
Commodity Exchange Act.

Documents then outstanding.

Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and any

Second Lien Finance Document being inconsistent in any material respect with the Second Lien
Major Terms.

Payments which had accrued under the High Yield Finance Documents and which would have been

Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt
Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and any
High Yield Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be
waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the High Yield Creditors or
any other Creditor.

amount of the Liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds).

AC-91

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to:

(i) any such discharge of the Multi-account Overdraft Liabilities to the extent that the relevant
discharge represents a reduction from a Permitted Gross Amount of a Multi-account Overdraft

(ii) any Close-Out Netting by a Hedge Counterparty or a Hedging Ancillary Lender;

(iii) any Payment Netting by a Hedge Counterparty or a Hedging Ancillary Lender;

(iv) any Inter-Hedging Agreement Netting by a Hedge Counterparty; and

(v) any Inter-Hedging Ancillary Document Netting by a Hedging Ancillary Lender.

**13.4 Non-cash distributions**

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the Liabilities (other than as contemplated in paragraph (e)(ii)(A) of Clause 17.2
(Distressed Disposals)), the Liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realisation proceeds are actually applied towards the Liabilities.

**13.5 Filing of claims**

Without prejudice to any Ancillary Facility Lender’s right of netting or set-off relating to a Multi-account
Overdraft Facility (to the extent that the netting or set-off represents a reduction from a Permitted Gross
Amount of that Multi-account Overdraft Facility to or towards its Designated Net Amount), after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Creditor irrevocably authorises the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent instructions)), on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) against that Debtor,
Security Grantor or member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that Debtor’s, Security Grantor’s or member of
the Group’s Liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that Debtor’s, Security
Grantor’s or member of the Group’s Liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that Debtor’s, Security Grantor’s or member of the Group’s Liabilities.

**13.6 Creditors’ actions**

Each Creditor will:

(a) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent
_instructions)) reasonably requests in order to give effect to this Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency_
_Event); and_

(b) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this Clause 13 (Effect
_of Insolvency Event) or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent_
_instructions)) requests that a Creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with_
the instructions of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent
_instructions)) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security_
Agent (acting in accordance with Clause 13.7 (Security Agent instructions)) may reasonably require,
although no Notes Trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable
the Security Agent to take such action.

**13.7 Security Agent instructions**

For the purposes of Clause 13.5 (Filing of claims) and Clause 13.6 (Creditors’ actions) the Security Agent
shall act:

(a) (except in relation to the High Yield Liabilities of a HY Issuer or HY Borrower that is not a member
of the Group) on the instructions of the group of Primary Creditors entitled, at that time, to give
instructions under Clause 16.2 (Enforcement instructions) or Clause 16.3 (Manner of enforcement);
or

(b) in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no
actions).

**13.8 US Insolvency Proceedings: “subordination agreement”[6]**

If any Debtor commences a US Insolvency Proceeding, then this Agreement, which the Parties hereto
expressly acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code,
shall be effective during the US Insolvency Proceeding of any such Debtor.

**13.9 US Insolvency Proceedings: Reorganisation securities**

If, in any US Insolvency Proceeding of any Debtor, debt obligations of the reorganised Debtor secured by
liens upon any property of the reorganised Debtor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganisation or
similar dispositive restructuring plan, on account of the Second Lien Liabilities, then the provisions of this
Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with
like effect to the liens securing such debt obligations.

**13.10 US Insolvency Proceedings: recoveries and turnover**

(a) If any Primary Creditor is required in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any US Group Member or
otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay the bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy estate in
any such US Insolvency Proceedings, because such amount was avoided or ordered to be paid or
disgorged for any reason, including because it was found to be a fraudulent or preferential transfer,
any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of
set-off or otherwise then the Liabilities owed to such Primary Creditor shall be reinstated to the
extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the
Senior Secured Discharge Date or the Second Lien Discharge Date (as the case may be), if it shall
otherwise have occurred, shall be deemed not to have occurred.

(b) If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be
reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge,
impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties hereto.

(c) The Creditors and Debtors agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit in any manner that is
inconsistent with this Agreement from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any
distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement, whether by preference or
otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise
allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the
priorities set forth in this Agreement.

**13.11 US Insolvency Proceedings: rights as to Transaction Security and proceeds**

The relative rights as to the Transaction Security and proceeds thereof shall continue after the
commencement of any US Insolvency Proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of such
commencement, provided that:

(a) if, in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any US Group Member, the Senior Lenders (or a subset
thereof) instruct the Security Agent to consent to:

(i) any debtor-in-possession financing under section 364 of the US Bankruptcy Code that is
secured by liens (the “DIP Financing Liens”) senior to or pari passu with the liens securing
the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities (a “Bankruptcy Financing”); or

(ii) the use of cash collateral under section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code (“Section 363 Cash
**Collateral”),**

then each Second Lien Finance Party:

(A) will not object to, oppose or seek to challenge (or support or instruct the Security Agent
or any other person in objecting to, opposing or seeking to challenge) such Bankruptcy
Financing (provided it is a Qualifying Financing), the use of Section 363 Cash
Collateral or any adequate protection granted to the Senior Creditors hereunder; and

6 Clauses 13.8 to 13.14 are subject to review by local counsel.

AC-93


-----

(B) shall not object to subordination of:

(1) any liens securing the Second Lien Liabilities to such DIP Financing Liens; or

(2) any replacement liens provided to such Second Lien Finance Parties as adequate
protection to any replacement liens provided as adequate protection to the Senior
Creditors on the same terms as the liens securing the Second Lien Liabilities are
subordinated to the liens securing the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Hedging
Liabilities; and

(b) a Bankruptcy Financing shall be a “Qualifying Financing” only if:

(i) the priorities in the Transaction Security (including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of the applicable US Insolvency Proceeding) of the Security securing the
Senior Liabilities and the Security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be the same
relative to one another as existed immediately prior to the commencement of the applicable
US Insolvency Proceeding;

(ii) such Bankruptcy Financing does not compel any Debtor to seek confirmation of a specific
plan of reorganisation for which material terms are set forth in the documentation relating to
such Bankruptcy Financing (other than specifying that the Bankruptcy Financing must be paid
in full at consummation of such plan of reorganisation);

(iii) such Bankruptcy Financing does not expressly require the sale, liquidation or disposition of all
or any substantial part of the Transaction Security prior to a default under such Bankruptcy
Financing (other than a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code that meets the
criteria set out in paragraph (c) of Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals)); and

(iv) that to the extent that the Senior Liabilities are provided adequate protection in the form of
replacement collateral, the Second Lien Liabilities shall, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, be provided the same replacement collateral on a junior basis to the Senior
Liabilities; provided, that if the Second Lien Finance Parties are granted adequate protection in
the form of claims under Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, such claims shall be
subordinate in right of payment to any claim of the Senior Creditors (and to the claims of any
lenders providing any Qualifying Financing), and the Second Lien Finance Parties hereby
waive their rights under Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code and agree that such claims
may receive any treatment under a plan of reorganization which may be afforded the Second
Lien Liabilities.

**13.12 US Insolvency Proceedings: Common Transaction Security**

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Security Documents, it is the intent of the
Parties that, solely for the purposes of the classification and allowance of claims in US Insolvency
Proceedings, the liens granted pursuant to the Security Documents constitute two separate and
distinct grants of liens on the Common Transaction Security, with the liens securing the Second Lien
Liabilities being subordinate and junior to the liens securing the Senior Secured Liabilities on the
terms set out in this Agreement.

(b) The Parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that because of, among other things, their
differing rights in the Common Transaction Security, the Senior Secured Liabilities are
fundamentally different from the Second Lien Liabilities and must be separately classified in any
Chapter 11 plan proposed or adopted in a US Insolvency Proceeding of any Debtor.

(c) To give effect to the intent of the Parties as provided in this Clause 13.12, if it is held that the claims
of the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors in respect of the Common Transaction
Security constitute only one class of secured claims (rather than separate classes of senior and
second lien secured claims), then the Second Lien Creditors hereby acknowledge and agree in
connection with any US Insolvency Proceedings:

(i) that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior
secured claims against members of the Group in respect of the Common Transaction Security;

(ii) that to the extent that the aggregate value of the Common Transaction Security is sufficient
(for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Second Lien Creditors), the Senior Creditors
shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal,
pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of Post-Petition Interest
before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien Creditors;

AC-94


-----

(iii) to turn over to the Security Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the
extent necessary to give effect to the intent of this Clause 13.12, even if such turnover has the
effect of reducing recovery of the Second Lien Creditors; and

(iv) until turned over to the Senior Secured Creditors, such amounts will be held in trust for the
Senior Secured Creditors.

**13.13 US Insolvency Proceedings: rights of Second Lien Finance Parties and Senior Creditors**

In connection with any US Insolvency Proceeding:

(a) each of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien Creditors, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, shall retain all rights to vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganisation,
composition, arrangement or liquidation, and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the ability of the Senior Secured Creditors or the Second Lien Creditors to make a
proposal to the Group to provide debtor-in-possession financing (including any Bankruptcy
Financing) in any US Insolvency Proceeding;

(b) the Second Lien Creditors may, in accordance with applicable law, exercise any rights and remedies
against any member of the Group which are available to unsecured creditors in US Insolvency
Proceedings which have commenced in respect of that member of the Group solely to the extent that
such exercise of rights and remedies is not in contravention of and does not have the effect of
contravening the provisions and relevant priorities set forth in this Agreement; and

(c) in the event that any Second Lien Creditor becomes a judgment lien creditor in respect of Charged
Property, such judgment lien shall be subordinated to the Security securing the Senior Secured
Liabilities on the same basis as the other Security securing the Second Lien Liabilities are so
subordinated to such Security securing the Senior Secured Liabilities under this Agreement provided
that any proceeds of any such lien shall be applied in the same way as any amounts received or
recovered by the Secured Parties are required to be applied under the terms of this Agreement.

**13.14 US Insolvency Proceedings: disposal of Transaction Security**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Second Lien Creditors will not contest,
protest, or object, and will be deemed to have consented pursuant to Section 363(f) of the US Bankruptcy
Code, to a disposal of Transaction Security, or the process or procedures for obtaining bids for and
effecting a disposal of Transaction Security (including the right of the Senior Secured Creditors to credit
bid and the retention by the Obligors of professionals in connection with any potential disposal), or any
motion or order in connection with any such disposal, process or procedures, under Section 363 of the US
Bankruptcy Code (or any other provision of the US Bankruptcy Code or applicable US Bankruptcy Law),
if the relevant Agent or Security Agent acting on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors consents to such
disposal, such process or procedures or such motion or order; provided that (a) either (i) pursuant to court
order, the Security of the Second Lien Creditors attach to the net proceeds of the disposal with the same
priority and validity as the Security held by the Second Lien Creditors on such Transaction Security, and
the Security remains subject to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) the net proceeds of a disposal of
Transaction Security received by the Security Agent on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors in excess of
those necessary to achieve the full and final discharge of Senior Secured Liabilities are distributed in
accordance with the UCC and applicable law, and (b) the net cash proceeds of any disposition under
Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code are permanently applied to the Bankruptcy Financing or to the
Senior Secured Liabilities or are set aside for a wind-down, liquidation or similar fund. Nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude the Second Lien Creditors from credit bidding all or any portion of the Second
Lien Liabilities provided that any such bid contemplates the payment in full in cash of all Senior Secured
Liabilities at closing of any such bid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Second Lien Agent, on behalf of
itself and the other Second Lien Creditors it represents, may raise any objections to any such disposal that
could be raised by any creditor of the Obligors whose claims were not secured by any Security on such
Transaction Security, provided such objections are not inconsistent with any other term or provision of this
Agreement and are not based on the status of the Second Lien Agent or the Second Lien Creditors as
secured creditors (without limiting the foregoing, the Second Lien Creditors may not raise any objections
based on rights afforded by Sections 363(e) and (f) of the US Bankruptcy Code to secured creditors (or by
any comparable provision of any US Bankruptcy Law)) with respect to the Security granted to the Second
Lien Creditors.

**13.15 Limitation by Applicable Laws**

permitted by applicable laws.

(b) Nothing in this Clause 13 (Effect of Insolvency Event):

(i) entitles any Party to exercise or require any other Party to exercise such power or voting or
representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or reschedule any
of the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities or the Hedging Liabilities or the Second Lien
Liabilities; or

(ii) shall be deemed to require any Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors, High Yield
Creditors or Unsecured Creditors to hold a meeting of the relevant Creditors or pass any
resolution at such meeting or give any consent pursuant to the terms of the relevant Secured
Debt Documents, High Yield Finance Documents or Unsecured Creditors.

then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security pursuant to
the preceding paragraph (c) and the Majority Second Lien Creditors either give such instructions or

similar proceedings relating to any Debtor or member of the Group or any Security Grantor as
instructed by the Security Agent.

Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals), each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors and Security Grantors waives
all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order
or manner or at any particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of
the enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other Security, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied.

**16.6 Duties owed**

Each of the Secured Parties, Security Grantors and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the
Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the Transaction Security prior to the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any Receiver or Delegate owed to any Second Lien
Finance Party or High Yield Creditor in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of
the exploitation, management or realisation of any of that Transaction Security shall, subject to paragraph
(c) of Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals), be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the
Security Agent, the Receiver or Delegate to the Debtors and Security Grantors under general law.

**16.7 Security held by other Creditors**

If any Transaction Security is held by a Creditor other than the Security Agent, then Creditors may only
enforce that Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group in
accordance with this Clause 16.7 (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed
as references to that Creditor).

**16.8 Consultation Period**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to (i) enforce
the Transaction Security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors
represented in the Instructing Group concerned shall consult with each other Agent and the Security
Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of up to
10 days (or such shorter period as each other Agent and the Security Agent shall agree) (the
“Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period, the Instructing
Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to (A) enforce the Transaction
Security or (B) take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above and the Instructing
Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

(i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

-----

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group
determines in good faith (and notifies each Agent and the Security Agent) that to enter into
such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction
Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(B) the realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

“Exposure” means:

(a) in relation to a Senior Lender, the aggregate amount of its participation (if any, and without double
counting) in all Utilisations outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement at the Enforcement
Date (assuming all contingent liabilities which have become actual liabilities since the Enforcement
Date to have been actual liabilities at the Enforcement Date (but not including, for these purposes
only, any interest that would have accrued from the Enforcement Date to the date of actual maturity
in respect of those liabilities) and assuming any transfer of claims in respect of amounts outstanding
under the Revolving Facility and each Ancillary Facility in accordance with the Senior Facilities
Agreement which has taken place since the Enforcement Date to have taken place at the
Enforcement Date) together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission
owed to it under the Senior Facilities Agreement and amounts owed to it by a Debtor in respect of
any Ancillary Facility but excluding:

(i) any amount owed to it by a Debtor in respect of any Ancillary Facility to the extent that that
amount would not be outstanding but for a breach by that Senior Lender of any provision of
the Senior Facilities Agreement governing that Ancillary Facility;

(ii) any amount owed to it by a Debtor in respect of any Ancillary Facility to the extent (and in the
amount) that SFA Cash Cover has been provided by a Debtor in respect of that amount and is

(iii) any amount outstanding in respect of a Documentary Credit to the extent (and in the amount)
that SFA Cash Cover has been provided by a Debtor in respect of that amount and is available

Enforcement Date, the amount, if any, payable to it under that Hedging Agreement in respect
of that termination or close-out as of the date of termination or close-out (taking into account
any interest accrued on that amount) to the extent that amount is unpaid at the Enforcement
Date (that amount to be certified by the relevant Hedge Counterparty and as calculated in
accordance with the relevant Hedging Agreement); and

(ii) if that Hedge Counterparty has not terminated or closed out any hedging transaction under any
Hedging Agreement on or prior to the Enforcement Date:

(A) if the relevant Hedging Agreement is based on an ISDA Master Agreement, the amount,
if any, which would be payable to it under that Hedging Agreement in respect of that
hedging transaction if the Enforcement Date was deemed to be an Early Termination

is the Defaulting Party (as defined in the relevant ISDA Master Agreement); or

(B) if the relevant Hedging Agreement is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement, the
amount, if any, which would be payable to it under that Hedging Agreement in respect
of that hedging transaction if the Enforcement Date was deemed to be the date on which
an event similar in meaning and effect (under that Hedging Agreement) to an Early

AC-109


-----

Termination Date (as defined in any ISDA Master Agreement) occurred under that
Hedging Agreement for which the relevant Debtor is in a position similar in meaning
and effect (under that Hedging Agreement) to that of a Defaulting Party (under and as
defined in the same ISDA Master Agreement),

that amount, in each case, to be certified by the relevant Hedge Counterparty and as calculated
in accordance with the relevant Hedging Agreement; and

(d) in relation to a Pari Passu Creditor:

(i) in respect of any Pari Passu Debt in which it has a participation (other than Pari Passu Debt in
the form of any notes), the aggregate amount of its participation (if any, and without double
counting) in all utilisations outstanding under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Document at the
Enforcement Date (assuming all contingent liabilities which have become actual liabilities
since the Enforcement Date had become actual liabilities at the Enforcement Date (but not
including, for these purposes only, any interest that would have accrued from the Enforcement
Date to the date of actual maturity in respect of those liabilities) and assuming any transfer of
claims between Pari Passu Creditors under that Pari Passu Debt Document pursuant to any
loss-sharing arrangement in such Pari Passu Debt Document which has taken place since the
Enforcement Date had taken place at the Enforcement Date) together with the aggregate
amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it under such Pari Passu Debt
Document and amounts owed to it by a Debtor in respect of any Ancillary Facility entered into
pursuant to such Pari Passu Debt Document but excluding:

(A) any amount owed to it by a Debtor in respect of any Ancillary Facility to the extent that
that amount would not be outstanding but for a breach by that Pari Passu Creditor of any
provision of that Pari Passu Debt Document governing that Ancillary Facility;

(B) any amount owed to it by a Debtor in respect of any Ancillary Facility to the extent (and
in the amount) that SFA Cash Cover has been provided by a Debtor in respect of that

Passu Creditors at the Enforcement Date.

“Utilisation” has the meaning given to that term in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**19.2 Implementation of equalisation**

The provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation) shall be applied at such time or times after the
Enforcement Date as the Security Agent shall consider appropriate. Without prejudice to the generality of
the preceding sentence, if the provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation) have been applied before all the
Liabilities have matured and/or been finally quantified, the Security Agent may elect to re-apply those
provisions on the basis of revised Exposures and the Senior Secured Creditors shall make appropriate
adjustment payments amongst themselves.

**19.3 Equalisation**

If, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective
Exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate Exposures of all the Senior Secured Creditors at
the Enforcement Date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of Notes Trustee Amounts, to
paragraphs (a) and (c) of Clause 30.2 (Liability)) will make such payments amongst themselves as the
Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking into
account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**19.4 Turnover of enforcement proceeds**

If:

(a) the Security Agent, any Senior Agent, any Pari Passu Debt Representative, any Senior Secured
Notes Representative or Second Lien Representative is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to
pay amounts received pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss or the enforcement of the Transaction Security to the Senior Secured Creditors
and/or the Second Lien Creditors but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such
Creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, are
subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Senior Secured Creditors; and

(b) the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet
occurred (nor would occur after taking into account such payments),

then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Second
Lien Creditors as the Security Agent shall require to place the Senior Secured Creditors in the position they
would have been in had such amounts been available for application against the Senior Secured Liabilities.

**19.5 Notification of Exposure**

Before each occasion on which it intends to implement the provisions of this Clause 19 (Equalisation), the
Security Agent shall send notice to each Hedge Counterparty, the Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior
Lenders), each Senior Secured Notes Representative (on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Creditors) and

Security Agent of, respectively, its Exposure, the Exposure of each Senior Secured Notes Creditor, the
Exposure of each Pari Passu Creditor and the Exposure of each Senior Lender (if any).

**19.6 Default in payment**

If a Creditor fails to make a payment due from it under this Clause 19 (Equalisation), the Security Agent
shall be entitled (but not obliged) to take action on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditor(s) to whom such
payment was to be redistributed (subject to being indemnified to its satisfaction by such Senior Secured
Creditor(s) in respect of costs) but shall have no liability or obligation towards such Senior Secured

**Documents”) on a second or lesser ranking basis.**

**21.3 Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)**

(a) In this Clause 21.3 (Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)):

“Secured Party Claim” means any amount which a Debtor owes to a Secured Party under or in
connection with the Secured Debt Documents.

“Security Agent Claim” has the meaning given to it in paragraph (b) below.

(b) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Security Agent, as an
independent and separate creditor, an amount equal to each Secured Party Claim owed by such
Debtor on the due date of such Secured Party Claim (the “Security Agent Claims”).

(c) Each Security Agent Claim is created on the understanding that the Security Agent must:

(i) share the proceeds of each Security Agent Claim with the other Secured Parties; and

(ii) pay those proceeds to the Secured Parties in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of
_Proceeds)._

(d) The Security Agent may enforce performance of any Security Agent Claim in its own name as an
independent and separate right. This includes any suit, execution, enforcement of security, recovery
of guarantees and applications for and voting in respect of any kind of insolvency proceeding.

(e) Each Secured Party must, at the request of the Security Agent, (i) enforce its Secured Party Claim
and (ii) perform any act required in connection with the enforcement of any Security Agent Claim.
This includes joining in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Security Agent.

(f) Unless the Security Agent fails to enforce a Security Agent Claim within a reasonable time after its
due date, a Secured Party may not take any action to enforce the corresponding Secured Party Claim
unless it is requested to do so by the Security Agent.

AC-116


-----

(g) Each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to require a Secured Party
to join in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Security Agent in respect of any Security Agent
Claim.

Secured Party Claims.

(l) A defect affecting a Secured Party Claim against a debtor will not affect any Security Agent Claim.

(m) If the Security Agent returns to any Debtor, whether in any kind of insolvency proceedings or
otherwise, any recovery in respect of which it has made a payment to a Secured Party, that Secured
Party must repay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent.

(n) Without limiting or affecting the Security Agent’s rights against any Debtor (whether under this
Clause 21.3 (Parallel Debt (Covenant to pay the Security Agent)) or under any other provision of the
Secured Debt Documents or High Yield Finance Documents), the Security Agent agrees with each
other Secured Party (on a several and divided basis) that it will not exercise its rights in respect of
the Security Agent Claims except with the consent of the Instructing Group. However, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in the previous sentence shall in any way limit the Security Agent’s
right to act in the protection or preservation of rights under any Transaction Security Document or to
enforce any Transaction Security as contemplated by this Agreement, the relevant Transaction
Security Document or any other Secured Debt Documents or High Yield Finance Documents (or to
do any act reasonably incidental to the foregoing).

opinion of counsel or opinion of another qualified expert, at the expense of the Company or another
Debtor.

**33.** **QFC CREDIT SUPPORT**

To the extent that the Secured Debt Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any
Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit

respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together
with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such
Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the
Secured Debt Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the
State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes

and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported
QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the
transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the
laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act
Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, Default Rights under the Secured Debt Documents that might otherwise apply to such
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the
U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Secured Debt Documents were
governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a
Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported
QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 33, the following terms have the following meanings:

“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in

“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and

and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined
in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

(b) The Parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and convenient courts to settle

Security Grantor and each Subordinated Creditor (unless incorporated in England and Wales):

proceedings before the English courts in connection with this Agreement; and

(ii) agrees that failure by a process agent to notify the relevant Debtor, Security Grantor or
Subordinated Creditor, as applicable, of the process will not invalidate the proceedings
concerned.

(b) If any person appointed as an agent for service of process is unable for any reason to act as agent for
service of process, the Company (on behalf of all the Debtors, Security Grantors and Subordinated
Creditors) must immediately (and in any event within five Business Days of becoming aware of such

above.

12. The first Interest Period to apply to the Facility W Advance will be a period running from (and including)

cent. and such fixed rate of [Š] per cent. per annum and that no obligation to pay any Break Costs shall

prepayment. Such payment shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account
of the Additional Facility W Lender) on the actual date of such mandatory prepayment.

19. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of any of Facility W by the
Borrower under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement (other than a voluntary
prepayment complying with paragraph 22, 23 or 24 below) in an amount not to exceed 10% of the original

interest then due on the amount of Facility W prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment. Such
payment shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional
Facility W Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment. Prior to [Š], to the extent that during any
twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, the principal amount of Facility W prepaid in one or
more voluntary prepayments is greater than an amount equal to 10% of the original principal amount of
Facility W (such original principal amount to include any upsizing of Facility W pursuant to paragraph 25
below) (any such amount, the “Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Borrower will apply the Excess
Early Redemption Proceeds to a voluntary prepayment of Facility W as described in paragraph 20 below.

20. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility W by
the Borrower under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with any Excess Early
Redemption Proceeds (other than a voluntary prepayment complying with paragraph 22, 23 or 24 below),
the Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility W Lender) an
amount equal to the Additional Amount (as defined below), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the amount
of Facility W prepaid, in each case, to, and including the due date of prepayment. Such payment shall be
due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility W
Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

For the purposes of this paragraph 20:

“Additional Amount” means, with respect to Facility W, on any prepayment date applicable to the
voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility W, the excess of:

(a) the present value at such prepayment date of (i) the amount that would be payable in accordance
with paragraph 21 below in respect of the principal amount of Facility W being prepaid if such
amount were prepaid on [Š] pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement
exclusive of any accrued but unpaid interest, plus (ii) the principal amount of Facility W being
prepaid plus (iii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on the principal amount of
Facility W being prepaid through [Š] (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to, and including, the
prepayment date and assuming such interest payments are calculated at the rate of interest on
Facility W in effect on such prepayment date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury
Rate plus 50 basis points; over

(b) the principal amount of Facility W being prepaid.

“Treasury Rate” means, as of any prepayment date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation of
U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal
Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) which has become publicly available on a day no earlier than two
Business Days prior to the date of the relevant prepayment notice (or, if such statistical release is not so
published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Additional
Facility W Lender in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the prepayment date to [Š];
provided, however, that if the period from the prepayment date to [Š] is not equal to the constant maturity
of a U.S. Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained
by a linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of
U.S. Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the prepayment date
to [Š] is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to
a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

21. On or after [Š], upon the occurrence of a voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility W by the Borrower
under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement (other than a voluntary prepayment
complying with paragraphs 22, 23 or 24 below), the Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the
account of the Additional Facility W Lender) an amount equal to the relevant percentages of the principal
amount of Facility W being prepaid as set out in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due
on the amount of Facility W prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment, if prepaid during the
twelve-month period beginning on [Š] of the years indicated below.

22. Notwithstanding paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 above:

(a) if the Additional Facility W Lender purchases any Notes in connection with any tender offer or other
offer to purchase the Notes (a “Tender Offer”), the Borrower will prepay an aggregate principal
amount of Facility W based on the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in such Tender
Offer and at a prepayment price of par plus any premium paid or less any discount received by the
Additional Facility W Lender in connection with the purchase of the Notes in such Tender Offer,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, and including, the due date of such prepayment; and

(b) if following any Tender Offer, the Additional Facility W Lender is entitled to, and elects to, redeem
any remaining Notes at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder in such Tender Offer, then
the Borrower will prepay the remaining principal amount of Facility W at a prepayment price of par
plus any premium paid or less any discount received by the Additional Facility W Lender in
connection with the purchase of the Notes in such Tender Offer, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
to, and including, the date that any interest accrues under the Notes in connection with such
redemption.

23. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of Facility W by the Borrower
pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with the Net Cash Proceeds of one
or more Equity Offerings (each as defined below) (the “Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds”)
in an amount of up to 40% of the original principal amount of Facility W (such original principal amount
to include any upsizing of Facility W pursuant to paragraph 25 below), the Borrower shall make a payment
to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility W Lender) in an amount (the “Equity
**Claw Prepayment Premium”) equal to [Š]% of the principal amount of Facility W prepaid, plus accrued**
and unpaid interest then due on the amount of Facility W prepaid to, and including, the due date of
prepayment. Such payment shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account
of the Additional Facility W Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment provided that:

(a) at least 50% of the original principal amount of Facility W (such original principal amount to include
any upsizing of Facility W pursuant to paragraph 25 below) remains outstanding immediately after

(i) only the portion of Capital Stock which so matures or is mandatorily redeemable, is so
convertible or exchangeable or is so redeemable at the option of the holder thereof prior to
such date will be deemed to be Disqualified Stock; and

(ii) any Capital Stock that would constitute Disqualified Stock solely because the holders thereof
have the right to require the Company or any Permitted Affiliate Parent to repurchase such
Capital Stock upon the occurrence of a change of control or asset sale shall not constitute
Disqualified Stock if the terms of such Capital Stock (and all such securities into which it is
convertible or for which it is ratable or exchangeable) provide that the Company or any
Permitted Affiliate Parent may not purchase or redeem any such Capital Stock (and all such

date of prepayment.

25. (a) Provided that any upsizing of Facility W permitted under this paragraph 25 will not breach any term
of the Credit Agreement, Facility W may be upsized by any amount, by the signing of one or more
further Additional Facility W Accession Deeds, that specify (along with the other terms specified
therein) VMED O2 UK Holdco 4 Limited as the sole Borrower and which specify Facility W
Commitments denominated in U.S. dollars, to be drawn in U.S. dollars, with the same Final Maturity

28. The Additional Facility W Lender, the Borrower and the Facility Agent acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Facility W Advances shall be made by the Additional Facility W Lender directly to the Borrower to an

Credit Agreement, each of the Borrower and the Company hereby irrevocably consent to any assignment,
transfer or novation made by the Additional Facility W Lender by way of security in favour of BNY
Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited (as security trustee under the Indenture). The Additional

under the terms of any agreement that is binding on it or any of its assets.

31. Subject to paragraph 33 below and the provisions of the Indenture, for the purposes of any amendment or
waiver, consent or other modification (including with respect to any existing Default or Event of Default)
that may be sought by the Parent or the Company under the Credit Agreement or any other Relevant
Finance Document on or after the date of this Additional Facility W Accession Deed, the Additional
Facility W Lender hereby consents (in its capacity as a Lender from time to time under the Credit
Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a Hedge Counterparty), and agrees to
procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates or Related Funds that are Lenders

consequential amendments, waivers, consents or modifications),

and this Additional Facility W Accession Deed shall constitute the irrevocable and unconditional written
consent of the Additional Facility W Lender (in the capacity of a Lender, and if it is a Hedge Counterparty,
in the capacity of a Hedge Counterparty) and the agreement of the Additional Facility W Lender to
procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that each of its Affiliates and Related Funds that is a Lender
under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility or a Hedge Counterparty
provides irrevocable and unconditional written consent in that capacity in respect of such amendments,
waivers, consents or other modifications to the Relevant Finance Documents for the purposes of Clause 42
(Amendments) of the Credit Agreement, Clause 21 (Remedies, Waivers & Amendments) of the Group

Agreement (as applicable), and any clause in any other Relevant Finance Document relating to
amendments of that Relevant Finance Document, without any further action required on the part of any
party thereto.

32. The Additional Facility W Lender hereby waives (in its capacity as a Lender from time to time under the
Credit Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a Hedge Counterparty), and agrees
to procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates and Related Funds that are
Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility or Hedge
Counterparties waives (in their capacity as Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility
that is a revolving facility or Hedge Counterparties, as applicable) receipt of any fee in connection with the
foregoing consents, notwithstanding that other consenting Lenders under the Credit Agreement (including
the Additional Facility W Lender in relation to any upsizing of Facility W pursuant to paragraph 25) or
Hedge Counterparties under the Group Intercreditor Agreement or HYD Intercreditor Agreement may be
paid a fee in consideration of such Lenders’ or Hedge Counterparties’ consent to any or all of the foregoing
amendments, waivers, consents or other modifications.

33. Following receipt of an amendment request from the Company and/or the Facility Agent in connection
with all or any of the proposed amendments set out in paragraph 31 above (the “Requested
**Amendments”), the Additional Facility W Lender shall confirm whether, having regard to the relevant**
provisions of the Indenture, it is required to consent to the Requested Amendments. If the Additional
Facility W Lender is required to give such consent, it hereby acknowledges and agrees (in its capacity as a
Lender from time to time under the Credit Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a
Hedge Counterparty), and agrees to procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates
and Related Funds that are Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving

Facility or Additional Facility that is a revolving facility or Hedge Counterparties, as applicable) that the
Facility Agent and/or the Security Trustee may, but shall not be required to, send to it any further formal
amendment request in connection with all, or any of the Requested Amendments and the Facility Agent
and/or the Security Trustee (as applicable) shall be authorised to consent on behalf of it, as a Lender under
one or more Facilities and as a Hedge Counterparty under the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement, to any such Requested Amendments (and the Facility Agent and/or the Security
Trustee shall be authorised to enter into any necessary documentation in connection with the same), and
such consent shall be taken into account in calculating whether the Instructing Group, or the relevant
requisite Lenders, or the Hedge Counterparties, have consented to the relevant amendment, waiver or other
modification in accordance with Clause 42 (Amendments) of the Credit Agreement, Clause 21 (Remedies,
_Waivers & Amendments) of the Group Intercreditor Agreement or Clause 15 (Remedies, Waivers &_

in any other Relevant Finance Document.

34.
(a) The Company confirms for itself and, in its capacity as Obligors’ Agent, on behalf of each other
Guarantor that the obligations of each Guarantor under Clause 28 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of the
Credit Agreement continue to apply for the benefit of the Relevant Finance Parties under the
Relevant Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, extend to all Additional Facilities and
the Facility W Commitment and further confirms that the security created by each of the Obligors
under the Security Documents extends to secure liabilities under all Additional Facilities including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Facility W Commitments.

(b) Notwithstanding that the Security Trustee may not sign this Additional Facility W Accession Deed,
the Security Trustee shall be entitled to rely on paragraph 34(a) and enforce any of its rights in its

AD-9

capacity as security trustee for and on behalf of the Relevant Finance Parties which may arise in
respect of such paragraph pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and the Group Intercreditor
Agreement.

35. The Additional Facility W Lender confirms to each other Finance Party that:

(a) it has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs
of each Obligor and such Obligor’s related entities in connection with its participation in Facility W
being made available pursuant to this Additional Facility W Accession Deed and has not relied on
any information provided to it by any other Finance Party in connection with any Relevant Finance
Document; and

(b) it will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and
such Obligor’s related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under the Credit
Agreement or any Additional Facility Commitment is in force.

36. The Additional Facility W Lender represents and warrants to the Facility Agent and to each UK Borrower
that:

(a) as at the date of this Additional Facility W Accession Deed, it is a UK Non-Bank Lender and falls
within paragraph (a) of the definition of UK Non-Bank Lender; and

(b) unless it notifies the Facility Agent and the Company to the contrary in writing prior to any such
date, its representation and warranty in paragraph (a) above is true in relation to the Additional
Facility W Lender’s participation in each Advance made to such Borrowers, on each date that such
UK Borrower makes a payment of interest in relation to such Advance.

37. Other than with respect to the security assignment agreement to be entered into between the Additional
Facility W Lender and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as security trustee on or around
the date hereof, the Additional Facility W Lender agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent
of the Company (acting in its sole discretion), effect any transfer, assignment or Sub-participation of any of
its rights, benefits or obligations in respect of any Facility W Commitment under this Additional Facility
W Accession Deed prior to the date that such Facility W Commitment has been utilised. The Additional
Facility W Lender agrees that, without prejudice to Clause 36.8 (Transfer Deed) or Clause 36.9 (Transfer
_Agreement) of the Credit Agreement, as applicable, each New Lender shall become, by the execution by_
the Facility Agent of either (a) a Transfer Deed substantially in the form set out in the Credit Agreement or
(b) a Transfer Agreement substantially in the form set out in the Credit Agreement, as applicable, bound by
the terms of this Additional Facility W Accession Deed as if it were an original party hereto as the
Additional Facility W Lender and shall acquire the same rights, grant the same consents and assume the
same obligations towards the other parties to this Additional Facility W Accession Deed as would have
been acquired, granted and assumed had the New Lender been an original party to this Additional Facility
W Accession Deed as the Additional Facility W Lender.

38. The Additional Facility W Lender acknowledges and agrees that the Lender Asset Security Release
Confirmation has been delivered by the Facility Agent to the Lenders and that the Security Trustee is
therefore irrevocably authorised in accordance with Clause 42.8(a) (Asset Security Release) of the Credit
Agreement to execute such documents as may be required to ensure that the Security (other than any
Security required to be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is released.

39. The Facility Office and address for notices of the Additional Facility W Lender for the purposes of Clause
39 (Notices and Delivery of Information) of the Credit Agreement will be that notified by the Additional
Facility W Lender to the Facility Agent.

40. If a term of this Additional Facility W Accession Deed is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
any respect under any jurisdiction, that will not affect:

(a) the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other term of this Additional Facility
W Accession Deed; or

(b) the legality, validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of that or any other term of this
Additional Facility W Accession Deed.

41. Clause 46 (Jurisdiction) of the Credit Agreement is incorporated into this Additional Facility W Accession
Deed as if set out in full and as if references in that clause to “this Agreement” or a “Relevant Finance
Document” are references to this Additional Facility W Accession Deed.

amount of Facility V, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, and including, the due date of mandatory
prepayment. Such payment shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account
of the Additional Facility V Lender) on the actual date of such mandatory prepayment.

19. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of any of Facility V by the
Borrower under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement (other than a voluntary
prepayment complying with paragraph 22, 23 or 24 below) in an amount not to exceed 10% of the original
principal amount of Facility V (such original principal amount to include any upsizing of Facility V
pursuant to paragraph 25 below) during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, the
Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility V Lender) an
amount equal to 3.0% of the principal amount of Facility V being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest

then due on the amount of Facility V prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment. Such payment
shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility
V Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment. Prior to [Š], to the extent that during any twelve-month
period commencing on the Issue Date, the principal amount of Facility V prepaid in one or more voluntary
prepayments is greater than an amount equal to 10% of the original principal amount of Facility V (such
original principal amount to include any upsizing of Facility V pursuant to paragraph 25 below) (any such
amount, the “Excess Early Redemption Proceeds”), the Borrower will apply the Excess Early
Redemption Proceeds to a voluntary prepayment of Facility V as described in paragraph 20 below.

20. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility V by
the Borrower under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with any Excess Early
Redemption Proceeds (other than a voluntary prepayment complying with paragraph 22, 23 or 24 below),
the Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility V Lender) an
amount equal to the Additional Amount (as defined below), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the amount
of Facility V prepaid, in each case, to, and including the due date of prepayment. Such payment shall be
due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility V
Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

For the purposes of this paragraph 20:

“Additional Amount” means, with respect to Facility V, on any prepayment date applicable to the
voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility V, the excess of:

(a) the present value at such prepayment date of (i) the amount that would be payable in accordance
with paragraph 21 below in respect of the principal amount of Facility V being prepaid if such
amount were prepaid on [Š] pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement
exclusive of any accrued but unpaid interest, plus (ii) the principal amount of Facility V being
prepaid plus (iii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on the principal amount of
Facility V being prepaid through [Š] (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to, and including, the
prepayment date and assuming such interest payments are calculated at the rate of interest on
Facility V in effect on such prepayment date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Gilt Rate
plus 50 basis points; over

(b) the principal amount of Facility V being prepaid.

“Gilt Rate” means, as of any prepayment date, the yield to maturity as of the prepayment date of UK
Government Obligations with a fixed maturity (as compiled by the Office for National Statistics and
published in the most recent Financial Statistics that has become publicly available on a day no earlier than
two Business Days prior to the date of the delivery of the cancellation notice in respect of the prepayment
date (or, if such Financial Statistics are no longer published, any publicly available source of similar
market data selected by the Additional Facility S Lender in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period
from the prepayment date to [Š]; provided that if the period from the prepayment date to [Š] is not equal to
the fixed maturity of UK Government Obligations for which a yield is given, the Gilt Rate shall be
obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of UK
Government Obligations for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the prepayment
date to [Š] is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded UK Government Obligations
denominated in sterling adjusted to a fixed maturity of one year shall be used.

“UK Government Obligations” means sovereign obligations of the United Kingdom for the timely
payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged, in each case which are payable in sterling and not
callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof.

21. On or after [Š], upon the occurrence of a voluntary prepayment of any or all of Facility V by the Borrower
under Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement (other than a voluntary prepayment
complying with paragraphs 22, 23 or 24 below), the Borrower agrees to pay to the Facility Agent (for the
account of the Additional Facility V Lender) an amount equal to the relevant percentages of the principal
amount of Facility V being prepaid as set out in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due

22. Notwithstanding paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 above:

(a) if the Additional Facility V Lender purchases any Notes in connection with any tender offer or other
offer to purchase the Notes (a “Tender Offer”), the Borrower will prepay an aggregate principal
amount of Facility V based on the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in such Tender
Offer and at a prepayment price of par plus any premium paid or less any discount received by the
Additional Facility V Lender in connection with the purchase of the Notes in such Tender Offer, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest to, and including, the due date of such prepayment; and

(b) if following any Tender Offer, the Additional Facility V Lender is entitled to, and elects to, redeem
any remaining Notes at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder in such Tender Offer, then
the Borrower will prepay the remaining principal amount of Facility V at a prepayment price of par
plus any premium paid or less any discount received by the Additional Facility V Lender in
connection with the purchase of the Notes in such Tender Offer, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
to, and including, the date that any interest accrues under the Notes in connection with such
redemption.

23. At any time prior to [Š], upon the occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of Facility V by the Borrower
pursuant to Clause 11 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with the Net Cash Proceeds of one
or more Equity Offerings (each as defined below) (the “Equity Offering Early Redemption Proceeds”)
in an amount of up to 40% of the original principal amount of Facility V (such original principal amount to
include any upsizing of Facility V pursuant to paragraph 25 below), the Borrower shall make a payment to
the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility V Lender) in an amount (the “Equity Claw
**Prepayment Premium”) equal to [Š]% of the principal amount of Facility V prepaid, plus accrued and**
unpaid interest then due on the amount of Facility V prepaid to, and including, the due date of prepayment.
Such payment shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the
Additional Facility V Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment provided that:

(a) at least 50% of the original principal amount of Facility V (such original principal amount to include
any upsizing of Facility V pursuant to paragraph 25 below) remains outstanding immediately after
any such prepayment; and

(b) such prepayment is made not more than 180 days after the consummation of any such Equity
Offering.

-----

_provided that:_

(i) only the portion of Capital Stock which so matures or is mandatorily redeemable, is so
convertible or exchangeable or is so redeemable at the option of the holder thereof prior to
such date will be deemed to be Disqualified Stock; and

(ii) any Capital Stock that would constitute Disqualified Stock solely because the holders thereof
have the right to require the Company or any Permitted Affiliate Parent to repurchase such
Capital Stock upon the occurrence of a change of control or asset sale shall not constitute
Disqualified Stock if the terms of such Capital Stock (and all such securities into which it is
convertible or for which it is ratable or exchangeable) provide that the Company or any
Permitted Affiliate Parent may not purchase or redeem any such Capital Stock (and all such
securities into which it is convertible or for which it is ratable or exchangeable) pursuant to

provisions of the Credit Agreement.

or any Permitted Affiliate Parent is a Subsidiary on the Issue Date, (c) any other person of which the

connection therewith, the Borrower will prepay 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of Facility
V, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due on the amount of Facility V prepaid to, and including, the due
date of prepayment free of any additional premium or penalty. Such payment shall be due and payable by
the Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility V Lender) on the actual date
of prepayment.

25. (a) Provided that any upsizing of Facility V permitted under this paragraph 25 will not breach any term
of the Credit Agreement, Facility V may be upsized by any amount, by the signing of one or more
further Additional Facility V Accession Deeds, that specify (along with the other terms specified

AE-7

any Facility V Advance) pursuant to Clause 10.4 (Right of Repayment and Cancellation in Relation to a

Agreement, each of the Borrower and the Company hereby irrevocably consent to any assignment, transfer
or novation made by the Additional Facility V Lender by way of security in favour of BNY Mellon

Lender may only deliver to the Facility Agent a completed Transfer Deed or Transfer Agreement (as
applicable) if at that time it confirms to the Facility Agent in writing that an assignment, transfer or
novation of the interest in Facility V to be assigned, transferred or novated is not prohibited under the
terms of any agreement that is binding on it or any of its assets.

31. Subject to paragraph 33 below and the provisions of the Indenture, for the purposes of any amendment or
waiver, consent or other modification (including with respect to any existing Default or Event of Default)
that may be sought by the Parent or the Company under the Credit Agreement or any other Relevant
Finance Document on or after the date of this Additional Facility V Accession Deed, the Additional
Facility V Lender hereby consents (in its capacity as a Lender from time to time under the Credit
Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a Hedge Counterparty), and agrees to
procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates or Related Funds that are Lenders

through a series of amendments, to the Credit Agreement or any other Relevant Finance Document
to be made to conform any Relevant Finance Document to any Liberty Global Reference Agreement
(provided that any amendment, waiver, consent or modification to conform the Credit Agreement or
any other Relevant Finance Document to any Liberty Global Reference Agreement referred to at
paragraphs (v) to (xiii) (inclusive) of that definition shall be limited to those that are mechanical in
nature unless specifically referenced in the Approved Amendments and, in each case, any
consequential amendments, waivers, consents or modifications),

consent of the Additional Facility V Lender (in the capacity of a Lender, and if it is a Hedge Counterparty,
in the capacity of a Hedge Counterparty) and the agreement of the Additional Facility V Lender to procure,
unless it is prohibited from doing so, that each of its Affiliates and Related Funds that is a Lender under a
Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility or a Hedge Counterparty provides
irrevocable and unconditional written consent in that capacity in respect of such amendments, waivers,
consents or other modifications to the Relevant Finance Documents for the purposes of Clause 42
(Amendments) of the Credit Agreement, Clause 21 (Remedies, Waivers & Amendments) of the Group

Agreement (as applicable), and any clause in any other Relevant Finance Document relating to
amendments of that Relevant Finance Document, without any further action required on the part of any
party thereto.

32. The Additional Facility V Lender hereby waives (in its capacity as a Lender from time to time under the
Credit Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a Hedge Counterparty), and agrees
to procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates and Related Funds that are
Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving facility or Hedge
Counterparties waives (in their capacity as Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility
that is a revolving facility or Hedge Counterparties, as applicable) receipt of any fee in connection with the
foregoing consents, notwithstanding that other consenting Lenders under the Credit Agreement (including
the Additional Facility V Lender in relation to any upsizing of Facility V pursuant to paragraph 25) or
Hedge Counterparties under the Group Intercreditor Agreement or HYD Intercreditor Agreement may be
paid a fee in consideration of such Lenders’ or Hedge Counterparties’ consent to any or all of the foregoing
amendments, waivers, consents or other modifications.

with all or any of the proposed amendments set out in paragraph 31 above (the “Requested
**Amendments”), the Additional Facility V Lender shall confirm whether, having regard to the relevant**
provisions of the Indenture, it is required to consent to the Requested Amendments. If the Additional
Facility V Lender is required to give such consent, it hereby acknowledges and agrees (in its capacity as a
Lender from time to time under the Credit Agreement and, if it is a Hedge Counterparty, in its capacity as a
Hedge Counterparty), and agrees to procure, unless it is prohibited from doing so, that any of its Affiliates
and Related Funds that are Lenders under a Revolving Facility or an Additional Facility that is a revolving

amendment request in connection with all, or any of the Requested Amendments and the Facility Agent
and/or the Security Trustee (as applicable) shall be authorised to consent on behalf of it, as a Lender under
one or more Facilities and as a Hedge Counterparty under the Group Intercreditor Agreement and the HYD
Intercreditor Agreement, to any such Requested Amendments (and the Facility Agent and/or the Security
Trustee shall be authorised to enter into any necessary documentation in connection with the same), and
such consent shall be taken into account in calculating whether the Instructing Group, or the relevant
requisite Lenders, or the Hedge Counterparties, have consented to the relevant amendment, waiver or other
modification in accordance with Clause 42 (Amendments) of the Credit Agreement, Clause 21 (Remedies,

AE-9

(a) The Company confirms for itself and, in its capacity as Obligors’ Agent, on behalf of each other
Guarantor that the obligations of each Guarantor under Clause 28 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of the
Credit Agreement continue to apply for the benefit of the Relevant Finance Parties under the
Relevant Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, extend to all Additional Facilities and

under the Security Documents extends to secure liabilities under all Additional Facilities including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Facility V Commitments.

(b) Notwithstanding that the Security Trustee may not sign this Additional Facility V Accession Deed,
the Security Trustee shall be entitled to rely on paragraph 34(a) and enforce any of its rights in its
capacity as security trustee for and on behalf of the Relevant Finance Parties which may arise in

Agreement.

35. The Additional Facility V Lender confirms to each other Finance Party that:

(a) it has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs
of each Obligor and such Obligor’s related entities in connection with its participation in Facility V
being made available pursuant to this Additional Facility V Accession Deed and has not relied on
any information provided to it by any other Finance Party in connection with any Relevant Finance
Document; and

(b) it will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and
such Obligor’s related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under the Credit
Agreement or any Additional Facility Commitment is in force.

36. The Additional Facility V Lender represents and warrants to the Facility Agent and to each UK Borrower
that:

(a) as at the date of this Additional Facility V Accession Deed, it is a UK Non-Bank Lender and falls
within paragraph (a) of the definition of UK Non-Bank Lender; and

(b) unless it notifies the Facility Agent and the Company to the contrary in writing prior to any such
date, its representation and warranty in paragraph (a) above is true in relation to the Additional
Facility V Lender’s participation in each Advance made to such Borrowers, on each date that such
UK Borrower makes a payment of interest in relation to such Advance.

37. Other than with respect to the security assignment agreement to be entered into between the Additional
Facility V Lender and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as security trustee on or around
the date hereof, the Additional Facility V Lender agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of
the Company (acting in its sole discretion), effect any transfer, assignment or Sub-participation of any of
its rights, benefits or obligations in respect of any Facility V Commitment under this Additional Facility V
Accession Deed prior to the date that such Facility V Commitment has been utilised. The Additional
Facility V Lender agrees that, without prejudice to Clause 36.8 (Transfer Deed) or Clause 36.9 (Transfer
_Agreement) of the Credit Agreement, as applicable, each New Lender shall become, by the execution by_
the Facility Agent of either (a) a Transfer Deed substantially in the form set out in the Credit Agreement or
(b) a Transfer Agreement substantially in the form set out in the Credit Agreement, as applicable, bound by
the terms of this Additional Facility V Accession Deed as if it were an original party hereto as the
Additional Facility V Lender and shall acquire the same rights, grant the same consents and assume the
same obligations towards the other parties to this Additional Facility V Accession Deed as would have
been acquired, granted and assumed had the New Lender been an original party to this Additional Facility
V Accession Deed as the Additional Facility V Lender.

38. The Additional Facility V Lender acknowledges and agrees that the Lender Asset Security Release
Confirmation has been delivered by the Facility Agent to the Lenders and that the Security Trustee is
therefore irrevocably authorised in accordance with Clause 42.8(a) (Asset Security Release) of the Credit
Agreement to execute such documents as may be required to ensure that the Security (other than any
Security required to be granted under paragraph (b) of the definition of “80% Security Test”) is released.

**IT IS AGREED as follows:**

**1.** **INTERPRETATION**

**1.1** **Definitions**

(a) In this Deed:

“Effective Date” means the date on which the Effective Date Senior Agent notifies the Company
that it has received all of the documents set out in Schedule 1 (Conditions precedent) to this Deed in
form and substance satisfactory to the Effective Date Senior Agent (acting reasonably). The
Effective Date Senior Agent must give this notification as soon as reasonably practicable;

“Finance Documents” has the meaning given to such term in the Original Senior Facilities
Agreement; and

“Party” means a party to this Deed.

(b) Capitalised terms defined in the Amended Group ICA have, unless expressly defined in this
Deed, the same meaning in this Deed.

**1.2** **Construction**

(a) The provisions of Clause 1.2 (Construction) of the Group ICA apply to this Deed as though they
were set out in full in this Deed except that references to “this Agreement” are to be construed as
references to this Deed.

(b) Where paragraph or Clause numbers in the Group ICA, the High Yield ICA or the Security Trust
Agreement are referred to in any other Finance Document in force on the Effective Date, to the
extent such paragraph or Clause has been superseded by the Amended Group ICA pursuant to
Clause 2(a) (Amendment of the Group ICA, High Yield ICA and Security Trust Agreement) of this
Deed, such paragraph or Clause numbers shall be read and construed, for the purpose of the relevant
Finance Document only, so that the equivalent provision in the Amended Group ICA is instead
referred to in each such Finance Document.

(c) Subject to Clause 2(b) (Amendment of the Group ICA, High Yield ICA and Security Trust
Agreement) of this Deed and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Finance
Document entered into prior to the Effective Date, in the case of any inconsistency or conflict
between the terms of any Finance Document and the Amended Group ICA, the terms and provisions
of the Amended Group ICA shall prevail.

(d) Where paragraph or Clause numbers have changed in the Original Senior Facilities Agreement as a
result of amendments to the Original Senior Facilities Agreement prior to the Effective Date, and
such paragraph and Clause numbers are referred to in any other Finance Document in force on the
Effective Date, such paragraph or Clause numbers shall be read and construed in the Original Senior
Facilities Agreement, for the purposes of the relevant Finance Document only, so that the equivalent
provision in the Original Senior Facilities Agreement (as at the Effective Date) is instead referred to
in each such Finance Document.

**2.** **AMENDMENT** **OF** **THE** **GROUP** **ICA,** **HIGH** **YIELD** **ICA** **AND** **SECURITY** **TRUST**
**AGREEMENT**

(a) With effect on and from the Effective Date, the Group ICA, the High Yield ICA and the Security
Trust Agreement will be supplemented and amended and restated by this Deed so that they shall then

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, to the extent relevant in respect of any Pre-Effective Date
Security Documents, the definitions of “Beneficiaries”, “Designated Secured Obligations” and
“Secured Obligations” (in the Group ICA and the Security Trust Agreement) and all other
definitions in the Group ICA and Security Trust Agreement (to the extent they are used within the

AE-46

Group ICA and Security Trust Agreement) shall remain in full force and effect.

the Amended Group ICA are made on the date of this Deed by each Effective Date Intra-Group

_Agreement) of this Deed, continue to extend to the Secured Obligations, under and as_
defined in paragraph [(a) or (b)] of that definition (as applicable) in the Amended Group
ICA; and

(ii) any guarantee or indemnity created or given by it under the Original Senior Facilities
Agreement will continue in full force and effect on the terms of the respective Finance
Documents (including the Amended Group ICA) and extend to all new obligations assumed
by any Debtor under the Finance Documents as amended and restated by this Deed (including,
but not limited to, any new obligations under the Amended Group ICA), subject to any
applicable guarantee limitations set out in any relevant Finance Documents.

**6.** **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

(a) On the Effective Date, the High Yield Notes Trustee (in its capacity as High Yield Trustee under,
and as defined in, the High Yield ICA) agrees and acknowledges that it shall cease to be a party to
