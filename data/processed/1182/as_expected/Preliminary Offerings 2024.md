**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

This offering circular has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of the
Notes described herein to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs under Rule 144A and to persons outside the
United States under Regulation S. This offering circular is confidential and personal to each offeree and does not
constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the Notes.
Distribution of this offering circular to any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any, retained to advise
such offeree with respect to this offering circular is unauthorized and any disclosure of any of its contents without
our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you agree to the foregoing and
not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering circular or any documents delivered in connection
with this offering circular.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained in this offering circular, and nothing contained in this offering circular is,
nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

The information contained in this offering circular is as of the date of this offering circular and is subject to
change, completion or amendment without notice. Neither the delivery of this offering circular at any time nor the
offer, sale or delivery of any Note shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no
change in the information contained in this offering circular or in our affairs since the date of this offering circular.

No person is authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or to make any
representation not contained in this offering circular, and, if given or made, such other information or representation
must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuer or the initial purchasers or any of the Issuer’s or the
initial purchasers’ representative.

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission**
**nor any other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this**
**offering circular is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties
and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering circular. We and the initial purchasers are
not making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted.

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for
offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering
circular and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering circular or any of the Notes
are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable
laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission
required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction
to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers
will have any responsibility therefor.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or
exemption therefrom. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the
financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer
Restrictions.”

The offering is being made on the basis of this offering circular and is subject to the terms described in this
offering circular and the indenture relating to the Notes. In making an investment decision, prospective investors
must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks
involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering circular as legal, business or tax advice.


-----

Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to
determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable legal investment or similar laws
or regulations.

Each prospective investor must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction
in which it purchases, offers or sells Notes or possesses or distributes this offering circular and must obtain any
consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of Notes under the laws and
regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and
none of we, the initial purchasers or their representative shall have any responsibility therefor.

We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes
in any automated dealer quotation system. The Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. We expect
that the Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited
with the registrar, as custodian for DTC as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee
of such depositary. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in
the global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. After the initial
issuance of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited
circumstances set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and the Issuer and the initial
purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Issuer and
the initial purchasers also reserve the right to allot to you less than the full amount of Notes sought by you. The
initial purchasers and certain related entities may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market.
These transactions may include over-allotment, covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Any of these
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market prices of the Notes. They may
also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the
absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
See “Plan of Distribution.”

This offering circular contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents, but
reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All of those summaries are qualified in their
entirety by this reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective investors
upon request to the Issuer or the initial purchasers.

By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the
accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering circular, (2) you have not relied on the
initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the
accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering circular relates to an offering that is
exempt from registration under the Securities Act and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to
make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering circular, other than as
contained in this offering circular.

This offering circular may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part and it may only be distributed
and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided. You may not disclose any of the contents of this
offering circular or use any information herein for any purpose other than considering the purchase of the Notes.

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering circular.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about           , 2024, which will
be the          business day following the date of this offering circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+


-----

”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of
the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+ , to specify an
alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes
who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors.

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering circular, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed
by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the Notes or the guarantees and we have no present
intention to offer to exchange the Notes and the guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities
Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

statements. These forward-looking statements represent our current intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and
beliefs about future events, including the completion of this offering, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors. It is important to note that our goals and expectations are not predictions of actual performance. We may not

“potential,” “strategy,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “estimate,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in

initiatives, our expansion of cloud-based solutions (as opposed to traditional on-premise delivery of our products)
and our efforts to transition our customers from on-premise to the cloud, including the pace of the transition, our

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Cloud Software prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”).

When presenting Cloud Software’s financial information, this offering circular presents the historical
consolidated financial and other data of Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc. (“CSG Holdings”), a Delaware
corporation that is the sole shareholder of Cloud Software. CSG Holdings has no significant assets or operations
other than the ownership of Cloud Software. CSG Holdings is owned by Holdco, a Delaware corporation. The
common stock of Holdco is owned by certain affiliates of the Investors, and the series A preferred equity, par value
$0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), issued by Holdco pursuant to the Certificate of Designation dated
September 30, 2022 (as amended, the “Certificate of Designation”), is held by certain other investors. CSG Holdings
(i) has no liabilities other than those incidental to its ownership of the equity interests in Cloud Software, and (ii) has
no assets other than its ownership of all of the equity interests of Cloud Software. As a result, there are no material
differences between the historical financial data of CSG Holdings and the historical financial data relating to Cloud
Software.

Prior to the Merger, a new organization structure was implemented. Balboa Intermediate Holdings LLC
(“Intermediate Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company, was the sole shareholder of Cloud Software and
previous reporting entity for the group. Intermediate Holdings had no significant assets or operations other than the
ownership of Cloud Software. Intermediate Holdings was owned by Balboa Holdings LP (“Balboa Holdings”), a
Delaware limited partnership that was owned by certain affiliates of Vista. Intermediate Holdings (i) had no
liabilities other than those incidental to its ownership of the equity interests in Cloud Software, and (ii) had no assets
other than its ownership of all of the equity interests of Cloud Software. Intermediate Holdings distributed its shares
of Cloud Software to Balboa Holdings.

On January 28, 2022, Holdco and CSG Holdings were formed under Balboa Holdings. Cloud Software
contemporaneously formed Picard Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”). Parent then formed Merger Sub,
a Delaware corporation. The aforementioned entities were formed for the sole purpose of consummating the Merger.

The Merger was consummated on September 30, 2022, with CSG Holdings becoming the sole shareholder
of Cloud Software and its subsidiaries, which include Parent, the sole shareholder of Citrix. As a result of the
reorganization, CSG Holdings became the successor reporting entity from Intermediate Holdings. References in this
offering circular to Cloud Software’s historical consolidated financial statements and related notes refer to the
historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Intermediate Holdings prior to the Merger and CSG
Holdings following the Merger.

November 30, 2022 and “fiscal 2021” means Cloud Software’s fiscal year ended November 30, 2021. For purposes

**PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Cloud Software does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings, or other
results. However, the management of Cloud Software has included Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted
EBITDA Margin in this offering circular for illustrative purposes, to present estimated run-rate cost savings,
inclusive of cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, research and development, customer success and operations,
general and administrative and incremental savings, based on actions taken or expected to be taken. Additionally,
other amounts and metrics included in this offering circular incorporate Further Adjusted EBITDA, including
Adjusted Free Cash Flow, first lien leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further
Adjusted EBITDA Margin, in addition to the aforementioned other metrics that utilize Further Adjusted EBITDA,
were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial
information or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, but, in the view of the management of
Cloud Software, were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments,
and present, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and expected future
financial performance. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and readers of this offering circular are cautioned not to place undue reliance on


-----

estimates of Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Neither Cloud Software’s
independent auditors nor any other independent accountants have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures
with respect to the prospective financial information (being the estimated run-rate cost savings included in Further
Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin information contained herein), nor have they expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility
for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

The assumptions and estimates underlying the Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
Margin figures are inherently uncertain and, though considered reasonable by the management of Cloud Software as
of the date of preparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual cost savings to differ materially from the estimated run-rate cost savings
included in Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including, among others, risks and
uncertainties discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this
offering circular. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted
EBITDA Margin are indicative of the future performance of the combined company or that actual results will not
differ materially from the estimates included in Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
The inclusion of Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be regarded as a
representation by any person that the results contained in Further Adjusted EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA
Margin will be achieved. Cloud Software does not generally publish business plans and strategies or make external
disclosures of its anticipated financial position or results of operations. Accordingly, the combined company does
not intend to update or otherwise revise Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, except as required by
law.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information appearing elsewhere in this offering circular. Because it is a_
_summary, it does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You_
_should read this entire offering circular carefully, including the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial_
_Information,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” and the consolidated financial statements of Cloud Software and the notes thereto included elsewhere_
_in this offering circular._

**Overview**

Cloud Software was created in September 2022 by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading
global enterprise-focused software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of companies under the
management of Cloud Software, which we believe positions us to become one of the world’s leading software
providers capable of providing comprehensive, secure and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and
data management. Our collective capabilities help our customers advance their hybrid cloud information technology
(“IT”) strategies and meet the needs of the modern enterprise. The combination of Citrix’s and TIBCO’s product
portfolios allows us to offer solutions to address organizations’ most complex use-cases, serve as a centralized
vendor for senior IT buyers within large enterprises and leverage an array of go-to-market (“GTM”) capabilities for
our buyer and customer bases. Since the combination, we have realized significant operational improvements and
expect to pursue additional opportunities in the near-term to drive further cost savings and long-term operating
efficiencies. We believe that our management team’s track record of identifying, executing and integrating
acquisitions positions Cloud Software to capitalize on further enterprise software market consolidation.

We serve large and mission-critical software markets. Based on our estimates, our total addressable market
(“TAM”) was approximately $70 billion as of 2023 with an expected compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of
15% from 2023 to 2027.

We currently serve over 145,000 active customers in over 150 countries, covering 84% of the Fortune 500,
including over 650 customers who had more than $1 million in ARR as of February 28, 2024. Our highly tenured
customer base includes some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world and span major industry
verticals, including healthcare, financial services, technology, transportation, energy, manufacturing,
telecommunications, business services, consumer and government agencies and others. Notable customers include
Airbus, Bayer, Biogen, Centene, conEdison, Deloitte, eBay, Goya, JetBlue, Pepsi and Siemens. For the twelve
months ended February 28, 2024, we had a Net Retention Rate (“NRR”) of 105% and a Gross Retention Rate
(“GRR”) of 88% for our core platform brands, Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO (including ibi). Our NRR for customers
in our Cloud Software Enterprise segment, who contributed 45% of our ARR, was 116% for the same period.

The size and scale of our business forms one of the world’s foremost enterprise software providers that can
efficiently serve and expand offerings to existing customers. With a larger market footprint following the
combination, we believe Cloud Software has greater strategic importance with customers, increased ability to unlock
growth opportunities within existing TAMs and stronger positioning to maintain its long-term leadership in existing
and new markets.

For the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, we generated $4,787 million of revenue, 96% of which
was from subscription and maintenance revenue, and $670 million of net loss. In addition, we had $3,082 million of
Further Adjusted EBITDA, with a Further Adjusted EBITDA margin of 65%. As of February 28, 2024, we had ARR
of $4,422 million, compared to $4,147 million of ARR as of February 28, 2023, representing over 6% growth. This
includes approximately $3,800 million in Subscription ARR, growing 35%. For further information, see “Summary
Historical Financial Information” and “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”

**Operating Strategy**

Cloud Software’s mission is to create long-term value for all stakeholders by delivering mission-critical
solutions via a subscription-based revenue model. We intend to continue driving industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA


-----

and Adjusted EBITDA margins through improved cost structures and efficiencies and leveraging cash flow to invest
in innovation organically and through acquisitions.

Since TIBCO’s acquisition by Vista in 2014 and the Merger in 2022, we have undergone significant
product and financial transformation. From a product perspective, we have invested in modern cloud platforms that
can offer enhanced simplicity, user experiences and optimized cost of ownership. In addition, we have transitioned
our customers from perpetual licenses to subscription contracts at an accelerated pace where 86% of our ARR is
now subscription-based compared to 68% same time last year, which has resulted in increased revenue predictability
and higher lifetime value from customers. We typically benefit from expansion in average spend when customers
migrate from license to subscription contracts, and believe the ongoing transition will continue to drive growth.

Led by CEO Tom Krause, our strategy is to focus on high-quality, sustainable ARR while driving industry
leading EBITDA. We achieve those results by:

      - maintaining a rigorous and disciplined approach to investment;

      - critical examination of our products to determine core value propositions;

      - investment to deliver highly innovative and competitive solutions to our customers;

      - a focus on renewals and expansion within our existing customer base;

      - divestiture of assets that are not conducive to long-term favorable results in our model; and

      - highly efficient and scalable corporate functions that support our businesses.

We build or buy technology to enhance our businesses’ core products. We anticipate acquiring additional
businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to customers and are good fits to operate
within our model.

Our Further Adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded from approximately 49% for the twelve months
ended February 28, 2023 to approximately 65% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, due to increased
focus on subscription-based revenue streams and greater cost structure focus.

Prior to the end of calendar year 2022, we completed an exhaustive strategic review that included scrutiny
on headcount and program expense, existing product viability and future product and feature opportunities,
engineering strengths and weaknesses, compensation programs, sales motions, GTM strategies, marketing strategies
and customer profiles. As a result of this strategic review, we now go to market under seven portfolio Company
brands: Citrix, NetScaler (as a brand of Citrix), TIBCO, ibi (as a brand of TIBCO), ShareFile, NetScaler
eCommerce, Spotfire, Jaspersoft, and XenServer.

We have coalesced our strategy around these brands to:

       - allow focus by those brands on core value propositions with increased innovation investment;

       - create significant cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies;

       - drive accountability in each business; and

       - leverage increased cash flow to allow debt repayment and future acquisitions.

Our core platform brands are Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO (including ibi). These three brands collectively
generated $4,003 million of ARR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, representing 90.5% of our total


-----

ARR for that period. These core platforms had a Net Retention Rate (“NRR”) of 105% and a Gross Retention Rate
(“GRR”) of 88% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024.

**Portfolio of Brands**

**_Citrix_**

Citrix is a leading provider of infrastructure for secure hybrid work through virtual desktop infrastructure
(“VDI”) and desktop-as-a-service (“DaaS”) with global software development teams and core technologies that
represent a differentiated solution for customers. According to IDC, Citrix is a leader in the Virtual Client
Computing (“VCC”) market.[(1)] Citrix customers include some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world
and span major industry verticals, including healthcare, financial services, technology, manufacturing, consumer and
government agencies. Citrix has long-standing relationships with its customers with an average 10 years of tenure.

Citrix supports today’s remote and hybrid work environment with a broad range of features and
functionalities that tie together the myriad of applications that reside within enterprises. Citrix provides secure
access to employees, helps minimize distractions and improves focus, enabling them to do their best work, elevating
employee productivity and employee engagement, and improving an enterprise’s security profile. Further, Citrix
delivers a unified and secure offering with single sign-on access to all the applications and content employees use in
one unified platform. For administrators, Citrix enables proactive management of security threats in complex,
distributed, hybrid, multi-cloud and multi-device environments, and it empowers administrators to deliver
applications to end users more securely than operating them natively.

Citrix, through its brand NetScaler, has a long history as the application delivery controller of choice for
Fortune 500 companies who rely on it for both employee-facing and customer-facing applications. Today, NetScaler
is a line of networking technology, which includes application delivery, applications insights, and application security

- to help enterprises efficiently consolidate their application delivery and security infrastructure.

In March 2024, Citrix announced a new platform subscription contract program and evolved its universal
subscription contracts. The new subscription contract programs bring the suite of Citrix capabilities, including VDI,
DaaS, Application Delivery Control (“ADC”), Zero Trust, Observability and others, together in a single subscription
contract. For customers, these changes:

  - consolidate and optimize costs;

  - protect business-critical applications and data;

  - reduce operational complexity; and

  - improve user experience.

Effectively, the unified subscription contract model gives customers entitlements to all capabilities,
delivering greater value. For Citrix, the new subscription contract programs simplify our sale process by
consolidating the suite of capabilities into a single subscription contract, and our back-end operations by reducing
the number of SKUs we manage.

Citrix goes to market directly and through partners, depending on customer ARR. Our largest customers
have assigned account executives and often receive support from large systems integrators partnered with Citrix.
Customers below a certain ARR level are serviced by resellers and distributors.  Sales to all their customer tiers are
outsourced to partners in the three following regions: Latin America (excluding Brazil), the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) and emerging markets (Middle East and Africa).

Meaningful Citrix competitors include certain offerings from Omnissa (formerly operating as VMware’s
End-User Computing Division), Microsoft, AWS and Google.

_Technology Relationships_


-----

Citrix’s most important technology relationship is with Microsoft, a relationship that has for over 30 years
spanned product development, GTM initiatives and channel partner development. This has provided mutual customers
secure, high-performance delivery of applications, desktops and data to their employees. In April 2024, Citrix and
Microsoft extended their strategic partnership for an additional eight years. The renewed strategic partnership includes
a focus on the development of new cloud and AI solutions with an integrated Citrix / Microsoft product roadmap,
allowing Citrix the opportunity to enhance the value of Citrix software as well as contribute to Microsoft AVD.
Specifically, Citrix will be the preferred Microsoft Global Azure Partner solution for Enterprise Desktop-as-a-Service
when collaborating with joint Azure customers.

**_TIBCO_**

TIBCO is a global leader in enterprise data management, with an integrated business intelligence and
analytics platform that utilizes high-end enterprise application integration and master data management (“MDM”).
TIBCO provides critical data integration components in a company’s operating infrastructure, covering a variety of
durable industry verticals. Further, TIBCO offers a control plane that provides observation across all data planes,
including on-premises, management of deployments and scaling, and monitoring of runtime performance metrics.

TIBCO offers the high performance, throughput, reliability, and scalability demanded by mission critical
operations. Like Citrix, TIBCO recently enhanced its subscription model by offering a new platform subscription
contract. The platform subscription contract provides the additional value of:

  - gaining visibility over all TIBCO solutions wherever they exist within the customer environment;

  - accelerating development of new, innovative applications and digital services;

  - dramatically reducing time to identify runtime and performance problems;

  - easy deployment and scaling of TIBCO solutions to cloud platforms of choice; and

  - measuring and optimizing the costs and business value of TIBCO solutions.

ibi is a brand of TIBCO and provides scalable data and analytics software that makes data easy to access
and analytics easy to consume. It is a business intelligence and full stack data management solution providing
business-ready data. ibi, previously known as Information Builders, was acquired by TIBCO in 2021.

Meaningful TIBCO competitors include certain offerings from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and against pure play
companies in select areas, including MuleSoft and Boomi (integration), Denoda and Informatica (data management),
Qlik, Tableau and SAS (analytics).

**_NetScaler_**

NetScaler has a long history as the application delivery controller of choice for Fortune 500 companies who
rely on it for both employee-facing and customer-facing applications. Today, NetScaler, is a line of networking
technology, which includes application delivery, applications insights, and application security - to help enterprises
efficiently consolidate their application delivery and security infrastructure. Following the strategic review and
change in GTM strategy, many of the products previously offered under the Citrix App Delivery & Security product
line now go to market within the NetScaler product line.

Capabilities offered as part of the platform include:

  - ADC - provides high levels of application availability, choice and flexibility to meet diverse application
deployment needs, including a single code base for operational consistency wherever your application is
deployed — on-premises, hosted or in any cloud — and affords easy migration between environments;


-----

  - Application insights - provides actionable insight to aid performance, troubleshooting and capacity
planning; provides transaction telemetry in multiple formats (Appflow, Logstream, IPFIX) to any other
third-party or homegrown tool for subsequent analysis;

  - Application security - provides single-pass architecture for security combined with a line-rate web
application firewall (“WAF”) performance. As a consolidated application delivery and security platform,
NetScaler delivers comprehensive protection with WAF, bot management, and API security across all types
of application architectures and deployment scenarios.

Meaningful competition to NetScaler includes product offerings from F5, Radware, A10 and Cisco. In
addition, for certain cloud and software centric use cases, large cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure
can provide customers with ADC solutions built into their public cloud.

**_Other_**

Other notable brands under Cloud Software include:

**_ShareFile_**     - ShareFile is a secure content collaboration, file sharing and sync software that supports all the
document-centric tasks and workflow needs of small to large businesses, including electronic signature. ShareFile
also offers cloud-based or on-premises storage, virtual data rooms and client portals.

**_NetScaler e-Commerce – NetScaler e-Commerce leverages NetScaler’s original purpose of providing load_**
balancing and ensuring website performance and availability. It is focused on customers with e-commerce websites,
such as online retail and marketplaces, digital products and services, SaaS, IaaS, online gaming and gambling. This
is in contrast to the NetScaler capabilities within Citrix, which are focused on enterprise application delivery,
security and observability.

**_Spotfire – Spotfire offers a single visual analytics platform for data exploration and real-time decisions._**
Backed by point-and-click, no-code data science, Spotfire empowers non-technical personnel to analyze both data-atrest and data-in-motion, together, for faster insight.

**_Jaspersoft - Jaspersoft provides timely, actionable data inside of applications and business processes through_**
an embeddable, cost-effective reporting and analytics platform.

**_XenServer - XenServer is an industry leading platform for cost-effective desktop, server, and cloud_**
virtualization infrastructures. XenServer enables organizations of any size or type to consolidate and transform
compute resources into virtual workloads for today’s data center requirements.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Mission-critical, enterprise-focused software platform driving strong retention rates_**

Market dynamics have accelerated demand for new workplace models, prompting organizations to
prioritize digital transformation and embrace secure hybrid work. We enable today’s remote and hybrid work
environment with single sign-on access to all the applications and content employees use in a unified platform
through our market-leading virtual desktop infrastructure (“VDI”) and DaaS capabilities. App Delivery & Security
solutions further optimize performance with enhanced security, reliability and user experience.

We deliver a portfolio of enterprise data solutions and are a leader in application integration, data
management and analytics. Customers can connect any application, device or data source to ensure real time data
flows across systems to automate critical decisions. The suite of data management capabilities ensures business
operations are accessing consistent and accurate data in a single domain. Our analytics capabilities empower
customers to analyze structured, unstructured and streaming data to identify insights with real-time analytics and
enable data-informed decisions. Products often become the basis for new systems and expansion, which drives
continued and incremental usage.


-----

By deploying a streamlined set of solutions, our customers are able to enable digitization across access
management, desktop access and application integration. Our software solutions are mission critical and deeply
embedded within the IT infrastructure, which creates high switching costs given the disruptive, time-consuming and
resource-intensive nature of new enterprise software installations. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2024,
we had an NRR of 105% and GRR of 88% for our core platform brands, Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO (including
ibi), demonstrating our well-received product suite with customers.

**_Industry leader in large and growing markets_**

We believe we are well positioned within the approximately $70 billion TAM across our existing products
as of 2023 and will continue to be a leader in developing innovative technology solutions for our large base of
enterprise customers. Based on our estimates, our TAM is expected to grow at a 15% CAGR from 2023 to 2027.

**_Diversified, global blue-chip customer base_**

We have a longstanding, durable customer base, serving leaders across a variety of industry verticals. We
believe our current scale makes us one of the world’s largest enterprise software providers, serving more than
145,000 active customers in over 150 countries. In addition, we currently serve approximately 84% of the Fortune
500, demonstrating the blue-chip nature of our clients.

Senior, IT-focused executives are usually the buyers of our solutions. With strong customer relationships
and a track record of landing and expanding within customers, we believe we are well positioned to capture
additional sales opportunities among enterprise customers. For example, on a standalone basis, the legacy Citrix
business had identified additional penetration opportunities with approximately 70% of its existing customers and
the legacy TIBCO business had identified additional penetration opportunities with 91% of its existing customers.
Since the completion of the Merger in September 2022, we began to successfully leverage new cross-sell
opportunities among both sets of customer bases within their existing product suites.

Our products are deployed across a broad range of industry verticals including financial services,
governmental agencies, transportation, media, telecommunication companies, manufacturers, educational
institutions, retailers, distributors, hospitals and others. Our strong presence in numerous industry verticals and the
mission-critical nature of our products helps to diversify and mitigate the risk of industry-specific and cyclical
downturns.

In addition, we maintain a balanced geographic revenue base, with a broad global footprint. For the twelve
months ended February 28, 2024, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue in the Americas, 33% in EMEA
and 7% in APAC.

**_Highly recurring model with significant ARR growth_**


-----

-----

have extensive experience acquiring and integrating businesses and are strategically aligned with our management in
their views on the integration.

**Business Strategy**

We will continue to build on our market-leading position to achieve sustained long-term growth in
revenue and profitability through leveraging our strengths described below. Key components of the strategy that we
intend to pursue include:

  - **_Leverage position as market-leading end-to-end solution provider – We focus on profitably leveraging_**
our expansive portfolio, large customer base and market-leading position to maintain sustained long-term
growth:

    - **_Increased strategic value creation for customers – We believe that we bring greater strategic_**
importance to customers since the formation of Cloud Software. By combining leading vendors for
mission-critical solutions through the Merger, we believe we have become a global leader in secure
application delivery and integration solutions for enterprises, acting as a one-stop shop that simplifies
purchasing of multiple solutions through our broad product portfolio.

    - **_Broad complementary product portfolio – We offer an expanded portfolio of complementary product_**
offerings to customers. Our expansive product set, including VCC software, App Delivery & Security
solutions, content management and collaboration solutions, analytics and business intelligence
(“ABI”), data science and ML, and MDM solutions, helps meet the diverse needs of customers across
different market segments. Since the formation of Cloud Software, we have also begun to successfully
improve our penetration within existing customers by leveraging the broader product set of our core
platform brands.

    - **_New transformative solutions – We are developing new transformative products and solutions for_**
customers. We have started to build on some of the best technologies and products from our portfolio,
leveraging our expertise of our best-in-class engineers and product experts. We are heavily focused on
efficiently developing innovative new offerings that leverage capabilities across both portfolios and
deliver incremental value to customers.

    - **_Deeper understanding of customer needs and market trends – We leverage our deep understanding of_**
customer needs and market trends to focus innovation efforts on the most value-enhancing areas,
benefitting from our broad portfolio to align innovation efforts with industry growth drivers. We
currently serve over 145,000 active customers in over 150 countries, providing expansive relationships
and insight into customer needs. We are a leader in both work solutions and in application integration,
data management, business intelligence and analytics and our leadership team provides extensive
insight into market trends.

  - **_Continuing transition towards recurring revenue and subscription models – We are focused on further_**
strengthening our recurring business model, including transitioning customers to subscription contracts.
Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Mix, which represents the percentage of Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue,
divided by Non-GAAP Revenue, was 96% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, increasing
from 92% for fiscal 2022. The Citrix business unit, which contributed approximately 72% of ARR for the
twelve months ended February 28, 2024, has over 50 million users, with 80% of those being subscription
contract users, compared to 50% for the previous twelve months. Our SaaS contracts are generally sold as
three-year subscriptions. With a 105% NRR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, we believe we
are well-positioned to benefit from increased lifetime value. We will deliver our products via subscription.
To that end, we have changed our licensing options for Citrix and NetScaler. For TIBCO, the evolution to a
subscription model is a continuation of a process that had already begun. The changes to both Citrix and
NetScaler offerings greatly simplify the licensing process, allowing customers to buy one subscription
contract for Citrix and/or one subscription contract for NetScaler and accommodate all the variations,
namely: “hybrid deployment,” “cloud deployment,” and “on premise.” On March 8, 2023, we announced


-----

our new “Citrix Universal Subscription,” which replaces our former “DaaS + Hybrid Rights” offering.
Importantly, this new subscription contract program has no restrictions on how a customer can deploy
Citrix or where they host their workloads. Further, under the new subscription contract program, we no
longer offer the sale of a longtime perpetual software maintenance service. However, existing and active
maintenance contracts will be honored until their relevant expiration dates. With “Citrix Universal
Subscription,” customers have the freedom to use Citrix Virtual Application and Desktop management
infrastructure on-premises, deploy the infrastructure on a public cloud of their choice, and/or leverage our
Citrix cloud services control plane in any combination. We believe this flexibility is unmatched in the
industry and well suited for this era of hybrid, distributed workforces. “Citrix Universal Subscription”
delivers the greatest flexibility, our most feature-rich solution, and best support experience. Also on March
8, 2023, NetScaler launched a new and simplified program for NetScaler ADC called “NetScaler
Subscription.” This subscription subscription contract model: (i) simplifies packaging to reduce confusion
and minimize purchase friction; (ii) aligns NetScaler ADC hardware and software pricing for consistency
and price parity; (iii) gives predictable annual operational expenses; and (iv) reduces barriers to entry by
eliminating minimum order quantities for software pools and removing need for NetScaler ADM as a
licensing server. As part of this announcement, we ended the sale of all perpetually licensed NetScaler
ADC MPX/SDX hardware and VPX/BLX software. The end of perpetual licensing does not indicate the
discontinuation of product and/or support for existing customers. All existing active maintenance contracts
will be honored until their relevant expiration dates.

  - **_Focusing on cost savings targets and prioritizing operating efficiency – We place a rigorous focus on_**
operational efficiency to create meaningful value. We also continue to place a strong focus on achieving the
near-term cost savings targets and on prioritizing operating efficiency over the long-term to drive
meaningful value creation. These initiatives are being executed by a dedicated implementation team led by
management along with sponsor operational executives and third-party resources with extensive experience
integrating businesses. To the extent that we pursue further acquisitions, we believe our focus on operating
efficiency and deep experience integrating acquisitions will be a key value driver.

**Industry Overview**

  - **_Virtualization (VDI & DaaS) – Virtualization allows enterprises to manage large numbers of desktops in a_**
virtualized server environment allowing companies to better utilize servers based on demand and usage. All
the data resides in servers in either on-premises data centers or in the cloud. VDI is the hosting of desktop
environments on a central server. DaaS solutions provide a virtualized desktop or Windows application
experience to workers, entirely from a remote hosted location such as the public cloud. DaaS eliminates the
need for businesses to purchase the physical infrastructure associated with VDI or server-based computing,
instead functioning through subscription- and usage-based payment structures.

According to our estimates based on Gartner research, worldwide end user spending for the Virtualization
Infrastructure Software market is $9.1 billion as of 2023, growing at a 2023 - 2027 CAGR of 7% to $11.7
billion.[(2)] Other key players in the VCC market include AWS, Microsoft Azure and Omnissa (formerly
operating as VMware’s End-User Computing division)

  - **_App Delivery & Security – Application delivery, which includes ADCs, primarily provides security and_**
access to applications at peak times. As computing is moving toward the cloud, software ADCs have been
performing tasks that have been traditionally performed by custom-built hardware. ADCs also offer
additional functionalities and flexibility for application deployment. These solutions help organizations
quickly and securely scale up their application services based on the demand in the cloud. Traditional
ADCs have been used for load balancing application servers in order to manage traffic and application
deployment. However, next generation ADCs offer new functions that include security socket layer
offloading, visibility, multi-cloud support, application analytics, transmission control protocol
optimizations, rate shaping and web application firewalls. ADCs can be used by almost any organization
that utilizes large-scale content delivery networks in order to provide fast web application (software)
services and ensure high-traffic websites are secure and available to their users. They are also being used as
a reverse proxy server that is placed in between web servers and the internet, removing the load from their
origin servers and ensuring high availability for a seamless end-user experience.


-----

Application security encompasses measures taken to improve the security of an application often by
finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities. Application security systems reduce the security
risks involved in the different operations of various applications, such as web and mobile applications.

Key competitors in the application delivery and security market include A10 Networks, F5 Networks and
Radware.

- **_Integration_** **_– Nearly all business processes (e.g., procurement, asset management and customer_**
relationship management) are evolving in such a way that application leaders increasingly must integrate
diverse applications, data, events, devices and people, both within and outside of their organization. Data
integration tools include tools for change data capture, extraction, transformation and loading (“ETL”), and
data virtualization. Application integration tools includes tools for data consistency/synchronization,
message validation, mapping, transformation, and orchestration. The primary goal for such tools is to allow
data structures and applications that were designed independently to work well together. Such tools
originally focused on targeted styles, such as ETL, data federation/virtualization and data
replication/synchronization, but now also include message-based delivery models. Enterprise integration
platform-as-a-service (“EiPaaS”) is a combination of integration technology functionalities that are
delivered as a suite of cloud services and designed to support enterprise-class integration initiatives. An
EiPaaS provider offers high availability, disaster recovery, security, service level agreements (“SLAs”) and
technical support. It also enables users to develop and execute multiple integration scenarios by providing
support for multiple personas. EiPaaS provides many of the capabilities addressed by enterprise service
buses and other data integration tools, with an emphasis on addressing cloud services integration use cases,
overall ease of use and SaaS-like delivery. It is used for a combination of data, multistep process and
composite services integration and typically includes API management capabilities.

Our Cloud Integration product, for example, provides functionality for integrating applications, data, APIs,
business-to-business and internet of things, and automating processes.

According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide iPaaS and data integration software end user spending
was $13.0 billion, and is expected to reach $25.0 billion by 2027, representing a CAGR of 18%.[(2)] Other
key players include Boomi, Informatica, Microsoft, MuleSoft, Oracle, SAP and Workato.

- **_Data Management – Businesses are continuing to seek the agility afforded by a single, trusted, enterprise-_**
wide view of master data and have turned to MDM solutions to help achieve digital acceleration goals.
MDM is a technology-enabled business discipline in which business and IT work together to ensure the
uniformity, accuracy, stewardship, governance, semantic consistency and accountability of an enterprise’s
official shared master data assets. MDM solutions are enterprise software products that support the global
identification, linking and synchronization of master data across heterogeneous data sources through
reconciliation; create and manage a central, consistent system or index of record for master data; support
common MDM hub implementation styles; enable generation and delivery of a trusted version of one or
more data domains to all stakeholders, in support of various business initiatives; support ongoing master
data stewardship and governance requirements through workflow-based monitoring and corrective-action
techniques; are agnostic to the business application landscape in which they reside – that is, they do not
assume or depend on the presence of any particular business application (or applications) to function
because they are application neutral; and can be implemented by end-user organizations without having to
make use of required professional services (i.e., not optional).

According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide MDM software end user spending reached $1.6 billion
and is expected to reach $2.0 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 6%.[(2)] Other key players include
Ataccama, IBM, Informatica, Profisee, Reltio, Riversand, SAP, Semarchy and Stibo Systems.

- **_Collaboration Solutions_** **–** Work solutions refer to business applications that foster more efficient work
execution and collaboration across document, signature, functional and project-based workflows. As work
becomes increasingly distributed, work solutions provide highly flexible digital channels and optimization
tools to enable an intelligent digital interface which offers an integrated user experience augmented by


-----

cognitive technologies such as AI, ML and advanced analytics. Work solutions provide a secure,
personalized and federated view of the resources that workers require to do their jobs, including
collaborators as well as applications and data, from anywhere.

ShareFile provides a secure and complete platform for worker productivity and collaboration across all
work scenarios. Our offerings are differentiated in that their content collaboration solutions are optimized
to run in VDI & DaaS environments. Our work solutions capabilities include collaborative work
management, content collaboration, workflows and automation, and e-signature.

According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide Content Services end user spending reached $16.0
billion and is expected to reach $25.8 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 13%.[(3)] Other key players
include Box, Dropbox, Google Cloud and Microsoft 365.

  - **_Data Analytics and Insights – ABI platforms are characterized by easy-to-use functionality that supports a_**
full analytic workflow – from data preparation to visual exploration and insight generation – with an
emphasis on self-service usage and augmented user assistance. ABI platforms are no longer differentiated
by their data visualization capabilities, which are now commoditized. Differentiation has shifted to how
well platforms support augmented analytics. Augmentation utilizes ML and AI-assisted data preparation,
insight generation and insight explanation to help business people and data analysts explore and analyze
data more effectively than they could manually. Rather than being a discrete capability, augmentation is
now threaded through platforms as ML is applied across the data-to-decision workflow. ABI platform
functionality includes cloud analytics, data source connectivity, data preparation, cataloging, automated
insights, data visualization, data storytelling, natural language query, natural language generation,
reporting, security and manageability.

Vendors in the ABI market range from startups backed by venture capital funds to large technology firms.
The vast majority of new spending in this market is on cloud deployments. Although spending on ABI is
growing more slowly than in the 2010s, the number of people using ABI platforms is accelerating.

According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide Enterprise Software Analytics* end user spending
reached $31.7 billion and is expected to reach $60.8 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 18%.[(3)] Other
key players include Microsoft, Oracle, Qlik, SAP, SAS, Tableau and ThoughtSpot

The markets in which we operate benefit from a number of industry trends that are driving their growth and
enhancing their strategic importance for customers:

  - **_Global Shift to Secure Hybrid Work_** **– Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid increase in**
remote and hybrid work, as well as the need for business continuity, has made desktop virtualization and
DaaS a major priority for organizations. Remote and hybrid strategies continue to pressure digital
workplace infrastructure & operations (“I&O”) leaders to measure and improve employee productivity and
experience.

  - **_Transition to Cloud – The pandemic strained on-premises digital workplace solutions and accelerated the_**
shift to low-touch, cloud-hosted, and internet-facing technology and services. Most I&O leaders are
accelerating their investments in cloud-powered workplace technologies to deliver services to workers in
any location. Agile and easy to integrate cloud solutions are essential to all types of organizations in order
to reduce costs, increase flexibility, streamline operations and automate redundant processes.

  - **_End-User Security – Customers increasingly require solutions that help them securely and efficiently_**

transformation to upgrade their network architectures, networking and security solutions have been
essential. With the rise in internet traffic, business applications and the huge number of internet-enabled


-----

devices, ADCs provide the front-end intelligence that supplements and enhances business applications
flow. With organizations increasingly connecting to various business-critical applications via the internet,
the risk of a potential breach has been continuously increasing.

  - **_Enterprise Integration Platform-as-a-Service – To help facilitate digital transformation, EiPaaS is one of_**
the essential tools that organizations are using to deliver hyperautomation. Organizations are adopting
EiPaaS to respond to drastic business changes, such as integration initiatives, contain costs and increase
flexibility. As more organizations adopt cloud and SaaS applications to simplify their operations, vendormanaged solutions are becoming more appealing to buyers.

  - **_Proliferation of Data_** **– The proliferation of data, and the need for integrated insights spanning**
organizations, systems, and applications, necessitates I&O teams to expand IT spend further into work
environments that are increasingly distributed. As businesses seek support for “360-degree view”
requirements, products like MDM and ABI platforms are positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on
business outcomes.

  - **_Proliferation of Applications – As organizations increase the number of applications deployed in their_**
overall application infrastructure, integration becomes essential to support business agility. In order to
quickly meet diverse business needs, organizations need to rapidly integrate new applications with the rest
of their application portfolio which requires comprehensive API management and integration suites.

  - **_Need for Efficiency – As companies look to accelerate their digital strategies, the achievement of time, cost_**
and other operational efficiencies are paramount to gaining competitive advantages from an investment in a
digital transformation. By streamlining digital processes, IT vendors and managed solutions, businesses are
optimizing their operations to improve workplace productivity and reduce processing times.

  - **_Increasingly Digitized and Interconnected World – As the global economy becomes increasingly digital_**
and interconnected, organizations are moving toward more collaborative and efficient work environments
across divisions and locations. Maintaining engagement and productivity around the globe requires I&O
leaders to ensure their organizations and workstreams are streamlined and synchronized.

**Summary Historical Financial Information**

The following tables set forth our summary historical financial information for the periods and as of the
dates indicated.

The following historical financial information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with
the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included
elsewhere in this offering circular and Cloud Software’s historical consolidated financial statements and the related
notes included elsewhere in this offering circular, as well as information included in the sections “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Capitalization” included elsewhere in this offering
circular.

Cloud Software has derived the consolidated statements of operations data and the consolidated statements
of cash flows data for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated balance sheets
data as of November 30, 2023 and 2022 from Cloud Software’s audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering circular. Cloud Software has derived the consolidated statements of operations data and
the consolidated statements of cash flows data for the three months ended February 28, 2024 and 2023 and the
consolidated balance sheet data as of February 28, 2024 from Cloud Software’s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular, which reflect all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments unless otherwise indicated) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Cloud Software’s historical results are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Cloud Software’s historical consolidated financial
statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended February 28,
2024, which does not comply with GAAP but we believe provides investors with useful information to assess our
performance, has been derived by subtracting the line item for the three months ended February 28, 2023 from the
line item for the twelve months ended November 30, 2023 and adding the line item for the three months ended
February 28, 2024.

(1) Cloud Software believes that in addition to the results determined in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,

Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are
useful in evaluating Cloud Software’s business, results of operations and financial condition. These measures differ from
GAAP in that they exclude certain items, such as amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, interest
expense, net income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other expenses,
restructuring adjustments, acquisition-related revenue adjustments, impact of change in accounting principles, non-EBITDA
salaries, benefits and operating expenses, business optimization expenses, foreign exchange loss (gain), management and
directors’ fees and other expenses, estimates of run-rate cost savings actioned or to be actioned in good faith, within a period
of 24 months from the end of the period and annual change in unearned revenue, if positive. If the change in unearned
revenue is negative, then it is recorded as zero. See “Certain Definitions” and the reconciliations below for details of how
each non-GAAP metric is derived. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and
statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.

Cloud Software uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate performance
and to evaluate and compensate executives. Cloud Software has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to
GAAP financial results because Cloud Software believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful
information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by
certain non-cash items or cash charges that are the result of discrete activities that are not used by management when
evaluating Cloud Software’s historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, Cloud Software understands that
some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing operating margins, operating expenses and
net income and comparing Cloud Software’s financial performance to that of Cloud Software’s peer companies and
competitors.

There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies in Cloud
Software’s industry may calculate these measures differently, which may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure.
The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a
substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income) and should
not be considered measures of our liquidity.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below and all of the information contained in this offering circular before deciding whether to purchase_
_any Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also_
_materially and adversely affect our business. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, cash flows, financial_
_condition and results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements_
_and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See_
_“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering circular._

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit_**
**_our ability to react to changes in the economy or our market, expose us to interest rate risk, and prevent us from_**
**_timely satisfying our obligations._**

As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024 Transaction
and this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately $17,550.1 million of total
indebtedness, of which $13,712.5 million (including the Notes offered hereby) is secured by first-priority liens on
the Collateral and of which $3,837.6 million is secured by second-priority liens on the Collateral. In addition, we
had $1,000.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit),
subject to customary conditions. Any borrowings under the Revolving Facility once made, would constitute senior
secured indebtedness secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets, or issue equity to obtain
necessary funds; we do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis or on terms
satisfactory to us or at all.

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

  - making it more difficult for us to make payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the First Lien
Notes, the Second Lien Notes, the Rollover Citrix Notes, the Notes and our other obligations;

  - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and market conditions and to changes in the industries in
which we compete;

  - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, future
working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, future strategic business opportunities, or
other general corporate requirements;

  - restricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

  - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, investments, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;

  - limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage
compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged; and

  - increasing our cost of borrowing.

Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us
to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations may increase even though the amount
borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.


-----

Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments
may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. If we do not
comply with these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying
capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional
equity capital.

The Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture (as defined herein), the Second Lien Notes Indenture
(as defined herein), the indenture governing the Rollover Citrix Notes (the “Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture”) and
the indenture that will govern the Notes contain, or will contain, operating covenants and restrictions that limit our
operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them. These restrictions limit, or will
limit, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

  - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

  - make certain investments, loans and advances;

  - incur certain liens;

  - enter into transactions with affiliates;

  - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;

  - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments
to the Issuer or the guarantors;

  - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

  - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, we and our restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain additional covenants in respect of the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We and our restricted subsidiaries are also subject to certain negative covenants in
respect of the Series A Preferred Stock that impose restrictions on our business, including, among other things,
restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, make certain fundamental changes, pay dividends and make other
payments, repurchases and redemptions in respect of capital stock, make investments, sell assets, change our lines of
business, enter into transactions with affiliates and certain other corporate actions. Such negative covenants are
subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

The restrictions in the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture,
the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture, the indenture that will govern the Notes and the documents governing the
Series A Preferred Stock may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our
business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with
companies that are not subject to similar restrictions. We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that
could subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, that we
will be able to obtain waivers from the applicable lenders and/or amend the applicable covenants.

Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of
operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost
reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general
economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could
result in a default or event of default under the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien
Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture and/or the indenture that will govern the Notes, which, if not
cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced


-----

to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our prospects, business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and could cause
us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in
transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and stockholders.

See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for additional information about the covenants set forth in
the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture and the Rollover Citrix
Notes Indenture and “Description of the Notes” for additional information about the covenants set forth in the
indenture that will govern the Notes.

**_We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows._**

We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled
payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance,
which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative,
regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from
operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and/or interest on our indebtedness.
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek
additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or
refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

If we are at any point unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due, or if any other
event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or
proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or
liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries
may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the Credit
Agreement or other indebtedness or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security
documents would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Despite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt,_**
**_including off-balance sheet financing, contractual obligations, and general and commercial liabilities. This could_**
**_further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including
additional tranches of term loans and/or term loan increases, increases to our revolving commitments and/or
additional revolving credit facilities as well as off-balance sheet financings, contractual obligations, and general and
commercial liabilities. Although the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes
Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture, the indenture that will govern the Notes and the documents
governing the Series A Preferred Stock contain, or will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, such restrictions are, or will be, subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and
any additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions
also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we and our subsidiaries
incur significant additional indebtedness or other obligations, the related risks that we face could increase.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, holders of Notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of Notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.
As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other


-----

obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal or
state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further
subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a
court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the Notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain
circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

**_If the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our Revolving Facility fail to extend credit under our_**
**_facility, our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected._**

We have access to capital through our Revolving Facility, which is governed by the Credit Agreement.
Each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our Revolving Facility is responsible on a several, but
not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our Revolving Facility. If any participant or
group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our Revolving Facility fails to satisfy its or
their respective obligations to extend credit under the Revolving Facility and we are unable to find a replacement for
such participant or participants on a timely basis (if at all), our liquidity may be adversely affected.

**_We utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates_**
**_on our variable rate indebtedness, and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or_**
**_non-performance of these instruments._**

We have entered into interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest
rates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy
will be effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some circumstances.

**_Interest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and cash flows._**

Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bears interest at variable rates. Because we have
substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. We have attempted, and may continue to attempt, to minimize interest rate risk and lower
our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps
and interest rate caps. As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024
Transaction and this offering of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately
$8,600.1 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate indebtedness, representing approximately 49% of our
total debt. See “Note 9 – Debt and Credit Facilities” to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering circular for additional information.

**_We are exposed to additional risks related to variable interest rates._**

U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness under the Term Loan A Facility (as defined below), the USD Term
Loan B Facilities (as defined below) and the Revolving Facility bears interest based on the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”), U.S. Prime Rate, or Federal Funds Rate. Euro denominated indebtedness under the EUR
Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) bears interest based on EURIBOR. Thus, a change in the short-term
interest rate environment (particularly a material change) could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause the market value of our debt securities to
decline.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. Additionally, under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a
change of control may constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings


-----

under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend, and, under the terms of the First Lien
Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture, a change of control will require us to make a change of
control offer with respect to the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, respectively. The source of funds for
any purchase of the Notes, the First Lien Notes or the Second Lien Notes and any repayment of borrowings under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations
or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the
Notes, the First Lien Notes or the Second Lien Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient
financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our
other indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such
purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase
the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes, the First Lien Notes, the
Second Lien Notes or events of default and potential breaches of the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the
indenture that will govern the Notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes,
even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our
capital structure, credit ratings, financial condition or the value of the Notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions which would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the
Notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital
structure or credit ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_Holders of Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the Notes will include a phrase relating
to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the issuer to
purchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any_**
**_related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes and
the incurrence of the guarantees of the Notes and any related security. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable
provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the
guarantees thereof and any related security could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a
guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either
issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or any related security and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following
is also true at the time thereof:

  - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of
the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees;

  - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees left the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable,
with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business;

  - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay as they mature; or

  - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money
damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.


-----

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the
extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the
Notes.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a
guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the
guarantees and any related security would be subordinated to other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would
deem an entity insolvent if:

  - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair
saleable value of all of its assets;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

  - it could not pay its indebtedness as they became due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee and any related
security was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could void the payment
obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or security interest, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee or
security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor or could
require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee or security
interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred,
you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit
guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and
these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event
of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that
indebtedness.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to
other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of
Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other
creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not
inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the Notes_**
**_under applicable securities laws, and there are significant restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the_**
**_Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We are
not required to and do not intend to register the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and we are not required and do not intend to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under
the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty transferring
your Notes, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**_We are not required to file reports with the SEC, and we are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The indenture_**
**_that will govern the Notes will contain periodic reporting requirements that will be different and less burdensome_**


-----

**_than would be applicable to us if we had agreed to register the Notes immediately following the closing of the_**
**_offering._**

We are not required to file reports with the SEC. The indenture that will govern the Notes will require us to
provide annual, quarterly and certain material current reports to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee. The
content of the reports required by the indenture will, however, be more limited than if we were subject to the
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports.” In
addition, we are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires public companies to have and maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have
management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires
public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have
management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent registered
public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We are not required to comply with these
internal control requirements and therefore we may not have comparable controls or procedures in place as
compared to public companies. Further, the financial information we provide to holders of the Notes and the Trustee
may not be comparable to reports filed by public companies.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the Notes._**

We expect the Notes to be eligible for trading by QIBs, as defined under Rule 144A, but we do not intend
to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or include the Notes in any automated quotation system. Certain
initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes, and, if commenced,
they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Even if an active trading market for
the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may
adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your Notes. For these reasons, an
active market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and
liquidity of the Notes. In that case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or
at a favorable price.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes and related guarantees will not apply during_**
**_any period in which the Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes and security interests will not apply to us
during any period in which the Notes are rated investment grade, provided at such time no default or event of default
has occurred and is continuing. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur
indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated
investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings. However,
suspension of these covenants and related guarantees would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not
be permitted while these covenants, guarantees and security interests were in force. To the extent the covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of
default under the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”

**_Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our_**
**_subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only our wholly-owned
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under (or are borrowers under) the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities will initially guarantee the Notes. None of our foreign subsidiaries, non-wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries will initially guarantee the Notes, and no such subsidiaries are expected to
guarantee the Notes in the future. As of and for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, the non-guarantor


-----

subsidiaries generated approximately 42.5% of our consolidated revenues, held approximately 5.7% of our
consolidated assets and had no debt for borrowed money outstanding, in each case after intercompany eliminations.
In addition, the guarantee of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a
transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes or upon certain other events described in
“Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” The indenture that will govern the Notes will permit these non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not
considered indebtedness thereunder.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the guarantees and the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the Notes and any related security will be released
automatically. The guarantee of a guarantor of the Notes and any related security will be automatically released to
the extent such guarantor or security interest is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity
interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes. As a result, the
Collateral securing the Notes may be released automatically to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such
Collateral in transactions not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes, including the sale of any entity
in its entirety that owns or holds such Collateral. The Collateral securing the Notes may also be released
automatically upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee as permitted by the indenture that will govern
the Notes or when such guarantor otherwise ceases to be a guarantor.

The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted
subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such
guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a
refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee,
or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the
secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the Notes will be automatically released as well, in which case
any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the Notes will also be released. If the guarantee of any
guarantor is released, no holder of the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the
indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or
unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the Notes. For a description of
all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee and the Collateral securing the Notes will be
automatically released, see “Description of the Notes—Guarantees,” “Description of the Notes—Security for the
Notes.”

**_Changes in our credit rating or the rating of the Notes could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the_**
**_Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the Notes. A
negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices of the Notes and on our
ability to obtain future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we currently expect that, upon issuance, the Notes will be rated by Standard & Poor’s Investors
Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. A rating agency’s rating of the Notes is not
a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Notes. Such ratings are limited in
scope and do not comment as to material risks relating to an investment in the Notes. An explanation of the
significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings
will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time. Rating agencies also may lower, suspend or withdraw
ratings on the Notes or our other debt in the future. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse against us or any
other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or
withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market prices or marketability of the Notes.


-----

**_The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be_**
**_required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults and amendments taken under the indenture that will govern the Notes by_**
**_beneficial owners, including those with short positions in excess of their interests in the Notes, will be_**
**_disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes (other than screened affiliates) agrees, in connection with
any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer
and such Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment
in the Notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such
holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) have represented to such
holder that they are not) Net Short (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) with respect to the Notes and (ii)
provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to
verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. These restrictions
may impact a holder’s ability to participate in a Noteholder Direction if it is unable to make such a representation.

**_Affiliates of the Investors control us and their interests may conflict with our interests or the interests of the_**
**_holders of the Notes._**

We are an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco. Investment funds affiliated with the Investors
beneficially own substantially all of Holdco’s issued and outstanding capital stock together with the investors in the
Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Investors have the right to designate all of the members of our board of
directors. As a result, the Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have
the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, regardless
of whether the holders of Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the
Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured
indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes. In addition, to the
extent permitted by the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the
Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture, the indenture that will govern the Notes and the documents governing the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Investors may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or otherwise use
our funds for the benefit of our business.

In addition, the Investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. While we do not currently
compete with these investments, the Investors may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business
or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to the current or future operations of these
investments. Also, the Investors may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Investors continue to indirectly own
a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the
Investors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**Risks Related to the Collateral Securing the Notes**

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Collateral, the representative of_**
**_the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control actions_**
**_(including the exercise of remedies) with respect to the Collateral. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**
**_contains customary provisions for New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreements, but does not contain provisions_**


-----

**_that seek to address non-New York (U.S.) law insolvency and restructuring considerations typically available in_**
**_non-New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreements._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral (including the right to exercise remedies) will be
subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the First
Lien Notes Collateral Agent, the Rollover Citrix Notes Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and any
applicable representative for the holders of future pari passu obligations.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the First Lien
Shared Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the First
Lien Shared Collateral or to control such proceedings, are at the direction of the First Lien Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent until the earlier to occur of (x) the discharge of our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and (y) 180
consecutive days after the occurrence of a continuing event of default under an agreement governing a series of
indebtedness that does not represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness subject to the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the acceleration of such indebtedness (subject to certain other requirements). See
“Description of the Notes—Security for the Secured Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

At any time that the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action
with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, then the
authorized representative for the Notes or other debt that has the greatest outstanding principal amount would
exercise such right to take action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The foregoing is not a summary of all material terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. For a more
detailed description, see “Description of the Notes—Security for the Secured Notes—First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.”

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee for the Notes
or the holders of the Notes may object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition or commencement of any other
insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding to (i) any proposed debtor-in-possession financing or to the use
of cash collateral that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or (ii) to the extent not
opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent, the use of the Collateral to secure debtor-in-possession
financing, in each case, subject to certain specified conditions and limited exceptions. After the filing of any
bankruptcy petition or the commencement of any other insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding, the value
of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be prohibited from raising an objection
to such proposed financing or use of cash collateral. For a description of important waivers by holders of the Notes
and limits on their rights as secured creditors under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of the
Notes—Security for the Secured Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions for New York (U.S.) law
intercreditor agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors and is governed by New York law.
See “Description of the Notes—Security for the Secured Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” The First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement does not contain provisions that typically would be included in any non-New York
jurisdiction.

**_Additional indebtedness is secured by the Collateral that will secure the Notes, and the Notes will be secured only_**
**_to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes and the guarantees, which_**
**_may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral, and there may not be sufficient
Collateral to pay all or any of the Notes. In addition, indebtedness permitted to be secured by a lien that is pari passu
with liens securing the Notes, including the First Lien Notes, the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and, with respect to certain Collateral, the Rollover Citrix Notes (referred to herein as “Additional Pari
Passu Obligations”), is secured by the same tangible and intangible assets comprising the Collateral securing the
Notes, on a pari passu basis. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar
proceeding against us or any guarantor, the Collateral securing the Additional Pari Passu Obligations and the Notes


-----

must be used to pay the Additional Pari Passu Obligations and the Notes ratably as set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement. We may incur Additional Pari Passu Obligations in the future. Any Additional Pari Passu
Obligations incurred in the future will adversely affect the relative position of the holders of the Notes with respect
to the Collateral securing such Notes.

As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024 Transaction
and this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately $17,550.1 million principal
amount of secured indebtedness under the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes, the Notes, the Rollover Citrix
Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and approximately $1,000.0 million of additional borrowing capacity
under the Revolving Facility, subject to customary conditions. Of the $17,550.1 million principal amount of secured
indebtedness, $13,712.5 million would have been secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral and $3,837.6
million would have been secured by second-priority liens on the Collateral.

No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value
of the Collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of
suitable buyers for the Collateral. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. The value of the Collateral securing the Notes could be impaired in the future as
a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition and other
future events or trends. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can
be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to pay
our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also paying the Additional Pari Passu Obligations.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us or any
guarantor, all proceeds from the Collateral will be applied first to repay the obligations in respect of the Notes and
any other Additional Pari Passu Obligations. No assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or
liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also
paying the Additional Pari Passu Obligations.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any
claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the Collateral
securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other
unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by bankruptcy_**
**_proceedings._**

The right of the applicable collateral agent to repossess and dispose or otherwise realize upon the Collateral
securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy
proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the applicable collateral agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the
applicable collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from
disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval.

Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds,
products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments,
provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection”
may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s
interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such time as
the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of
repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In
view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under
the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the applicable
collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes
would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of
“adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as


-----

to the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest or “adequate protection” with respect to such
difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for
“undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the Notes also secures our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the First Lien Notes and, with respect to certain Collateral, the Rollover Citrix Notes on a pari passu
basis. This Collateral may secure on a pari passu basis additional senior indebtedness that we or certain of our
subsidiaries incur in the future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debt and liens under the indenture that
will govern the Notes, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes
Indenture and the Credit Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted, and in certain cases could be
primed, by any increase in the indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis by such Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections as may be accepted by the creditors that have the benefit of first-priority liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The initial
purchasers did not analyze the effect of, nor participate in, any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of
the applicable collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

In the event that a bankruptcy or other insolvency case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the
Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and any Additional Pari
Passu Obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed
or other insolvency proceeding commenced.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to_**
**_perfect security interests in such Collateral and other issues generally associated with the realization of security_**
**_interests in Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party including enforceability
vis-a-vis third parties upon registration before the relevant public registries. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the applicable collateral agent is not able to
take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. Furthermore, the
indenture that will govern the Notes will contain customary exceptions to perfection actions that would be required
to be taken in order to perfect a security interest in certain types of Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires
that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, can only
be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional steps to perfect in such
property and rights are taken. If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become
guarantors under the indenture that will govern the Notes, additional financing statements would be required to be
filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting
after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets,
such as the delivery of physical collateral, subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the
execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. The Issuer and the guarantors will have limited obligations
to perfect the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the
Trustee for the Notes or the applicable collateral agent will monitor, or that we will inform such Trustee for the
Notes or applicable collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral
securing the Notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral. None of the Trustee for the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or any other applicable collateral
agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral
securing the Notes or to monitor the perfection of any security interest, or to make any filings to perfect or maintain


-----

the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing
the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties.

In addition, the security interest of the applicable collateral agent will be subject to practical challenges
generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the applicable collateral
agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these
consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the
affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the applicable collateral agent
will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets. Accordingly, the
applicable collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce against those assets and
the value of the affected Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds
will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any
of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the
secured obligations, including the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded_**
**_Property, will be excluded from the Collateral._**

Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
security documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect,
invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under
the indenture that will govern the Notes would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Trustee for the Notes, conduct activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of
indebtedness). The lien on the Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a
person that is not the issuer or guarantor of the Notes. Any such actions could reduce the pool of assets securing the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Property, will be excluded from the Collateral. Some of
these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the value of the
Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes” for the definition of “Excluded Property.”

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided by us or by a_**
**_trustee in bankruptcy._**

The indenture and the security documents that will govern the Notes will require us to cause any subsidiary
that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to provide a guarantee of the Notes and will require us to cause
such guarantor to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such guarantor holds at the time the Notes are issued or
acquires after the Notes are issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the applicable collateral
agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a
trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity
granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made
within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a
bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to
receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then such
guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be
treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy
proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is


-----

materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded
on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or
any guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect
to the Notes offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of such
bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a
result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes. To the extent that such challenge were to succeed,
the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes._**

We will conduct lien searches on the Collateral securing the Notes in the United States (but not all other
applicable jurisdictions) and cannot guarantee that these lien searches will reveal all existing liens on such
Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_We face intense competition, which could result in customer loss, fewer customer orders and reduced revenues_**
**_and margins._**

We sell our solutions and services in intensely competitive markets that are subject to rapid change. We
compete with various providers of software including portions of VMWare (Broadcom), Microsoft, AWS, F5,
Radware, A10 and Cisco, generally, as well as other pure play companies with respect to only certain of the brands
in which we operate. We also face competition for certain aspects of our product and service offerings from major
systems integrators, and our customers have alternatives to our proprietary software from open source software
providers that provide software and intellectual property, typically without charging license fees, or from other
competitors offering products through alternative business models, such as SaaS and DaaS.

Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, product
development, sales and marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and longer
operating histories than we do. This may allow our present or future competitors to develop products comparable or
superior to those we offer; adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies, evolving industry trends or customer
requirements; execute more effectively on their marketing and sales strategies and leverage their internal
relationships; and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. For
example, some of our competitors offer products outside our sector of the software market and routinely bundle
these products with their infrastructure software products. Also, some of our competitors are expanding their
competitive product offerings and strengthening their market position through increases in capital expenditures for
internal research and development.

We compete based on our ability to offer to our customers the most current and desired solution and
services features. We expect that competition will continue to be intense, and there is a risk that our competitors’
products may be less costly, more heavily discounted or free, provide better performance or include additional
features when compared to our solutions. Additionally, there is a risk that our solutions may become outdated or that
our market share may erode. Further, the announcement of the release, or the actual release, of new solutions
incorporating similar features to our solutions could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel
plans to license certain of our existing and future solution and service offerings. Existing or new solutions and
services that provide alternatives to our solutions and services could materially impact our ability to compete in
these markets. As the markets for our solutions and services, especially those solutions in early stages of
development, continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in
the computer hardware, software, cloud, networking, mobile, data sharing and related industries, could enter, or
increase their footprint in, the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we
believe price competition will remain a significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able
to maintain our historic prices and margins and we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets or against


-----

existing and future competitors, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets and as our
current competitors seek to increase market share. Further, we may see new and increased competition in different
geographic regions. The generally low barriers to entry in certain of our businesses increase the potential for
challenges from new industry competitors, whether small and medium-sized businesses or larger, more established
companies. Smaller companies new to our market may have more flexibility to develop on more agile platforms and
have greater ability to adapt their strategies and cost structures, which may give them a competitive advantage with
our current or prospective customers. We may also experience increased competition from new types of solutions as
the options for DaaS, VDI, security, application delivery, integration, master data management and analytics
offerings increase. Further, as our industry evolves and if our company grows, companies with which we have
strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas, or our current competitors may enter into new
strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures
we face.

In addition, the industry has been volatile and there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our
markets for several years. We expect companies will attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an
evolving and volatile industry. For example, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into
partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered
and more effectively address the needs of prospective customers. Additionally, as IT companies attempt to
strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving digital workspace services, networking, integration and
data sharing and analysis markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive IT solutions to end
users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions that may compete with our DaaS, VDI, security,
application delivery, integration, master data management and analytics solutions. These consolidators or potential
consolidators may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources and brand loyalty than we do,
and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary solutions and services. The companies resulting
from these possible combinations may create more compelling solution and service offerings and be able to offer
greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can. These heightened
competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all
of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our Citrix and NetScaler businesses rely, and our other businesses are expected to rely to a greater extent, as our_**
**_businesses evolve, on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control._**

The Citrix and NetScaler businesses rely significantly, and our other businesses are expected to rely to a
greater extent, as our businesses evolve, on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our
solutions and services. Our distributors generally sell through resellers. Our distributor and reseller base is relatively
concentrated. We periodically revise our sales incentive programs for our independent distributors and resellers, and
such program revisions may adversely impact our results of operations. Changes to our sales incentive programs can
result from a number of factors, including our transition to a subscription-based business model and segmentation of
our routes to market to increase efficiency. Our competitors may, in some cases, be effective in providing incentives
to current or potential distributors and resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our solutions.
The loss of or reduction in sales to our distributors or resellers could materially reduce our revenues. Further, we
could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The financial
condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment
obligations. Any significant delays, defaults or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

We also bear the risk that our channel partners will fail to comply with U.S. or international anti-corruption
or anti-competition laws, in which case we might be fined or otherwise penalized as a result of the agency
relationship with such partners. Our channel partners may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional
terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, and we
have implemented partner-specific training programs, but there can be no assurance that such policies will be
followed. For instance, in the event that sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of
which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing


-----

revenue in accordance with our sales programs. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, in
significant resources to develop these channel relationships, which could adversely impact our results of operations
if such channels do not result in increased revenues.

**_Our multi-year transition from perpetual licenses to a subscription-based business model is subject to numerous_**
**_risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

As we continue to transition our customers from perpetual licenses to subscriptions, we have seen an
impact on the timing of revenue recognition. Because subscription revenue related to our subscription solutions is
typically recognized over time, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a deferral of software
revenues and a corresponding impact on our maintenance revenues. During our transition to the subscription-based
model, our customer billings and cash collections have also been impacted. If we were to experience significant
downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns
until future periods. The subscription-based model may also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue
through additional sales in any one period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable
subscription term.

Further, while many of our subscription-based offerings involve multi-year commitments, ultimately our
subscription customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the
subscription term, or to renew only for a portion of our solutions or to renew on pricing terms that are less favorable
to us. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline, fluctuate, or not improve as a result of a number of factors,
including their level of satisfaction with our solutions, their ability to continue their operations and spending levels,
the pricing of our solutions and the availability of competing solutions. The amount of our recognized revenue also
depends on factors like the average duration of subscriptions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for
our solutions or demand pricing or other concessions prior to renewal, if our renewal rates fluctuate or decline, or if
our customers opt to purchase subscriptions with short-term durations, our total bookings and revenue will fluctuate
or decline, and our business and financial results will be negatively affected.

In addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business have evolved over the course of the
transition as significant trends emerge. The transition to a subscription-based business model also means that our
historical results, especially those achieved before we began the transition, may be difficult to compare to our future
results. If we are unable to continue to navigate our transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.

The foregoing risks and circumstances may adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_The change in our GTM strategy, particularly the expansion of cloud-based solutions (as opposed to traditional_**
**_on-premise delivery of our products) and the transition from perpetual maintenance licenses to a subscription-_**
**_based business model, and the pace of those transitions, has introduced, and may continue to introduce, risks and_**
**_uncertainties unique to such a shift in delivery and licensing, which could adversely affect our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

Our success depends, in part, on customer and user adoption of our newer products and services, and
adaptation to new delivery models. The market for solutions that meet our customers’ needs in accessing and
organizing their work in a secure way is evolving and dynamic, and we must continue to evolve to address that
market.

Expansion of our cloud-based solutions has required, and may continue to require, a considerable
investment in resources, including technical, financial, legal, sales, information technology and operational systems.
While market acceptance of such offerings has been positive, and the majority of our services are now provided
through cloud-based subscriptions, ongoing acceptance is affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited
to, security, service availability, reliability, availability of tools to automate cloud migration, scalability, integration
with public cloud platforms, customization, availability of qualified third-party service providers to assist customers
in transitioning to our cloud-based solutions, performance, pricing, current license terms, support terms, community


-----

engagement, customer preference, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data,
public concerns regarding data privacy or data protection, and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations.

To address the challenges in transitioning our remaining customers to the cloud, we have invested in
innovation and feature development, simplified cloud migration, and performance and reliability, as well as other
cloud customer success and sales initiatives. There can be no assurance, however, that these initiatives will result in
an increase in the transition of our customers from on-premise to our cloud-based solutions. If we are unable to
transition our customers to cloud-based solutions at the pace we expect, we may experience a negative impact on our
overall financial performance.

Further, our cloud-based solutions provide customers with increased visibility into the level of active use of
such solutions by the customers’ employees or other end users. This enhanced visibility may adversely impact
renewal rates if enough users in a customer organization do not actively engage with our solutions.

While we believe we are well placed to provide cloud-based solutions to all of our customers, the success
in transitioning customers to our cloud-based solutions is dependent on our ability to effectively align, prioritize and
allocate our engineering and other resources to balance the needs of maintaining our existing products, while also
innovating in future products and features, and ensuring security and resiliency.

Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market in which we_**
**_operate and our ability to respond to such conditions, including by introducing new offerings._**

The markets for our solutions and services are characterized by:

    - rapid technological change;

    - evolving delivery models;

    - evolving industry standards;

    - fluctuations in customer demand;

    - changing customer business models and increasingly sophisticated customer needs; and

    - frequent new solution and service introductions and enhancements.

The demand for our solutions and services depends substantially upon the general demand for businessrelated computer appliances and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending
levels, the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers, and general economic conditions,
including inflation and interest rates. As we continue to grow our subscription service offerings, we must continue to
innovate and develop new solutions and features to meet changing customer needs. If we are not successful in
expanding our core technologies into additional applications and products, developing enhancements to existing
products and new products in a timely manner, enhancing our service offerings or generating higher average selling
prices, our existing and potential customers may not purchase or subscribe to our products and services, our market
share, revenues and gross margins may decline, and our business and operating results may suffer. Our software
products can be licensed for use with a variety of platforms, standards and technologies, and we are constantly
evaluating the feasibility of adding new platforms, standards and technologies. There may be future or existing
platforms, standards and technologies that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be architecturally
compatible with our software products. In addition, the effort and expense of developing, testing and maintaining
software products will increase as more platforms, standards and technologies achieve market acceptance within our
target markets, which could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedule. Our


-----

failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could
lower the demand for any solutions and services and/or make our solutions uncompetitive and obsolete.

Global economic forecasts for the IT sector are uncertain and continue to highlight an industry in transition
from legacy platforms to mobile, cloud, data analytics and social and AI-based solutions . If our current and
prospective customers cut costs, they may significantly reduce their IT expenditures. For example, lower spending
by corporate and governmental customers around the world has had a disproportionate impact on IT spending,
which has led to a reduction in sales in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

Moreover, the purchase of our solutions and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant
commitment of capital and other resources. Any of our new product offerings or significant enhancements to current
product offerings could cause some customers to delay making new or additional purchases while they fully
evaluate any new offerings we might have introduced to the market, which in turn may slow sales and adversely
affect operating results for an indeterminate period of time. Also, we may not execute successfully on our product
plans because of errors in product planning or timing or acceptance by the marketplace, technical hurdles that we
fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors providing
those solutions before us, thereby resulting in loss of market share and earnings. We need to continue to develop our
skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which will require us to devote
significant resources.

Many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and
would incur significant costs in switching to third-party products, which may substantially inhibit the growth of the
market for infrastructure software. If the market fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we expect, our sales will
be adversely affected. Also, even if corporate and governmental spending increases and companies make greater
investments in IT and infrastructure software, our revenue may not grow at the same pace.

**_Any failure by us to meet the requirements of current or newly targeted customers may have a detrimental impact_**
**_on our business or operating results._**

We may wish to expand our customer base into markets in which we have limited experience. In some
cases, customers in different markets, such as financial services or government, have specific regulatory or other
requirements that we must meet. For example, in order to maintain contracts with the U.S. government, we must
comply with specific rules and regulations relating to and that govern such contracts. Government contracts are
generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and
administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. If we fail to
meet such requirements in the future, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or a reduction of revenue
which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

**_The inability to upsell to our current customers or attract new customers or the loss of any significant customers_**
**_could harm our business._**

We generally do not have long-term sales contracts with any of our customers and we are transitioning
away from the perpetual licensing model in favor of a subscription (term based) model. Our customers may choose
not to renew their subscriptions of our products or not to use our services in the future. As a result, a customer that
generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods. In addition,
all of our legacy maintenance and support agreements are sold on a term basis. In order for us to grow our revenues
and increase profitability, it is important that our existing customers renew, upgrade and expand their subscription
licenses after the initial terms expire. To this end, we have introduced two new GTM strategies: Universal
Licensing, allowing customers to deploy our software both in the cloud or on premise, and Platform Licensing,
allowing customers to use all products licensed by a specific business unit. During the fiscal year ending November
30, 2024, we intend to roll out the Platform Licensing model within the TIBCO business unit, and we are actively
consolidating the number of SKUs within all business units, which we hope will simplify our sales process and
make it easier for customers to deploy our technology. Also, our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of
a number of factors, including as a result of these changes. Any inability on our part to upsell to and generate


-----

revenues from our existing customers or the loss of significant customers or renewals of customers on terms less
favorable to us could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our future growth also depends on our ability to attract new customers through business partners and
resellers. This will depend, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing effort and the efforts of our business
partners and resellers. For our business, the ability to attract new customers can sometimes be difficult as a potential
customer may be reluctant or unwilling to change from their existing products as they may have already made
substantial personnel and financial investments in their existing products. If our business partners and resellers are
unable to attract new customers of our products and maintain and expand those relationships, it could adversely
affect our business and operating results.

**_Our solutions could contain errors that could delay the release of new products or otherwise adversely impact our_**
**_products and services._**

Despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers, our products and services,
including our SaaS products and services, and especially newly released or acquired products or services, contain
errors or “bugs”. In some cases, these errors are not discovered until after commercial shipments or deployments
have been made. Errors in our products or services could delay the development or release of new products or
services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, our products and
services use, integrate with and otherwise depend on third-party products, which third-party products could contain
defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless. Because our products and services
are often used in mission-critical applications, if defects or errors are discovered after commercial release of either
new versions or enhancements of our products and platforms:

    - potential customers may delay purchases;

    - customers may react negatively, which could reduce future sales;

    - our reputation in the marketplace may be damaged;

    - we may have to defend against product liability, warranty or other claims;

    - we may be required to indemnify our customers, distributors, OEMs or other resellers;

    - we may incur additional service and warranty costs; and

    - we may have to divert additional development resources to correct the defects and errors, which may
result in the delay of new product releases or upgrades.

If any or all of the foregoing occur, we may lose revenues, incur higher operating expenses and lose market
share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Certain of our offerings have sales cycles which are long and/or unpredictable, which could cause significant_**
**_variability and unpredictability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period._**

Generally, a substantial portion of our large and medium-sized customers implement our solutions on a
departmental or enterprise-wide basis. We have a long sales cycle for these departmental or enterprise-wide sales
because:

    - our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large-scale deployment of
our solution to potential and existing customers prior to sale;

    - our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their
testing and evaluation of our solutions and services;


-----

    - our customers are typically large and medium-sized organizations that carefully research their
technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software
infrastructure; and

    - before making a purchase, our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of
decision makers within their organizations, and this process can be lengthy.

Our long sales cycle for these solutions makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we
may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis. In addition, the long sales cycle for these solutions
makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability
in our bookings, revenue and/or operating results for any particular period, and large projects with significant IT
components may fail to meet our customers’ business requirements or be canceled before delivery, which likewise
could adversely affect our revenue and operating results for any particular period. Cloud-based solutions and
subscription-based business models are particularly sensitive to these factors, and as a result, we may be
increasingly affected by long sales cycles as our business transitions continue.

Overall, the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an
uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur in the last month, weeks and
days of each quarter. In addition, our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and such fluctuations are generally
most significant in our fourth fiscal quarter and, as Citrix had a fiscal year end of December 31, for the first month
of our first fiscal quarter, which we believe is due to the impact on revenue from the availability (or lack thereof) in
our customers’ fiscal year budgets and an increase in expenses resulting from amounts paid pursuant to our sales
compensation plans as performance milestones are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these
seasonal factors are common within our industry. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower
sales in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer.

**_Economic and market conditions are currently uncertain, and have in the past adversely affected, and may in the_**
**_future adversely affect, our operating results._**

We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes and uncertainty in domestic and global economies.
For example, past domestic and global economic downturns resulted in reduced demand for information technology,
including enterprise software and services. Additionally, current economic and market conditions are uncertain. The
direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain and volatile, and could be adversely
affected by, among other things:

    - current uncertainties in the global and domestic economies, including disruption in the banking sector;

    - global risks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and developments in the Middle East;

    - the price of oil and its related effects on the economy;

    - the rate of inflation and whether and how long inflation will continue to run at a rate higher than it
historically has;

    - changes in interest rates;

    - volatility in the stock markets globally;

    - political and economic changes and uncertainty in the United States and elsewhere, including in
connection with the 2024 election cycle in the United States;

    - uncertainty or renegotiation of trade agreements between the United States and other countries;

    - changes in the trading and political relationship between the United States and China;


-----

    - downturns in the financial industry;

    - volatility in currency exchange rates;

    - increasingly divergent laws, regulations and licensing requirements between the UK and the EU,
resulting from the UK’s exit from the EU, often referred to as “Brexit”; and

    - terrorist attacks and other geopolitical factors, including relationships between the United States and
each of Russia, North Korea and Iran.

These and other factors make it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about
future investments. We cannot predict the duration of these economic or political conditions and the impact they
may have on our customers or business. In response to economic uncertainty, we expect that many governmental
organizations that are current or prospective customers for our solutions and services would cutback spending
significantly, which would reduce the amount of government spending on IT and demand for our solutions and
services from government organizations. Contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult if
customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract
terms and conditions. These economic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic
environment, are beyond our control and could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles,
difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments, slower adoption of new technologies, increased
price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and
procure consulting services.

**_Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services or cyberattacks on our services_**
**_infrastructure or corporate networks could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

Use of our products and services may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain
instances our own and our customers’ and other parties’ business, financial and personal data. As we continue to
evolve our products and features, we expect to host, transmit or otherwise have access to increasing amounts of
potentially sensitive data. Our products and services are deployed across both cloud and on-premise environments
and provide different security risks. Unlike cloud, the on-premise environment subjects potentially sensitive data to
the maintenance measures of the customer and limits data recovery options. Maintaining the security of our
products, computer networks and data storage resources is important and service vulnerabilities could result in loss
of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have in the past, and may in the future, discover
vulnerabilities in our products or underlying technology, which could expose our reputation, our operations, our
customers and the data held by our customers to risk. Generally, we address theses vulnerabilities through product
patches that are promptly applied across our cloud environment. However, patches for on-premise environments are
controlled by the customer. Although we encourage prompt application of patches, we cannot ultimately control
whether customers apply them. Customer delay in patch application can prolong detected vulnerabilities in our
products. For example, in October 2023, we released builds to fix CVE-2023-4966, which affected our NetScaler
ADC and NetScaler Gateway on-premises products. If exploited, CVE 2023-4966 can result in unauthorized data
disclosure. Although we urged our customers to apply the patch to their impacted products immediately, CVE-20234966 was widely exploited by threat actors in attacks, some of which included unauthorized access to, and
exfiltration of, our customers’ data from their environments. Such attacks on our customers’ environments has
resulted in litigation and a regulatory inquiry. See “Note 13—Legal Proceedings” to our audited consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for additional information. In addition, to the extent
we are diverting our resources to address and mitigate these vulnerabilities, it may hinder our ability to deliver and
support our products and customers in a timely manner.

As a more general matter, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, alter, disclose, delete or
otherwise compromise our confidential information or that of our employees, partners, customers or their end users,
create system disruptions, product or service vulnerabilities or cause shutdowns. These unauthorized parties are
becoming increasingly sophisticated, particularly those funded by or acting as formal or informal representatives of,
or acting in conjunction with, nation states. Perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy


-----

viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that directly or indirectly attack our products,
services, infrastructure (including third-party cloud service providers upon which we rely), third-party software and
applications that we deploy in our internal network. Because techniques used by these perpetrators to sabotage or
obtain unauthorized access to our systems change frequently and sometimes are not recognized until long after being
launched against a target, because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and through a wide
variety of methods, and because the full scope of a cyberattack may not be realized until an investigation has been
completed, we may be unable to anticipate the techniques used or to implement adequate preventative or response
measures. Such threats may see their frequency increased and effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial
intelligence. In addition, certain measures that could increase the security of our IT systems take significant time and
resources to deploy broadly, and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an
attack. Despite our efforts to build secure services, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent,
timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises. Like
many enterprises, we experience attempted attacks on our network and services, and certain of those attacks have
resulted in successful unauthorized access to our networks and services. In 2021, we learned that certain open source
libraries included in certain of our products and services, as well as in software and services provided by our
vendors and used internally, contained vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would enable a remote attacker to take
control of an environment over the internet. There is no guarantee that our preventative and mitigation actions with
respect to this vulnerability and others like it will eliminate fully the risk of a malicious compromise of the company
or our customers. Any of these events could expose us to substantial litigation expenses and damages; consumer
claims; indemnity and other contractual obligations; government fines, penalties and enforcement actions (including
investigations, audits or inspections); mitigation expenses; and other liabilities. If an actual or perceived breach of
our security occurs, the market perception of the adequacy of our security measures could be harmed, our brand and
reputation could be impacted, we could lose potential sales and existing customers, our ability to operate our
business could be impaired, and we may incur significant liabilities.

Our products operate in conjunction with, and are dependent on, a wide variety of third-party products,
components and services. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these products, components or services, and if
there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction,
reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and
have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make
significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such
risks when we integrate these companies within the Company. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade
adequate safeguards by or with respect to our third-party vendors or acquisitions could have a material and adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant disruption to our IT systems, or
those of our vendors or acquisitions, or breaches of data security could also have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operations.

Some of the factors that may lead to a breach or compromise in our customers’ and our customers’
customers’ data, our services, and third party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or
third-party service partners holding our data, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet include the following:

    - third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive
information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data
or IT systems, or our data or IT systems;

    - efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated attacks, such as retaliatory cyber-attacks
stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including ransomware and distributed denial-of-service
attacks;

    - third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and
functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false,
misleading or malicious;


-----

    - cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate, or
on third-party cloud-computing platform providers;

    - vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing product and service offerings;

    - vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our products and
services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on;

    - vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired
companies;

    - attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the
Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our
vendors, partners or customers; and

    - employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.

If any of these factors were to occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

These misappropriations, cyberattacks or any other compromises of our security measures (or those of our
customers or third parties with which we work) as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error,
vulnerabilities, theft, malfeasance or otherwise could result in (among other consequences):

    - loss or destruction of customer, employee, partner and other intellectual property or business or
personal data;

    - disruptions in the operation of our business, such as interruption in the delivery of our cloud and other
services;

    - costs associated with investigating, responding to and remediating the root cause, including additional
monitoring of systems for unauthorized activity;

    - negative publicity and harm to our reputation or brand, which could result in lost trust from our
customers, partners and employees and could lead some customers to seek to cancel subscriptions, stop
using certain of our products or services, reduce or delay future purchases of our products or services,
or use competing products or services;

    - individual and/or class action lawsuits, due to, among other things, the compromise of sensitive
employee or customer information, which could result in financial judgments against us or the
payment of settlement amounts and cause us to incur legal fees and costs;

    - as further detailed below, regulatory enforcement action in the United States at both the federal and
state level (such as by the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorneys general) or in other
jurisdictions under the growing number of data protection legal regimes, including, without limitation,
the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act
(“CCPA”) or other similar federal, state or local laws, which could result in significant fines and/or
penalties or other sanctions and which would cause us to incur legal fees and costs;

    - costs associated with responding to those impacted by such issues, such as costs of providing data
owners, consumers, regulators or others with notice; legal fees; costs of any additional fraud detection
activities required by such customers’ credit card issuers; and costs incurred by credit card issuers
associated with the compromise;


-----

    - disputes with our insurance carriers concerning coverage for the costs associated with responding to,
and mitigating an incident; and/or

    - longer-term remediation and security enhancement expenses.

Any of these actions could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Further, while we maintain multiple layers of oversight over enterprise cybersecurity and data protection
risks associated with our products, services, information technology infrastructure and related operations, there is no
guarantee that our oversight framework will be successful in providing the necessary governance to prevent or
adequately respond to the actions described above.

**_Aspects of our business are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, contractual obligations and industry_**
**_standards concerning privacy, security and data protection, and the failure to comply with these may adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

Aspects of our business may involve the transmission, collection, receipt, generation, use, transfer, making
accessible, protection, securing, disposal of, sharing and processing of personal information and sensitive personal
information and other sensitive information, which may include proprietary and confidential business data, trade
secrets, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transaction information and financial information. This
information may be subject to federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and protection of data. For
example, in the United States, regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (as amended or
supplemented), which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (as amended or supplemented), which regulates the use and
disclosure of personal health information, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the U.S. Department
of Defense Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification framework impose significant requirements and obligations
on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. From time to time Congress also has considered,
and may currently be considering, various proposals for other privacy laws to which we may become subject if
passed. Additionally, under various privacy laws and other obligations, we may be required to obtain certain
consents to process personal data, including through the use of tracking technologies on our website. Our inability or
failure to do so could result in adverse consequences, including fines, penalties or litigation. There has been, and we
believe that there will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of
personal, financial, government and other information. For example, California enacted the CCPA which, among
other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers
abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides statutory damages or fines on a per
violation basis that could be very large in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation.
California also enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023,
and which modifies the CCPA to impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in
California, including consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data
and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. Following California, a number of other states have passed, or are
currently considering, comprehensive privacy laws. In the absence of a federal comprehensive privacy law
preempting such state laws, state-led privacy legislation poses compliance challenges, costs, and operational and
legal burdens.

Europe, the United Kingdom and many other jurisdictions around the world have passed, are updating or
are currently considering legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, data security and the collection
and use of personal data (including, without limitation, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK General
Data Protection Regulation, the Australian Privacy Act, the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information,
and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law) that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more
significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. Many of these laws
provide for fines based on a percentage of a company’s global annual revenue.

While we are actively monitoring privacy and data protection regulatory activity, we take a risk-based
approach to prioritizing our data protection compliance efforts. Our compliance efforts with these various laws in
our higher risk jurisdictions have already caused us to incur substantial implementation and compliance costs and/or
required us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and new obligations may have


-----

similar effects in the future. Also, any new law or regulation, or interpretation of existing law or regulation,
imposing greater fees or taxes or restrictions on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally
or over the internet, could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our solutions and our results of
operations. Finally, as a technology vendor, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate
compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we
make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices. Our inability to do so may
adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated
industries, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand,
reputation and business.

Additionally, we may have contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of our
customer data (including personal data). While we have implemented these contracts and have diligence procedures,
policies and programs designed to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, GDPR, UK GDPR and other applicable
privacy and data security laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners,
suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and
procedures. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy notices, our contractual obligations or other
federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings
against us by governmental entities, individuals or others, which could harm our business, operating results and
financial condition. Additionally, if our privacy policies, marketing materials or other statements regarding data
privacy and security are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misrepresentative of our
practices or out of compliance with any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigation,
enforcement actions by regulators, litigation or other adverse consequences.

In addition to government activity and contractual obligations, privacy advocacy and other industry groups
have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to
provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards
established by third-parties that we have obtained for certain services, such as SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, ISO
27701, PCI DSS, IRAP, and FedRAMP Moderate. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these
standards, it may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in
highly-regulated industries, and could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and
could harm our business.

The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws, as well as cybersecurity
requirements and industry standards in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and elsewhere can be
uncertain and continue to remain in flux. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data
localization and portability requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data, the
operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time. It is possible that these laws, obligations
and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in
addition to the possibility of fines and penalties, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available
to competent supervisory authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations, including a governmental order
requiring that we change our data practices, extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order temporary or
permanent bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by non-compliant actors, which in turn could
harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with these regulations, obligations and
standards may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue.
Noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we cease conducting the noncompliant
activity. Finally, as a technology vendor, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate
compliance with current data privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our privacy policies and the
information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices. Any of the
foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our sales, business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business or financial condition._**

Failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis may impact depositors’ access to their cash
deposits at financial institutions and create disruption in capital and credit markets. For example, events surrounding
Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank during 2023 created temporary uncertainty on their


-----

customers’ cash deposits in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits prior to actions taken by
governmental entities. In addition, in 2024, Republic First Bank collapsed. We had no direct exposure to Silicon
Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, Signature Bank or Republic First Bank. While we maintain our cash deposits
across a variety of highly rated financial institutions, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions will not
experience similar liquidity issues or that actions taken by governmental entities to mitigate these risks will be
sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits and sources of liquidity. Moreover, a liquidity crisis may also result
in additional disruption that is not immediately evident but which results in, for example, negative impact on the
ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us in a timely basis or at all and changes in interest rates and
availability of credit that impact the nature and timing of customer projects. As a result, a failure of one or more
financial institutions with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.

**_Interruptions or delays in services provided by third parties could impair the delivery of our service and harm our_**
**_business._**

We currently rely on third-party suppliers who provide hardware or hardware components for our products,
provide our cloud based solutions through third party providers, serve our customers from third‑party data center
facilities and resources located throughout the world and utilize third party contractors. We also rely on bandwidth
providers, Internet service providers, mobile networks and other third-party IT service providers to operate our
business and to deliver our solutions. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could
result in interruptions to our service.

Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure
to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the need to implement
costly or time-consuming protocols to comply with applicable regulations (including regulations related to conflict
minerals), equipment malfunction, natural disasters and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede
their ability to meet our demand. We also may experience disruptions or delays to our supply chain or fulfillment
and delivery operations from, among other things, the temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer
facilities, spikes in demand for manufacturing services, interruptions in product supply or insufficient supply of
components, restrictions on export or shipment or disruptions in product fulfillment due to closure or delays of our
delivery vendors. If we are unable to procure hardware and hardware components in a timely manner from our
existing suppliers or are required to change suppliers, there could be a delay in the supply of our hardware or
hardware components and our ability to meet the demands of our customers could be adversely affected, which
could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers and delayed revenue recognition, all of which could
adversely affect our results of operations.

In addition, our cloud-based solutions are primarily operated through third-party cloud service providers,
which we do not control and which may be subject to actual or perceived damage, interruption, vulnerabilities and
other cyber-related risks, including, but not limited to, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery of services,
network outages, disruptions in availability of the internet, unauthorized access or other problems. Customers of our
cloud-based solutions need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of
performance, and we provide them with service level commitments with respect to uptime. Third-party cloud
providers run their own platforms that we access, and therefore, we are vulnerable to their service interruptions. We
may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of
problems with our third-party cloud providers’ infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due
to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot
predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our SLAs and the issuance of credits to our cloud
offering customers, which may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our
security, or that of any of these third-party cloud providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our
customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the
cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It is possible
that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a thirdparty cloud provider’s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third
parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our
liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider. It may also become increasingly


-----

difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes
more complex and the usage of our software increases.

Further, if for any reason our arrangement with one or more of our data centers is terminated, we could
experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities and support. Our data center facilities providers have
no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to
renew our agreements with the facilities providers on commercially reasonable terms or if in the future we add
additional data center facility providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or
the addition of, new data center facilities. In addition, the failure of our data centers to meet our capacity
requirements could result in interruptions in the availability of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions
or impede our ability to scale our operations. As we continue to add data centers and increase capacity in existing
and future data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during
such processes and procedures, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service, and we may
experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer of data to other facilities. Similarly, some of our
solutions’ features run or depend on IT services run by third parties, such as data feeds or public clouds such as
AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, and an extended failure of such services might materially and adversely
impact our ability to provide our services to our customers.

**_Our AI offerings introduce risks, which, if realized, could adversely impact our business._**

We use artificial intelligence (“AI”) and analytics in our cloud-based solutions and have announced
partnerships on AI-related innovations. For example, we recently announced an eight-year strategic partnership with
Microsoft that will support the development of new cloud-based and AI solutions. Our engineering organizations are
deploying GitHub Copilot to all their engineers with the goal of increasing developer productivity, and Spotfire, a
Cloud Software business unit, recently announced a new Spotfire Copilot extension built on Microsoft Azure
OpenAI service.

AI technologies are complex, rapidly advancing and present risks spanning, among other factors,
development, training, sourcing, usage, IP leakage, investment and compliance. For example, datasets used to
develop AI models, content generated by AI systems or application of AI systems may be unexpected, flawed,
biased, offensive, harmful or violative of confidentiality agreements or current or future laws and regulations or may
raise privacy concerns; and the way in which our offerings incorporate and use AI may be incompatible with our
customers’ compliance requirements. Any perceived or actual inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or
our partners could impair the acceptance of our AI solutions, give rise to legal liability, harm our brand or reputation
and negatively impact our financial results.

Additionally, if any of our employees, contractors, vendors or service providers use any third-party AIpowered software in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent
disclosure of our confidential information, including inadvertent disclosure of our confidential information into
publicly available third-party training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately
maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or confidential information, harming our competitive position
and business. Our ability to mitigate risks associated with disclosure of our confidential information, including in
connection with AI-powered software, will depend on our implementation, maintenance, monitoring and
enforcement of appropriate technical and administrative safeguards, policies and procedures governing the use of AI
in our business.

AI technologies also present unique ethical issues and the regulatory landscape is evolving. For example, in
Europe, on March 13, 2024, the European Parliament formally adopted a draft of the European Union’s Artificial
Intelligence Act (the “AI Act”) which is currently expected to be enacted in mid-2024, pending formal endorsement
by the Council of the European Union and publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The current
draft of the AI Act, if enacted, would establish, among other things, a risk-based governance framework for
regulating AI systems operating in the European Union. AI-related regulations may develop at different rates and
inconsistently across jurisdictions, require us to develop AI-specific governance controls, increase investment costs
and cause delays in, or disruption to, our offerings. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data on which our
AI solutions rely, we may incur liability through the violation of such regulations, third-party intellectual property,
publicity or privacy rights or other rights or contracts to which we are a party. Further, our introduction or


-----

enablement of new AI offerings or features may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,
litigation, ethical concerns or other complications that could adversely affect our return on investment, ability to
compete or reputation. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We rely on third parties in many aspects of operating our business, which creates additional risk._**

We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business operations, including third parties that provide
certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations, and
third parties that provide facilities, IT infrastructure, components and services, including cloud computing.

Third parties that we rely on may fail or refuse to perform critical operational tasks adequately, and these
and other third parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us, refuse to renew these agreements on
commercially reasonable terms, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs
or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. Financial or regulatory issues, labor
issues, or other problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers could harm
our business. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could
result in customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation, and harm our business.

Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies
that we rely on to provide services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Some
third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices without
competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or
our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing
services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy or other business
interruption, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and
on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to adequately manage the risks associated with outsourcing aspects of our
business to third-parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

**_The reorganization of our sales leadership, customer-facing organization and sales processes may be disruptive_**
**_to our operations and may not yield the short or long-term benefits that we expect._**

While our business model transition is continuing to progress to focus on our subscription and cloud-based
offerings, we expect to face challenges in retaining our sales personnel. In an effort to address these challenges, we
have reorganized our sales leadership, re-aligned our customer-facing organization, enhanced our focus on indirect
channels, and largely transitioned to sales of subscription licenses. We also have taken, and may continue to take,
actions intended to re-align channel incentives to focus on landing and growing new business in the commercial
segment of our business. These changes are significant and may cause short-term disruption.

We may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining sales personnel with the knowledge and skills required
to market our products and services effectively as part of our GTM strategy. As a result, there may be periods of
time when our sales force is not at its desired headcount, which may result in fewer sales of our products and
services.

This sales reorganization may not result in the short or long-term benefits that we expect in a timely
manner or at all. Moreover, these changes, or other similar changes that we may choose to make, may cause
disruptions in our business that may negatively impact sales over one or more future quarters. Risks related to these
activities include:

    - challenges in reorganizing sales operations and personnel;

    - inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified direct quota carrying sales personnel;

    - reduced productivity among new sales team members or while members of the sales team adjust to
their new roles and responsibilities and our new sales priorities;


-----

    - loss of key employees;

    - inability to re-engage distributors, resellers and other channel partners due to changing market
demands or competitive offerings;

    - higher sales, marketing and services costs;

    - lengthening of sales cycles as customers evaluate their cloud strategy and competitive offerings; and

    - continued difficulties in accurately forecasting bookings and revenue and the estimated mix within
subscription of on-premise versus cloud.

If the disruptions caused by these operational and organizational changes are greater or longer than
anticipated, we are unable to maintain an adequate workforce of direct quota carrying sales personnel or we are
unable to achieve the expected benefits of these activities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
may be adversely affected.

**_If we are unable to align our indirect sales channels to our go-to-market strategy, our business operations and_**
**_financial condition may be adversely affected._**

In addition to our direct sales force, we use indirect sales channel partners, such as OEMs, technology
partners, systems integrators, exclusive distributors and resellers. Indirect sales channel partners are an important
aspect of our business, and our primary route to market for the commercial and subscale international segments of
our business. Our future growth in revenues and profitability depends in part on our ability to identify, establish,
engage and retain successful channel partner relationships, which will take significant time and resources and
involve significant risk.

We have established, and are in the process of extending, long term partnerships in certain regions with the
goal of outsourcing our sales and services organizations in those regions. These partnerships require significant
administrative and operational ramp up efforts, as well as investment in training and systems implementation. While
we are making every effort to ensure that we are selecting the best suited business partners, we cannot be certain that
they will be able to attain the levels of revenue achievement expected by the respective organizations.

We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify suitable indirect sales channel partners. To the extent
we do identify such partners, we will need to negotiate the terms of a commercial agreement with them under which
the partner would distribute our products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate commerciallyattractive terms with any channel partner, if at all. In addition, all channel partners must be trained to distribute our
products. In order to develop our distribution channel, we must develop and improve our processes for channel
partner introduction and training.

We also cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain successful relationships with any channel
partners. These channel partners may not have an exclusive relationship with us and may offer customers the
products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. With or without an exclusive
relationship, we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources for selling our products. A
lack of support by any of our channel partners may harm our ability to develop, market, sell or support our products,
as well as harm our brand. There can be no assurance that our channel partners will comply with the terms of our
commercial agreements with them, including, for example, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and U.S. export and trade controls, or will continue to work with us when our commercial agreements with them
expire or are up for renewal. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners, or these
channel partners fail to live up to their contractual obligations, our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be harmed.


-----

**_In order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate_**
**_succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our_**
**_business._**

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and integrate qualified
executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring
externally, training and retaining a diverse, global population of highly-skilled engineering, technical and security
professionals, and managerial, sales and services, finance and marketing personnel are critical to our future, and
global competition for experienced and diverse employees can be intense.

In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must
provide a competitive compensation package. In certain cases, we are competing against companies with greater
financial resources and name recognition for these executives and other key employees, and as such, there is no
assurance that we will be able to meet our hiring needs or hire the most qualified candidates. In order to attract and
retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must also provide a diverse and
inclusive environment, and offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health. Our inability to do
so may limit our effectiveness in attracting, retaining and motivating our executives and key employees. Failure to
successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a
significant impact on our operations.

The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future
or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations. Failure to retain institutional knowledge and to
ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic
planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any
failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

**_Sales and renewals of our support solutions constitute a decreasing portion of our unearned revenue._**

We anticipate that sales and renewals of our support solutions will continue to constitute a decreasing
portion of our unearned revenue due to our transition to subscription-based solutions. Our ability to continue to
generate both recognized and unearned revenue from our support solutions will depend on our customers continuing
to perceive value in automatic delivery of our software upgrades and enhancements and the pace of our transition to
subscription-based solutions. The discontinued broad availability of perpetual licenses has resulted in the loss of
future opportunities to sell support solutions. Additionally, a decrease in demand for our support solutions could
occur as a result of a decrease in demand for our other products. If our customers do not continue to purchase our
support solutions, our unearned revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would
be adversely affected.

**_Our international presence subjects us to additional risks that could harm our business._**

We earn a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign
direct and indirect operations. Potential growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international
operations. To successfully maintain and expand international sales, we may need to establish additional foreign
operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. Our international
operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could adversely affect the results of our international operations.
These risks include:

    - compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, including the requirement to submit
additional technical information for product registration in order to sell in certain countries;

    - variability of foreign economic, political, labor conditions and global policy uncertainty, including relocating operations internationally;


-----

    - risks associated with doing business with foreign government entities, including complex procurement
processes, public sector budgetary cycles and availability, termination rights which exceed those
typical in the private sector and being subject to audits as government contractors;

    - currency exchange rate fluctuations;

    - changing restrictions imposed by regulatory or contractual requirements or limitations, tariffs, quotas
or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws;

    - regional data privacy, security, secrecy and related laws that apply to the transmission of and
protection of our and our customers’ data across international borders;

    - health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic;

    - difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    - longer accounts receivable payment cycles;

    - potentially adverse tax consequences;

    - difficulties in enforcing and protecting intellectual property rights, including increased difficulty as a
foreign entity in those international locations;

    - providing technical information in order to obtain foreign filing licenses for filing our patent
applications in certain countries;

    - increased risk of non-compliance by foreign employees, partners, distributors, resellers and agents or
other intermediaries with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import
control laws and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;

    - burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;

    - expansion of cloud-based products and services may increase risk in countries where cloud computing
infrastructures are more susceptible to data intrusions or may be controlled directly or indirectly by
foreign governments;

    - our software and data of our customers being stored in foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to us
being required to disclose or provide access to data or intellectual property to a foreign government
pursuant to national security or other laws of such foreign jurisdiction; and

    - as we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if required, we may experience difficulty
transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.

Additionally, an increasing number of jurisdictions are imposing data localization laws, which require
personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information, to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. For
example, Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of
personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom
(“UK”) have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose
privacy laws it believes are inadequate. These regulations may deter customers from using cloud-based services
such as ours, and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer
services in those markets without significant additional costs. We do not own or operate servers in Russia. As such,
to-date, we have not offered our cloud-based offerings in Russia.


-----

We operate an engineering and customer support organization in China. Under the China Cyber Security
Law (the “CSL”), network operators are required to provide technical support and assistance to public and state
security authorities in national security and criminal investigations. The law does not provide details on the extent of
technical support and assistance that may be required. There is the possibility that network operators may be
required to disclose or provide access to information or data communicated or transmitted through the network
owned, utilized or managed by the network operator to comply with the support and assistance requirement of the
CSL. While we do not consider the Company to be a network operator, there is the possibility that China could
decide to treat the Company as a network operator, and we would need to comply with this law.

We have had and may, from time to time, enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures, OEM or similar
business relationships with entities in foreign jurisdictions, including governmental or quasi-governmental entities,
pursuant to which we may be required to license or transfer certain of our intellectual property rights to such entities.
Such relationships could expose us to increased risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our intellectual
property, economic and political risks, and contractual enforcement issues.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks. Any of these factors,
either individually or in combination, could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our
business or results of operations.

**_We may be unable to fully realize anticipated cost savings related to actions previously initiated by us, which_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

As of February 28, 2024, there are $164 million of planned cost savings from previously initiated actions
that are driven by reductions in personnel, optimization of facility usage and the consolidation or rationalization of
events, vendors and tools. However, our ability to fully achieve cost savings currently estimated, or at all, is subject
to various assumptions by our management, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other
costs in our operations that may offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a consequence, we may not be able to
fully realize the identified cost savings or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in
order to realize these cost savings. Failure to fully achieve the anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our presentation of Further Adjusted EBITDA in this
offering circular reflects such estimated cost savings but does not reflect such costs. Accordingly, you should not
view our presentation of these adjustments in our Further Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve
these cost savings but rather only as an indication of our current expectations and to show how Further Adjusted
EBITDA will be calculated for the purposes of monitoring covenant compliance in the Credit Agreement, the First
Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture and the indenture that
will govern the Notes.

**Risks Related to Acquisitions, Strategic Relationships and Divestitures**

**_Acquisitions and divestitures present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we_**
**_anticipate._**

Our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in
response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. We have in the past addressed,
and may continue to address, the development of new solutions and services and enhancements to existing solutions
and services through acquisitions of other companies, product lines and/or technologies.

Acquisitions, including those of high-technology companies, are inherently risky. We cannot provide any
assurance that any of our acquisitions or future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and
strategic goals. The risks we commonly encounter in undertaking, managing and integrating acquisitions are:

    - an uncertain revenue and earnings stream from the acquired company, which could dilute our earnings;

    - difficulties and delays integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, solutions and systems of the
acquired companies;


-----

    - costs of integrating acquired companies in international transactions due to, among other things, local
laws and regulations;

    - difficulties operating acquired companies as a stand-alone business, if desired, to further our objectives
and strategy;

    - undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in solutions of the acquired companies;

    - our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by
acquisition, transition or integration activities;

    - challenges and costs associated with implementing adequate and appropriate controls, procedures and
policies in the acquired business;

    - difficulties and costs associated with managing or integrating an acquired company’s technologies or
lines of business;

    - potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and
development;

    - entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have
stronger market positions and which are highly competitive;

    - the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;

    - potential difficulties integrating the acquired solutions and services into our sales channel or challenges
selling acquired products;

    - assuming pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have
otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our
business;

    - being subject to unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an
acquired company’s practices;

    - potential difficulties securing financing necessary to consummate substantial acquisitions;

    - incurring a significant amount of debt to finance an acquisition, which would increase our debt service
requirements, expense and leverage;

    - intellectual property claims or disputes; and

    - litigation arising from an acquisition.

Our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies due to these or other factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to identify and
successfully complete and integrate transactions, or successfully operate acquired companies on a stand-alone basis,
that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and
technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Any future divestitures we make may also involve risks and uncertainties. Any such divestitures could
result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, exposure to
unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture. For
example, in connection with a divestiture, we may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic


-----

relationships, including long-term services arrangements, or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in
any such transaction, which may result in additional expense. Further, if we do not realize the expected benefits or
synergies of such transactions, our operating results and financial conditions could be adversely affected.

In addition, we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies
with greater financial resources. Therefore, we may engage in discussions for, and incur expenses and fees for,
acquisitions that do not ultimately occur. This could result in a diversion of our management’s time and increased
expenses. Additionally, in order to finance any acquisition, we may need to raise additional funds through public or
private financings or a capital contribution, or to use our cash reserves. In that event, we may not be able to raise
additional funds or we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us. Use
of our cash reserves for acquisitions could limit our financial flexibility in the future. The terms of existing or future
loan agreements may place limits on our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions. If we are not able to
acquire strategically attractive businesses, products or technologies, we may not be able to remain competitive in our
industry or achieve our overall growth plans.

**_We identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting following the Merger. Failure_**
**_to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to produce_**
**_timely and accurate financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business._**

In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2022, we identified a
material weakness in our internal controls relating to accounting and disclosures associated with the Merger, which
has not yet been remediated. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In particular, we determined that we should
ensure that individuals with appropriate competence and authority evaluate and review the accounting for
acquisitions.

We believe that the material weakness was isolated to processes surrounding the acquisition accounting for
the Merger and we are in the process of remediating the material weakness to ensure it does not recur. For example,
we are in the process of adding additional qualified accounting personnel to our reporting team, adding additional
controls and increasing the levels of review to ensure that the material weakness does not recur.

While we are undertaking efforts to remediate this material weakness, the material weakness will not be
considered remediated until our remediation plans have been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for
a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced
controls are operating effectively. As there were no business combinations or similar transactions affecting the
Company during fiscal 2023, management was unable to implement its remediation plans and, thus, unable to test
such remediation. Therefore, at this time, we cannot predict the success of our remediation efforts or the outcome of
our assessment of such efforts. We also can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be
identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial
statements, which could materially adversely affect us.

**_If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets, including technology purchased in acquisitions, are_**
**_impaired, we would be required to take a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_results of operations._**

We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, such as product related intangible
assets, from our acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite
lives. However, we do amortize certain product related technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles and
we periodically evaluate them for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment annually, or sooner if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value, at the reporting unit level, which
for us also represents our operating segment. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of our
goodwill and intangible assets, including estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates,
estimating the applicable tax rates, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, projecting the future industry trends and
market conditions, and making other assumptions. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates


-----

we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates, may
materially affect our results of operations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, including changes in our
reporting structure, could materially affect our determinations of fair value. In addition, due to uncertain market
conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to
support our goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges
that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Also, we may make divestitures of
businesses in the future. If we determine that any of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions is impaired
or goodwill is impaired, then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off
completely by taking a charge to current earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of
those assets, or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future, our operating
results could be materially and adversely affected.

**_Our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

We have several strategic and technology relationships with large and complex organizations, such as
Microsoft, Google and other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services. We
depend on the companies with which we have strategic relationships to successfully test our solutions, to incorporate
our technology into their products and to market and sell those solutions. There can be no assurance we will realize
the expected benefits from these strategic relationships or that they will continue in the future. If successful, these
relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, such relationships carry an
element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we
have a strategic relationship and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if
these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in
product development, reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Brand Recognition**

**_Our efforts to protect our intellectual property or technology (including any later developed or acquired intellectual_**
**_property or technology) may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business._**

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely primarily on a combination of
copyright, service mark, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual
provisions to protect our source code, innovations and other intellectual property, all of which offer only limited
protection. The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, tradename, patent or copyright could have a material
adverse effect on our business. Despite our precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights or steal, or misappropriate, copy,
disclose or reverse engineer our proprietary information, including certain portions of our solutions or to otherwise
obtain and use our proprietary source code. We have sought to protect our intellectual property through offensive
litigation and may seek other avenues for enforcement or for return on our investment in our patent portfolio, which
may be costly and unsuccessful and/or subject us to successful counterclaims or challenges to our intellectual
property rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate, and we may choose not to
pursue or maintain protection for our intellectual property in the United States or foreign jurisdictions. In addition,
our ability to monitor and control theft, misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries
outside of the United States as the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our
proprietary information as do the laws of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property from
infringement and our proprietary source code against unauthorized theft, copying, disclosure or use, we could lose
market share, including as a result of unauthorized third parties’ development of solutions and technologies similar
to or better than ours.

The scope of our patent protection may be affected by changes in legal precedent and patent office
interpretation of these precedents. Software-based patents are difficult to obtain and enforce in many jurisdictions
and there may also be limits on recovery for damages in those jurisdictions. Further, any patents owned by us could
be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being


-----

currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of protection we seek, if at all; and if issued, may not provide
any meaningful protection or competitive advantage.

Our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law and the
enforceability of licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our sales from
licensing our solutions under “click-to-accept” license agreements that are not signed by licensees and through
electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which could be
unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our solutions. Moreover, with
respect to the various confidentiality, license or other agreements we utilize with third parties related to their use of
our solutions and technologies, there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements.

We may depend on third-party licensors of technology to enforce and protect intellectual property rights that
we may license, and such third parties may refuse to enforce and protect such intellectual property rights. Further, if
we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights (such as initiating infringement lawsuit against
a third party), the results of such proceedings, regardless of merit, are uncertain and our success cannot be assured.
Even if we were to prevail, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. Any litigation that may be necessary
in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our efforts to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and trade secrets may not be successful,_**
**_which could materially and adversely affect our business._**

We may now or in the future rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain a
competitive position. While we seek to protect such proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality and
invention assignment agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors, advisors, consultants and other third
parties, we cannot guarantee that we have entered or will enter into such agreements with each party that has or may
have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information, or that these agreements will not be breached. We may
not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or
misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition,
some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our
trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would
have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets,
now or in the future, were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or other third party, our
competitive position could be materially and adversely harmed.

We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical
security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have
confidence in these measures, they may be breached or insufficient, and we may not have adequate remedies for any
such breach or insufficiency.

We may now or in the future engage in business and technology collaborations with third-party partners that
may result in the partner owning, or the parties jointly owning, certain intellectual property, which may be based on
or derived from our or the partner’s proprietary information or existing intellectual property. If we do not have
adequate rights to use such partner-owned proprietary information or intellectual property, we may be restricted from
using it in our process, products or services. If we and the partner jointly own any such intellectual property, the
partner may have the ability to compete with our products and services, or we may be required to make royalty or
similar payments to our partner for our use of such intellectual property.

**_Our solutions and services, including solutions obtained through acquisitions, could infringe third-party_**
**_intellectual property rights, which could result in material litigation costs and limit our ability to use certain_**
**_technologies in the future._**

Third parties, employees or collaborators may claim that certain of our products infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We have been subject to patent infringement claims and may in
the future be subject to an increased number of intellectual property claims, including claims alleging the


-----

unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in our solutions. We may also be subject to ownership or inventorship
disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants, contractors or others who are
involved in developing our intellectual property. Although it is our policy to require our employees and contractors
who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning
such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in
fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. If we fail in defending any such claims,
in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive
ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property, or be required to pay royalties for access to such intellectual
property rights (which may not be commercially reasonable). Other owners may also be able to license such rights to
other third parties, including our competitors. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in
substantial costs and be a distraction to management.

In addition, our use of open source software components in our products may make us vulnerable to claims
that our products infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property rights, in particular
because many of the open source software components we may incorporate with our products may be developed by
numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. An increase in intellectual property
claims may occur for a variety of reasons, including:

    - the expansion of our product lines through product development and acquisitions;

    - the volume of patent infringement litigation commenced by non-practicing entities;

    - an increase in the number of competitors in our industry segments and the resulting increase in the
number of related solutions and services and the overlap in the functionality of those solutions and
services;

    - an increase in the number of our competitors and third parties that use their own intellectual property
rights to limit our freedom to operate and exploit our solutions, or to otherwise block us from taking
full advantage of our markets;

    - our reliance on the technology of others and, therefore, the requirement to obtain intellectual property
licenses from third parties in order for us to commercialize our solutions or services, which licenses we
may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain from these third parties on reasonable terms; and

    - the unauthorized or improperly licensed use of third-party code in our solutions.

Further, responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity or merit, could result in costly
litigation, cause product shipment delays and divert our management’s attention away from running our business.
Intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following:

    - pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties
for past periods) to the party claiming infringement;

    - cease selling solutions or services that use the challenged intellectual property;

    - obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property to sell or use the relevant
technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

    - redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or not be
accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition
may be adversely impacted.


-----

Our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of our customers for intellectual
property infringement claims. Further, particularly because patent applications in the United States and many other
countries are not publicly disclosed at the time of filing, applications covering technology used in our software
products may have been filed without our knowledge. If we were to discover that our products infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, we would have to obtain licenses
from these parties, which could require the payment of royalty or licensing fees, in order to continue offering our
products without substantial re-engineering. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable
terms or at all, and if we could not obtain such licenses, we might not be able to re-engineer our products
successfully or in a timely fashion. If we fail to address any infringement, misappropriation or violation issues
successfully, we could be forced to incur significant costs, including damages and potentially satisfying
indemnification obligations that we have to our customers, and we could be prevented from selling certain of our
products.

**_Our use of “open source” software could negatively impact our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to_**
**_possible litigation._**

The solutions or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called “open
source” software, and we may incorporate open source software into other solutions in the future. Such open source
software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example,
the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Apache License (version 2), “BSDstyle” licenses, “MIT-style” licenses and other open source licenses which permit the user to copy, modify and
distribute the software, typically free of charge. Certain open source software is licensed pursuant to license
agreements that require a party who distributes the open source software as a component of the party’s software to
publicly disclose part or all of the source code to the party’s software. This effectively renders what was previously
proprietary software open source software. Even though we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an
effort to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, including ensuring no open source software is
used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, such use could inadvertently
occur and it is possible that not all instances of our open source code usage are properly reviewed. Additionally,
software purchased through the supply chain may contain open source software of which we are unaware that could
present license rights and/or security risk. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations
under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use such that we have not triggered any of
these conditions, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation or enforcement of many of the
terms of these types of licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to allege
that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur
significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be
subject to significant damages, enjoined from the distribution of our solutions that contained open source software,
and required to comply with the terms of the applicable license, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of
some of our solutions. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in an
unintended manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to publicly release the source code of our
proprietary software, offer our solutions that use the open source software for no cost, make available source code
for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and/or
license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license.

In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks
than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide technology support,
maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software. Open source software may
also present risks of unforeseen or unmanaged security vulnerabilities that could potentially unintentionally be
introduced into our solutions.

**_If we lose access to third-party licenses, releases of our solutions could be delayed._**

We believe that we will continue to rely, in part, on third-party licenses to enhance and differentiate our
solutions. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

    - undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person’s code in the third party’s software;


-----

    - disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable and
indemnification protection;

    - infringement actions brought by third-parties;

    - the creation of solutions by third parties that directly compete with our solutions; and

    - termination or expiration of the license.

If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software
obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of our solutions. Any delays could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business depends on maintaining and protecting the strength of our collection of brands._**

The Citrix, NetScaler, TIBCO and other brands that we have developed have significantly contributed to
the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of customers
and partners. We may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or
confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same
level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and services. Also, others may rely on false comparative advertising
and customers or potential customers could be influenced by false advertising. Additionally, we may be unable to
use some of our brands in certain countries or unable to secure trademark rights in certain jurisdictions where we do
business. In order to police, maintain, enhance and protect our brands, we may be required to make substantial
investments that may not be successful. We may also be subject to potential trade name or trademark infringement
or dilution claims brought against us by owners of other trademarks. If we fail to police, maintain, enhance and
protect our brands, if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused
by others’ trademarks, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely
affected.

**Risks Related to our Liquidity, Taxation and Capital Return**

**_Our portfolios of liquid securities and other investments may lose value or become impaired._**

Our investment portfolio consists of agency securities, corporate securities, money market funds, and
government securities. Although we follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk
associated with investments by investing primarily in investment grade, highly liquid securities and by limiting
exposure to any one issuer depending on credit quality, we cannot give assurances that the assets in our investment
portfolio will not lose value, become impaired, or suffer from illiquidity.

**_Any losses we incur as a result of our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and partners could harm our_**
**_results of operations._**

We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting credit arrangements, seek to limit credit to
amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for
doubtful accounts. As we have grown our revenue and customer base, our exposure to credit risk has increased. Any
material losses we incur as a result of customer defaults could have an adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

**_We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could_**
**_adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign
jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of
our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the geographic mix of our revenue, or by changes in tax laws or their
interpretation. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, our


-----

intercompany transfer pricing allocations and other tax liabilities. Any change in the geographical allocation of our
business could adversely affect our tax rates to the extent the shift is weighted towards jurisdictions with higher tax
rates.

Pillar Two of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Global Tax Deal establishes
a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% applied to cross-border profits of large multinational corporations. The
OEDC expects countries to implement components of Pillar Two starting in 2024, although jurisdictions may
establish a safe harbor delaying implementation a number of years. Additionally, there may also be future guidance
and interpretation from the IRS, the SEC, the FASB and various other tax jurisdictions that affect our results of
operations and financial condition. The tax impact from any of these provisions may have a material effect on our
U.S. taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and situations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our income tax returns are routinely subject to audits by tax authorities
and those authorities may disagree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Although we regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine our estimates of uncertain tax
positions, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition. A final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could have
an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and
goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax
authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities
which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material and adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many countries in the EU, and other countries where we do
business, are actively considering or have enacted changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations
and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, which may have an adverse
effect on our business or on our results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction,
including the U.S., may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to
successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material and
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**General Risks**

**_We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our future_**
**_operating results._**

Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates, which could adversely affect our
future revenue and overall operating results. For example, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign
currencies would result in lower revenues from our international sales when sales are translated into U.S. dollars,
although these decreases may be partially offset by lower operating expenses. Additionally, customers in foreign
countries that incur higher costs due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar may elect to delay payments or default
on credit extended to them. Any material delay or default in our collection of significant accounts could have a
negative effect on our results of operations. Further, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar could require us to offer
discounts, reduce pricing or offer other incentives to mitigate any negative effects on demand from such a rise in the
U.S. dollar. In the event that the U.S. dollar weakens compared to foreign currencies, we may incur higher operating
expenses in those locations and, therefore, our business, financial condition and operating results could be
negatively affected. As our international operations continue to grow, or if large fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates continue, our revenue, operating expenses and income may be adversely affected.

In order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency
relative to the U.S. dollar, we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as we deem


-----

appropriate for a portion of our expenses, which are denominated in the local currency of our foreign subsidiaries.
We generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency
expenses for those currencies to which we have the greatest exposure. When the dollar is weak, foreign currency
denominated expenses will be higher, and these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gains realized from
our hedging contracts. If the dollar is strong, foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower. These lower
expenses will in turn be partially offset by the losses incurred from our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there
will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk
and there is no guarantee that we will accurately forecast the expenses we are hedging, and our hedging program
may not reduce the impact of short-term or long-term volatility in foreign exchange rates. Further, a substantial
portion of our overseas assets and liabilities are denominated in local currencies. To protect against fluctuations in
earnings caused by changes in currency exchange rates when remeasuring our balance sheet, we utilize foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to this potential volatility. Our foreign currency forward contracts
are intended to reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For example, we do
not execute forward contracts in all currencies in which we conduct business. There is no assurance that our hedging
strategies will be effective. In addition, as a result of entering into these contracts with counterparties who are
unrelated to us, the risk of a counterparty default exists in fulfilling the hedge contract. Should there be a
counterparty default, we could be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions.

**_We are involved in litigation, investigations and regulatory inquiries and proceedings that could negatively affect_**
**_us._**

From time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims,
demands and investigations relating to our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product
liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, corruption, breach of contract, labor
and employment, wage and hour, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the
ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have discussions with government entities regarding
the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations and employment and benefits related
compliance. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings. See “Note 13—Legal Proceedings” to our
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for additional information. Any
of these matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant
expenses and lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims. Allegations made in the course of
regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims.
Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our
business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or
more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations.

**_Changes or modifications in financial accounting standards may have a material adverse impact on our reported_**
**_results of operations or financial condition._**

A change or modification in existing accounting rules or policies can have a significant effect on our
reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New
pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may
occur in the future. Changes to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to
changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could materially adversely affect our reported financial
results or the way we conduct our business. A change in existing financial accounting standards or practices may
even retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions.

**_Natural disasters, climate-related impacts, or other unanticipated catastrophes that result in a disruption of our_**
**_operations could negatively impact our results of operations._**

Our worldwide operations are dependent on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems and
website. Significant portions of our computer equipment, intellectual property resources and personnel, including
critical resources dedicated to research and development and administrative support functions are presently located
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an area of the country that is particularly prone to hurricanes, and at our various
locations in California, an area of the country that is particularly prone to earthquakes and wildfires. We also have
operations in various domestic and international locations that expose us to additional diverse risks. The occurrence


-----

of natural disasters, such as extreme weather, hurricanes, floods or earthquakes; pandemics and global public health
threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; or other unanticipated catastrophes, such as telecommunications failures,
cyberattacks, fires or terrorist attacks, at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers and
customers do business, could cause interruptions in our operations. For example, hurricanes have passed through
southern Florida causing extensive damage to the region. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster
response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and
could decrease demand for our services. In addition, even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large
disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other casualty events could have a significant impact on our partners’,
suppliers’ and customers’ businesses, which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.
Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, or our partners’, suppliers’ or customers’ businesses, due to
natural disasters, pandemics or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations_
_together with the section entitled “Risk Factors” and with Cloud Software’s consolidated financial statements and_
_the related notes included elsewhere in this offering circular. The following discussion and analysis of our financial_
_condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks, uncertainties_
_and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note_
_Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-_
_looking statement._

**Overview**

CSG Holdings is a Delaware corporation that is the sole shareholder of Cloud Software. CSG Holdings has
no significant assets or operations other than the ownership of Cloud Software. CSG Holdings is owned by Holdco,
a Delaware corporation. The common stock of Holdco is owned by certain affiliates of the Investors, and the Series
A Preferred Stock of Holdco is held by certain other investors. CSG Holdings (i) has no liabilities other than those
incidental to its ownership of the equity interests in Cloud Software, and (ii) has no assets other than its ownership
of all of the equity interests of Cloud Software. As a result, there are no material differences between the historical
financial data of CSG Holdings and the historical financial data relating to Cloud Software. Shareholders of CSG
Holdings (“CSG Shareholders”) shall not have any personal liability whatsoever in such CSG Shareholders’
capacity as a shareholder, whether to CSG Holdings, to the creditors of CSG Holdings or to any other third party, for
the debts, liabilities, commitments or any other obligations of CSG Holdings or for any losses of CSG Holdings.

Prior to the Merger, a new organization structure was implemented. Intermediate Holdings, a Delaware
limited liability company, was the sole shareholder of Cloud Software and previous reporting entity for the group.
Intermediate Holdings had no significant assets or operations other than the ownership of Cloud Software.
Intermediate Holdings was owned by Balboa Holdings, a Delaware limited partnership that was owned by certain
affiliates of Vista. Intermediate Holdings (i) had no liabilities other than those incidental to its ownership of the
equity interests in Cloud Software, and (ii) had no assets other than its ownership of all of the equity interests of
Cloud Software. Intermediate Holdings distributed their ownership shares of Cloud Software to Balboa Holdings.

On January 28, 2022, Holdco and CSG Holdings were formed under Balboa Holdings. Cloud Software
contemporaneously formed Parent. Parent then formed Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation. The aforementioned
entities were formed for the sole purpose of consummating the Merger.

On September 30, 2022, the Merger and related transactions were executed, with CSG Holdings becoming
the sole shareholder of Cloud Software and its subsidiaries, which include Parent, the sole shareholder of Citrix. As
a result of the reorganization, CSG Holdings became the successor reporting entity from Intermediate Holdings.
References to the “Company,” “us,” “we” or “our” in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” refer to the consolidated operations of CSG Holdings and its subsidiaries.

Cloud Software was created by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading global enterprisefocused software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of companies under the management of Cloud
Software, collectively one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing comprehensive, secure
and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our mission is to create long-term
financial value by building a diversified software company that develops, sells and supports mission-critical
products that serve the largest enterprises globally.

**_Inflation and Price Volatility in the Global Economy_**

General inflation in the United States, Europe and other geographies remains high. General inflation has led
to currency volatility, rising interest rates and wages, and fiscal and policy interventions by governments in reaction
to such events, which could have negative impacts on our business by decreasing the capital available to our
customers to purchase our goods and services and increasing our operating costs and costs to borrow.


-----

**_Transition to Subscription Model_**

As our business continues to transition from perpetual licenses to a subscription-based model, customer
demand, contract value and the term of subscription contracts have become the most critical factors to our results of
operations. Subscription contracts tend to have a lower annualized contract value than license contracts, but are
recurring in nature, which is expected to provide a steadier stream of revenue.

**_Seasonality and Quarterly Order Flow_**

Our business is subject to variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors in the United States and
worldwide. These factors include fewer selling days during the summer vacation season, the impact of the
December holidays, and a slowdown in capital expenditures by our customers after calendar year-end (during our
first fiscal quarter). These factors typically constrain sales activity in our first and third fiscal quarters compared to
the rest of the year, and they make quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.

Additionally, a substantial portion of our product orders are usually received in the last month of each fiscal
quarter, with a concentration of such orders in the final two weeks of the quarter. We typically ship products shortly
after the receipt of an order and may have orders that have not shipped at the end of any given quarter. Because the
amount of such product orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a particular quarter is not a
reliable indicator to predict our future performance.

**Results of Operations**

The following tables set forth the consolidated statements of operations in dollar amounts and as a
percentage of our total revenue for the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparison of results is not
necessarily indicative of results for future periods.

**_Comparison of Three Months Ended February 28, 2024 to 2023_**

_Total Revenue_

Our total revenue consisted primarily of license, subscription, maintenance and consulting services fees
from our customers, distributors and partners.

**Three Months Ended February 28,**

**2024** **2023** **Percentage Change**
Total revenue ................................... $ 1,432,909 $ 1,139,660 26%

Total revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2024 increased by $293.2 million, or 26%,
compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The increase was comprised of a $488.2 million increase in software
revenue, offset by a $194.9 million decrease in maintenance and service revenue. The overall increase was due to
the continued shift to subscription revenue and an increase in longer term contracts closed during the three months
ended February 28, 2024.

For the three months ended February 28, 2024, as a percentage of total revenue and compared to the same
quarter in the prior year, we experienced a significant increase in the United States region and slight decreases in the
Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, the Asia Pacific and Japan region, and the Other Americas region.

Revenue by regions is as follows:

**Three Months Ended February 28,**
**2024** **2023**
United States .............................................................................................. $ 822,411 $ 536,578
Percentage of total revenue ................................................................. 57% 47%
Europe, Middle East and Africa ................................................................ 450,648 410,600
Percentage of total revenue ................................................................. 31% 36%

_Software Revenue and Cost_

**Three Months Ended**
**February 28,** **Percentage**
**2024** **2023** **Change**
Software revenue .............................................................................. $ 1,223,442 $ 735,282 66%
Percentage of total revenue ....................................................... 85% 65%
Cost of software revenue .................................................................. $ 367,656 $ 391,040 (6)%
Percentage of total revenue ....................................................... 26% 34%
Percentage of software revenue ................................................ 30% 53%

Software revenue is comprised of both license and subscription revenue. Software revenue increased by
$488.2 million, or 66%, for the three months ended February 28, 2024 compared to the same quarter in the previous
year. The overall increase was primarily due to a $517.2 million increase in subscription revenue due to our
continued transition to the subscription model, introduction of new Universal Platform licenses and an increase in
longer term contracts, offset by a $29.0 million decrease in license revenue primarily due to our transition away
from the perpetual license model to the subscription model.

Cost of software revenue mainly consists of amortization of developed technology and royalty costs. Cost
of software revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2024 decreased by $23.4 million, or 6%, compared to
the same period in the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to fewer hardware sales during the three
months ended February 28, 2024 compared to same quarter in the prior year.

_Maintenance and Service Revenue and Cost_

**Year Ended**
**November 30,** **Percentage**
**2024** **2023** **Change**

Cost of maintenance and service revenue ......................................... $ 71,398 $ 99,538 (28)%
Percentage of total revenue ....................................................... 5% 9%
Percentage of maintenance and service revenue ....................... 34% 25%

Maintenance and service revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2024 decreased by $194.9
million, or 48%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $177.6 million
decrease in maintenance revenue due to the continued shift to subscription license model and a $17.3 million
decrease in service revenue primarily due to a reduced number of software implementation arrangements entered
into with our customers.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue consisted primarily of compensation for support and services,
customer support personnel and third-party contractors and associated expenses related to providing consulting
services.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2024 decreased by $28.1
million, or 28%, compared to the same period in the previous year. The decrease for the three months ended
February 28, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of $26.3 million in salaries and employee-related costs due to
decreased headcount, a $2.7 million decrease in facilities and a $1.9 million decrease in corporate allocations, offset
by $2.2 million increase related to consulting fees and contractor costs.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2024 decreased by $31.5
million, or 17%, compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to a $19.9
million decrease in salaries and employee-related costs due to a reduction in headcount, a $7.8 million decrease in
consulting and contractor costs, a $8.1 million decrease in facilities and facilities allocation and a $4.0 million
decrease in corporate allocations, offset by an increase in software fees of $6.9 million.

consulting and contractor costs and a $3.4 million decrease in software subscriptions fees and hosting costs, offset
by a $10.2 million increase in corporate allocations and a $3.5 million increase in facilities costs.

_Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets_

Intangible assets acquired through corporate acquisitions are comprised of the expected value of developed
technologies, patents, trademarks, established customer bases and non-compete agreements, as well as maintenance
contracts. Amortization of developed technologies is recorded as a cost of revenue, and amortization of other
acquired intangible assets is included in operating expenses.

employees of the acquired company that are terminated within 90 days of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related
and other costs decreased by $77.8 million, or 86%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increased Merger
expenses in the prior year. Acquisition-related and other costs increased by $60.7 million, or 206%, in fiscal 2022

offset by the interest rate swap. Interest expense increased by $173.0 million, or 119%, in fiscal 2022 from fiscal
2021. The increase was primarily due to the interest related to debt incurred under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the credit agreement governing the second lien bridge term loan facility entered into by the Company in
connection with the Merger, the First Lien Notes and the Rollover Citrix Notes that we incurred or issued in
connection with the Merger.

of investments, partially offset by a $16.8 million increase in interest income. Other expense, net, increased by $13.3
million, or 396%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to foreign exchange losses of approximately

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is lower than fiscal 2022. See “Note 17 – Income Taxes” to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for further details.


-----

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is lower than fiscal 2021. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due
to the effects of the prior year ibi integration and the current year release of valuation allowance on deferred tax
assets of the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation and foreign tax credits as a result of the significant deferred
tax liabilities acquired through the Merger.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Capital Resources_**

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our access to our Revolving
Facility while our principal liquidity requirements are funding our operating expenses and related capital
expenditures. We intend to fund our operating expenses primarily through cash flows from operations. We believe
that our current cash, cash equivalents and amounts available under our Revolving Facility together with expected
cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and
capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. Should demand for our products and services significantly
decline over the next twelve months, the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted.

Our affiliates may purchase our debt from time to time through open market purchases or other
transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in
accordance with the terms of the debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our consolidated
financial statements.

**_Current Cash Flows_**

_Analysis of the Cash Flow Changes as of and for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2024_

As of February 28, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaling $708.5 million,
representing an increase of $267.7 million from November 30, 2023. As of February 28, 2024, $287.9 million of our
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. In the event cash from foreign
operations held by our foreign subsidiaries is needed to fund operations in the United States, we may be subject to
additional income taxes in the United States reduced by any foreign taxes paid on such foreign earnings.

Net cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended February 28, 2024 was $364.7 million,
resulting from $449.8 million in non-cash charges and an $38.8 million net change in assets and liabilities, offset by
a net loss of $46.3 million. The non-cash charges primarily included amortization of intangible assets, depreciation,
debt discount and issuance costs, deferred income taxes and stock compensation. Net change in assets and liabilities
for the three months ended February 28, 2024 consisted primarily of an increase in accounts receivable, prepaid
expenses and other assets, unearned revenue, and accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities, offset by a
decrease in accounts payable.

To the extent that non-cash items increase or decrease our future operating results, there will be no
corresponding impact on our cash flows. After excluding the effects of these non-cash charges, the primary changes
in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating
cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers, including maintenance that is typically
invoiced annually in advance. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors
for accounts payable and other liabilities. We generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the agreements governing such services.

Net cash used in investing activities was $9.6 million for the three months ended February 28, 2024,
primarily as a result of our acquisition of Vast Limits and purchases of fixed assets.

Net cash used in financing activities was $86.8 million for the three months ended February 28, 2024,
resulting primarily from principal debt repayments of $21.0 million and $65.9 million primarily used to pay
dividends to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in Holdco.

equivalents and restricted cash were held by our foreign subsidiaries.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was $90.4 million, resulting from a net loss of
$1,246.0 million, adjusted for $1,879.8 million in non-cash charges, and offset by a $543.4 million net decrease in
assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and debt
discount, deferred income tax, stock-based compensation, remeasurement loss on a foreign currency denominated
loan, and loss on extinguishment of debt. Net change in assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in
accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and other long-term liabilities and unearned revenue.

Net cash used in investing activities was $7.8 million in fiscal 2023, resulting primarily from purchases of
property and equipment $12.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of a building for $4.5
million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $361.1 million in fiscal 2023, resulting primarily from $4,109.0
million used in the extinguishment of debt, $1,197.5 million used to pay dividends to holders of Holdco, and $57.8
million used for regular debt principal repayments, largely offset by $5,003.2 million in proceeds received from the
new debt issued. See “Note 9 – Debt and Credit Facilities” to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering circular for additional information.

_Analysis of the Cash Flow Changes for Fiscal 2022_

As of November 30, 2022, we had cash and restricted cash totaling $716.8 million, representing an increase
of $566.6 million from November 30, 2021. As of November 30, 2022, $345.5 million of our cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash were held by our foreign subsidiaries.

$362.0 million, adjusted for $431.3 million in non-cash charges, and a $25.8 million net change in assets and
liabilities. The non-cash charges included depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax, stock-based
compensation, debt extinguishment loss, and foreign currency exchange rate loss.

Net cash used in investing activities was $14,199.6 million in fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from
$14,262.0 million paid in connection with the Merger, net of cash acquired, the settlement of a loan to a related
party of $75.0 million in connection with a potential merger that was under consideration at the time but not
consummated, and purchases of property and equipment of $12.8 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $14,675.2 million in fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from
$14,273.2 million in proceeds received from the new debt issued, and $3,566.0 million from a contribution from
Holdco, offset by $3,085.3 million resulting from the debt extinguishment. See “Note 9 – Debt and Credit Facilities”
to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for additional
information.

**_Guarantee Credit Line_**

Issued bank guarantees were approximately $3.7 million, $3.6 million and $5.4 million as of February 28,
2024, November 30, 2023 and November 30, 2022, respectively, and are collateralized by pledging the equivalent
amount under restricted cash as required under a guarantee credit line. Various other contractual commitments also
require us to issue letters of credit and pledge cash as security and record this cash under restricted cash. As of
February 28, 2024, November 30, 2023 and November 30, 2022, we had restricted cash of $13.3 million, $13.7
million and $15.2 million, respectively, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We conduct business in the Americas, EMEA and APJ. As a result, our financial results could be affected
by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in economic conditions in foreign markets.
While the majority of our transactions are currently made in U.S. dollars, we transact business in over 30 foreign
currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to our operations are the Euro, Indian Rupee and British
Pound.We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage our currency exposure related to cash,
accounts receivable, and certain net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and these
forward contracts are generally settled within ninety days from trade dates. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.

We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our
foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the
conversion of the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to translation gains or losses,
which are recorded net as a component of other comprehensive income.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We maintain our cash only in current and savings accounts and are not considered to be subject to interest
rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest paid on our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

Cloud Software was created by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading global enterprisefocused software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of companies under the management of Cloud
Software, collectively one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing comprehensive, secure
and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our mission is to create long-term
financial value by building a diversified software company that develops, sells and supports mission-critical
products that serve the largest enterprises globally.

Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Krause, our strategy is to focus on high-quality, sustainable ARR
while driving industry leading EBITDA. We achieve those results by:

      - maintaining a rigorous and disciplined approach to investment;

      - critical examination of our products to determine core value propositions;

      - investment to deliver highly innovative and competitive solutions to our customers;

      - a focus on renewals and expansion within our existing customer base;

      - divestiture of assets that are not conducive to long-term favorable results in our model; and

      - highly efficient and scalable corporate functions that support our businesses.

We build or buy technology to enhance our businesses’ core products. We anticipate acquiring additional
businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to customers and are good fits to operate
within our model.

The Company goes to market under seven portfolio Company brands: Citrix, NetScaler (as a brand of
Citrix), TIBCO, ibi (as a brand of TIBCO), ShareFile, NetScaler eCommerce, Spotfire, Jaspersoft, and XenServer.

We have coalesced our strategy around these brands to:

       - allow focus by those brands on core value propositions with increased innovation investment;

       - create significant cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies;

       - drive accountability in each business; and

       - leverage increased cash flow to allow debt repayment and future acquisitions.

Collectively, Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO represent about 87% of Cloud Software’s ARR for the twelve
months ended February 28, 2024.

**Portfolio of Brands**

**_Citrix_**

Citrix is a leading provider of infrastructure for secure hybrid work through virtual desktop infrastructure
(“VDI”) and desktop-as-a-service (“DaaS”) with global software development teams and core technologies that
represent a differentiated solution for customers. According to IDC, Citrix is a leader in the Virtual Client
Computing (“VCC”) market. Citrix customers include some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world


-----

and span major industry verticals, including healthcare, financial services, technology, manufacturing, consumer and
government agencies. Citrix has long-standing relationships with its customers with an average 10 years of tenure.

Citrix supports today’s remote and hybrid work environment with a broad range of features and
functionalities that tie together the myriad of applications that reside within enterprises. Citrix provides secure
access to employees, helps minimize distractions and improve focus, enabling them to do their best work, elevating
employee productivity and employee engagement, and improving an enterprise’s security profile. Further, Citrix
delivers a unified and secure offering with single sign-on access to all the applications and content employees use in
one unified platform. For administrators, Citrix enables proactive management of security threats in complex,
distributed, hybrid, multi-cloud and multi-device environments, and it empowers administrators to deliver
applications to end users more securely than operating them natively.

Citrix, through its brand NetScaler, has a long history as the application delivery controller of choice for
Fortune 500 companies who rely on it for both employee-facing and customer-facing applications. Today, NetScaler
is a line of networking technology, which includes application delivery, applications insights, and application security

- to help enterprises efficiently consolidate their application delivery and security infrastructure.

In March 2024, Citrix announced a new platform licensing program and evolved its universal subscription
licensing. The new licensing programs bring the suite of Citrix capabilities, including VDI, DaaS, ADC, Zero Trust,
Observability and others, together in a single license. For customers, these changes:

  - consolidate and optimize costs;

  - protect business-critical applications and data;

  - reduce operational complexity; and

  - improve user experience.

Effectively, the unified licensing model gives customers entitlements to all capabilities, delivering greater
value. For Citrix, the new licensing programs simplify our sale process by consolidating the suite of capabilities
into a single license, and our back-end operations by reducing the number of SKUs we manage.

Citrix goes to market directly and through partners, depending on customer ARR. Our largest customers
have assigned account executives and often receive support from large systems integrators partnered with Citrix.
Customers below a certain ARR level are serviced by resellers and distributors.  Sales to all customer tiers are
outsourced to partners in the three following regions: Latin America (excluding Brazil), ASEAN and emerging
markets (Middle East and Africa).

Meaningful Citrix competitors include certain offerings from VMWare’s EUC division recently acquired
by KKR, Microsoft, AWS, F5, Radware, A10 and Cisco.

_Technology Relationships_

Citrix’s most important technology relationship is with Microsoft, a relationship that has for over 30 years
spanned product development, GTM initiatives and channel partner development. This has provided mutual customers
secure, high-performance delivery of applications, desktops and data to their employees. In April 2024, Citrix and
Microsoft extended its strategic partnership for an additional eight years. The renewed strategic partnership includes
a focus on the development of new cloud and AI solutions with an integrated Citrix / Microsoft product roadmap,
allowing Citrix the opportunity to enhance the value of Citrix software as well as contribute to Microsoft AVD.
Specifically, Citrix will be the preferred Microsoft Global Azure Partner solution for Enterprise Desktop-as-a-Service
when collaborating with joint Azure customers.

**_TIBCO_**


-----

TIBCO is a global leader in enterprise data management, with an integrated business intelligence and
analytics platform that utilizes high-end enterprise application integration and master data management (“MDM”).
TIBCO provides critical data integration components in a company’s operating infrastructure, covering a variety of
durable industry verticals. Further, TIBCO offers a control plane that provides observation across all data planes,
including on-premises, management of deployments and scaling, and monitoring of runtime performance metrics.

TIBCO offers the high performance, throughput, reliability, and scalability demanded by mission critical
operations. Like Citrix, TIBCO recently enhanced its licensing model by offering a new platform license. The
platform license provides the additional value of:

  - gaining visibility over all TIBCO solutions wherever they exist within the customer environment;

  - accelerating development of new, innovative applications and digital services;

  - dramatically reducing time to identify runtime and performance problems;

  - easy deployment and scaling of TIBCO solutions to cloud platforms of choice; and

  - measuring and optimizing the costs and business value of TIBCO solutions.

ibi is a brand of TIBCO and provides scalable data and analytics software that makes data easy to access
and analytics easy to consume. It is a business intelligence and full stack data management solution providing
business-ready data. ibi, previously known as Information Builders, was acquired by TIBCO in 2021.

Meaningful TIBCO competitors include certain offerings from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and against pure play
companies in select areas, including MuleSoft and Boomi (integration), Denoda and Informatica (data management),
Qlik, Tableau and SAS (analytics).

**Other brands under Cloud Software include:**

**_ShareFile_**     - ShareFile is a secure content collaboration, file sharing and sync software that supports all the
document-centric tasks and workflow needs of small to large businesses, including electronic signature. ShareFile
also offers cloud-based or on-premises storage, virtual data rooms and client portals. We are currently exploring
strategic alternatives with respect to ShareFile, which may include a sale of all or part of ShareFile. There is no
assurance that any transaction will be completed, or if any transaction is completed, the timing or terms of any such
transaction. We may determine to suspend or terminate the exploration of strategic alternatives, including a potential
sale of ShareFile, at any time due to various factors.

**_NetScaler e-Commerce – NetScaler e-Commerce leverages NetScaler’s original purpose of providing load_**
balancing and ensuring website performance and availability. It is focused on customers with e-commerce websites,
such as online retail and marketplaces, digital products and services, SaaS, IaaS, online gaming and gambling. This
is in contrast to the NetScaler capabilities within Citrix, which are focused on enterprise application delivery,
security and observability.

**_Spotfire – Spotfire offers a single visual analytics platform for data exploration and real-time decisions._**
Backed by point-and-click, no-code data science, Spotfire empowers non-technical personnel to analyze both data-atrest and data-in-motion, together, for faster insight.

**_Jaspersoft - Jaspersoft provides timely, actionable data inside of applications and business processes through_**
an embeddable, cost-effective reporting and analytics platform.

**_XenServer - XenServer is an industry leading platform for cost-effective desktop, server, and cloud_**
virtualization infrastructures. XenServer enables organizations of any size or type to consolidate and transform
compute resources into virtual workloads for today’s data center requirements.


-----

**Corporate Functions**

Our portfolio of brands are supported by corporate shared services for scalability, cost efficiencies and skills.
These include:

  - _Finance - focused on cash flow, accounting, budgeting and reporting, financial reporting, audits, taxation,_
risk management and treasury.

  - _Operations – focused on:_

     - _Infrastructure & Digital Workspace - providing employees with the physical equipment and digital_
ecosystem to keep them connected and productive. Non-core elements of IT operations are
transitioning to outsourced models for greater scale.

     - _Business Process Management - develops and performs the operational tasks to support the entire_
customer lifecycle (sales order processing and customer service), as well as critical internal
operations (procurement, automation and SaaS management). Non-core elements of this function are
transitioning to outsourced models for greater scale.

     - _Software business operations - drives efficiencies across the brands by providing standard_
engineering tools, leading consistent methodology adoption, creating product documentation, and
managing cloud financial operations.

     - _Cyber security - protects the organization by implementing policies, controls, scanning, and patches_
across the IT and product systems.

  - _Corporate marketing - providing governance and common services for the corporate entity as well as the_
portfolio of brands.

  - _Human resources - focused on talent management, compensation and employee benefits, training and_
development, and compliance.

  - _Legal - focused on all internal and external legal matters including governance, entity management and_
rationalization, litigation, investigations, compliance, mergers and acquisitions, divestures, employee and
employer law, privacy and intellectual property and complex commercial transactions.

  - _Facilities - ensuring value of return for facilities, maintenance of facilities and providing for physical_
security of facilities and employees.

Due to the highly specialized requirements of each brand, certain functions are solely controlled and managed
by each brand. This includes engineering, product management and product marketing, and customer support. Further,
with the exception of ibi and XenServer, each brand maintains its own sales force. XenServer solutions are sold by
Citrix sales, and ibi solutions are sold by TIBCO sales.

Due to the significant differences in customer profiles for ShareFile and Jaspersoft, these two brands are more
stand-alone than the other brands. As such, they not only maintain their own sales organizations, but have full
responsibility for marketing and separate professional services.

**Our People**

As of February 28, 2024, we had 7,795 employees.

**Our Technology and Intellectual Property**


-----

Cloud Software’s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology. We believe that factors such
as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, product enhancements, and new product developments are
all essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common
law rights in the United States and similar rights in other countries, as well as on contractual measures. In order to
limit access to and disclosure and use of confidential information and proprietary technology, our portfolio of brands
enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors; into
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties; and into confidentiality and/or license
agreements with distributors and customers. In addition to these contractual measures, the Company also relies on a
combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect the
brand and other intellectual property. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and while steps are taken to
protect and preserve trade secrets, including maintaining security of on-site premises and physical and electronic
security of information technology systems, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies
for any such breach.

The Company has a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative
aspects of its products, services, and technologies where appropriate. As of May 1, 2024, the Company owns
approximately 2,500 U.S. granted patents and 250 U.S. pending patent applications. In foreign jurisdictions, including
Australia, Canada, China, the EU, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,
Singapore, South Korea and the United Kingdom, the Company owns approximately 1,300 granted patents and 150
pending patent applications.

Further, Cloud Software and its portfolio of brands actively pursue additional registrations of trademarks,
logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other foreign jurisdictions in which it operates.

Despite these measures, we may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights,
and/or defend against allegations by third parties that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their
intellectual property rights. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to our protection of
intellectual property and other proprietary information, please see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual
Property and Brand Recognition.”

**_Bali Finco, Inc._**

On November 24, 2021, Bali Finco Inc. (“Finco”), an investment vehicle owned by funds managed by
Vista and formed in connection with a proposed acquisition, issued a promissory note for $75.0 million to
Intermediate Holdings in exchange for cash. The promissory note bore interest at a rate of 0.22% per annum and was
expected to mature on November 24, 2023. On December 13, 2021, Finco repaid the promissory note in full as the
proposed acquisition was not consummated. Intermediate Holdings determined Finco to be a variable interest entity,
and that it is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity and therefore does not consolidate Finco
because it does not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance.
Intermediate Holdings had no liabilities to Finco as of November 30, 2023.

In connection with the proposed but discontinued acquisition, at Vista’s request, Intermediate Holdings
incurred expenses of approximately $29.8 million towards the settlement of forward contracts and the release of
associated debt commitments previously contracted by Finco related to its proposed acquisition in December 2021.
These amounts were recorded as “Acquisition related and other costs” in Cloud Software’s condensed consolidated
statement of operations for fiscal 2022. Finco was dissolved on September 21, 2022.

**Procedures with Respect to Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions; Corporate Opportunities**

From time to time, we may do business with certain companies affiliated with the Investors. The board of
directors of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (the “Governing Boards”) will not adopt a formal written policy for the
review and approval of transactions with related persons. However, the Governing Boards will review and approve
transactions with related persons as appropriate.

Under the Holdco Stockholders Agreement, the Investors have consent rights over related person
transactions between Holdco and its stockholders or affiliates of its stockholders, subject to certain conditions. In
addition, under the Holdco Stockholders Agreement, Holdco renounced, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the Investors and each

**First Lien Notes**

To finance the Merger and related transactions, on September 30, 2022, the Issuer issued $4,000.0 million
aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029 (the “First Lien Notes”) pursuant to an indenture, dated
as of September 30, 2022 (the “First Lien Notes Indenture”). The First Lien Notes will mature on March 31, 2029.

twelve-month period commencing on September 30, 2022 at a redemption price of 103% of the aggregate principal

secured second lien notes due 2029 (the “Second Lien Notes”) pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 10, 2023
(the “Second Lien Notes Indenture”). The proceeds were used to repay all of the loans outstanding under the second
lien bridge term loan facility entered into by the Company in connection with the Merger, including any accrued and
unpaid interest thereon. The Second Lien Notes will mature on September 30, 2029.

Elliott purchased approximately $550 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes.

The Issuer pays interest on the Second Lien Notes at 9.00% per annum, semi-annually in cash in arrears on
March 31 and September 30 of each year.

The Second Lien Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Issuer’s existing
and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that are borrowers, or guarantee the Issuer’s obligations, under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. The Second Lien Notes are secured by second-priority liens on the Collateral, which
consists of substantially all of the assets that secure the Issuer’s and guarantors’ obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. See “—Senior Secured Credit Facilities—Guarantees and Security.”

The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Second Lien Notes at any time on or after September 30, 2025 at
the redemption prices set forth in the Second Lien Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem up to 40% of the Second Lien Notes using the proceeds

(ix) agree to certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to the Issuer. Additionally,
upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the
Second Lien Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Second Lien Notes Indenture also contains customary
events of default.

**Citrix’s Senior Secured Notes**

As of February 28, 2024, Citrix had outstanding approximately $112.4 million aggregate principal amount
of its 2.500% senior notes due 2027 (the “Rollover Citrix Notes”), which were issued pursuant to the base indenture,
dated as of November 15, 2017, as supplemented and amended by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of


-----

November 15, 2017, and as further supplemented and amended by the fourth supplemental indenture, dated as of
September 30, 2022 (collectively, the “Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture”), each between Citrix, as issuer, and
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, as applicable. The Rollover Citrix Notes
bear interest at a rate of 4.500% per annum with interest payment dates on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The
Rollover Citrix Notes will mature on December 1, 2027.

The Rollover Citrix Notes are secured by liens on certain assets of Citrix and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries that constitute part of the Collateral, equally and ratably with their obligations as guarantors under the
First Lien Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture does not limit the
amount of indebtedness that may be incurred or the amount of securities that may be issued by Citrix or its
subsidiaries. The Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture contains covenants that place certain restrictions, subject to certain
exceptions, on Citrix’s ability and the ability of any of Citrix’s significant subsidiaries to incur liens to secure
indebtedness or enter into any sale and lease-back transaction and on its ability to enter into certain consolidations
and mergers or conveyances, transfers or leases of certain of Citrix’s properties and assets or to acquire or lease all
or substantially all of the assets of another person, and also provides for customary events of default.

At any time prior to September 1, 2027, the Rollover Citrix Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Rollover Citrix Notes, plus a make-whole premium
and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date. On or after September 1, 2027,

amount of the Rollover Citrix Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the
redemption date.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of % senior secured
notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). In this description, (i) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Cloud Software
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cloud Software”), and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken together; and (ii)
the term “Company” refers only to Cloud Software and not any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date
among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (in
such capacity, the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Notes will be
issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer
Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are
referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may
not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. Copies of the
proposed form of the Indenture may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.”
The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so
defined.

The Company does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be
required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The
Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act.
Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will be:

    - general senior secured obligations of the Company, secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens (as defined below);

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Company,_
including the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes and the Indebtedness under the First Lien
Credit Agreement;

    - effectively pari passu with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company secured by a firstpriority Lien on the Collateral, including the First Lien Notes and the Indebtedness under the First
Lien Credit Agreement, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company and any Junior
Lien Obligations of the Company, including the Second Lien Notes, in each case, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral;

    - effectively junior to all existing and future indebtedness that is secured by assets that are not
Collateral;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company;

    - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor;
and


-----

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are
not Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be:

    - a general senior secured obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured on a first-priority basis by
the Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor,_
including its Guarantees of the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes and the Indebtedness
under the First Lien Credit Agreement, and, if applicable, the Indebtedness with respect to the
Rollover Citrix Notes;

    - effectively pari passu with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a
first-priority Lien on the Collateral, including its Guarantees of the First Lien Notes, the
Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement and, with respect to certain Collateral, the
Rollover Citrix Notes, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor and any
Guarantee by such Guarantor of any Junior Lien Obligations of such Guarantor, including the
Second Lien Notes, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

    - effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by
assets that are not Collateral;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024 Transaction
(as defined elsewhere in this offering circular) and the Transactions, we would have had approximately $17,550.1
million principal amount of Secured Indebtedness under the Notes, the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes, the
Citrix Rollover Notes and the First Lien Credit Agreement, and approximately $1,000.0 million of additional
borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (as defined elsewhere in this offering circular), subject to
customary conditions. Of the $17,550.1 million principal amount of Secured Indebtedness, $13,712.5 million would
have been First Lien Obligations and $3,837.6 million would have been Junior Lien Obligations.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue the Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such
Notes are subject to the applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not
a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $1,000.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on, 2032. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be
payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2024,
to Holders of record on the immediately preceding and, respectively. Interest on the Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date.
If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is after the record date and on or
before the corresponding interest payment date, then interest shall be paid in accordance with the applicable


-----

procedures of DTC. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Company may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide for the issuance of Additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the Notes
offered hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. It is intended, to the maximum
extent possible, that any such Additional Notes will be part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the
Indenture for all purposes, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that
Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP as the Notes offered hereby unless such Additional Notes
are part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Any issuance of
Additional Notes will be subject to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Indebtedness.”

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purpose (along with any other paying agent maintained by the Company, the “Paying
_Agent”) or, at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to the_
Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Notes provided that all payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in
the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office or
agency maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by each existing and future Domestic
Subsidiary that Guarantees the Company’s obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement. Certain Subsidiaries
will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Guarantees.”

As of and for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries generated
approximately 42.5% of our consolidated revenues, held approximately 5.7% of our consolidated assets and had no
debt for borrowed money outstanding, in each case after intercompany eliminations.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust
preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or
state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit
a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive
any payments on the Notes.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the
sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the


-----

Guarantor, to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not
prohibited by the Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
Discharge”;

(4) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its
obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the
Company under the First Lien Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a
Guarantor as a result of its Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor
pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” the relevant
Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such Guarantee
(it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a
release);

(5) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(6) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company,
including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company
(other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant
exceptions.

Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

The Notes and the Guarantees thereof will be secured (i) on a pari passu basis with the First Lien Credit
Agreement Obligations, the First Lien Notes and, with respect to certain Collateral, the Rollover Citrix Notes and
(ii) on a senior basis to the Second Lien Notes by perfected first-priority security interests in the same assets and
property of the Company and the Guarantors that secure the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations, the First Lien
Notes and, with respect to certain Collateral, the Rollover Citrix Notes on a first-priority basis and the Second Lien
Notes on a second-priority basis. The First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders and the Junior Lien Secured
Parties have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could also adversely affect the value
of the Collateral benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights described below under “—First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement” and under “—Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”


-----

The Company and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which
could share in the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations, Additional Junior Lien Obligations and
other Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. With respect to the Company and the Guarantors, the amount of such
Additional First Lien Obligations, Additional Junior Lien Obligations and such additional Obligations will be
limited by the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such Additional First Lien
Obligations, Additional Junior Lien Obligations and such additional Obligations could be significant.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

The Collateral securing the Notes will not include any of the following assets with respect to the Company
or any Guarantor (the “Excluded Property”): (A) any real property or real property interests (including, without
limitation, all leasehold interests in real property); (B) any lease, license or other agreement or any property subject
to a purchase money security interest, capital lease or similar agreement, in each case, to the extent permitted to be
incurred or provided under the First Lien Credit Agreement and each other applicable loan document to the extent
and for so long as the grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement,
purchase money security interest, capital lease or a similar arrangement or create a right of termination in favor of
any other Person thereto (other than the Company or a Guarantor or their Affiliates) after giving effect to the
applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or similar other applicable law, other than proceeds and
receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the UCC or other similar
applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition; (C) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters
and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are
prohibited or restricted thereby (except to the extent such prohibition or restriction is ineffective under the UCC or
other applicable law); (D) any lease, license, contract, property rights or agreement to which the Company or any
Guarantor is a party or any of its rights, properties or interests thereunder (other than proceeds and receivables
thereof) if and for so long as the grant of such security interest shall constitute or result in (i) the abandonment,
invalidation, voiding or unenforceability of any right, title or interest of the Company or any Guarantor or any of its
Affiliates therein or (ii) a breach or termination pursuant to the terms of, or a default under, such lease, license,
contract, property rights or agreement (in the case of clause (i) and (ii), other than to the extent that any such
abandonment, invalidation, voiding, unenforceability or termination would be rendered ineffective under the UCC
or other applicable law); (E) any interests or property of the Company or a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as
the grant of a security interest or Lien pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents in the Company’s or such
Guarantor’s right, title or interest therein would result in adverse accounting or regulatory consequences that are not
_de minimis, as reasonably determined by the Company; (F) motor vehicles, airplanes, vessels and any other assets_
covered by or subject to a certificate of title other than to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected by the
filing of a UCC financing statement; (G) any assets or property of the Company or a Guarantor to the extent and for
so long as the grant of a security interest or Lien pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents in the Company’s or
such Guarantor’s right, title or interest therein is prohibited or restricted by applicable requirements of law
(including any requirement to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental authority or third Person other
than the Company or a Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries, unless such consent has been obtained), or
by any contract binding on such assets or property at the time of its acquisition (or on the First Lien Notes Issue
Date) and not entered into in contemplation thereof (or in contemplation of the Merger Transactions, as applicable);
_provided that the foregoing exclusions in this clause (G) shall in no way be construed to apply to the extent that the_
prohibition is unenforceable under the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or
any other applicable law; (H) any other asset or property with respect to which the Controlling Collateral Agent and
the Company reasonably agree that the costs, burden or consequence of obtaining a security interest or perfection
thereof (including any material adverse tax consequences) are excessive in relation to the value to the Controlling
Secured Parties of the security to be afford thereby; (I) any property of any Excluded Subsidiary (as defined in the
Notes Security Agreement); (J) deposit account (including, without limitation, (i) those used for funding payroll,
healthcare and other employee wage and benefits and (ii) any tax account (including, without limitation, any sales or
VAT tax account), escrow account, defeasance account, redemption account, trust account, any other account held
in a fiduciary capacity or any other deposit account) and any cash or cash equivalents (including securities
entitlements and related assets) held therein of the Company or any Guarantor; (K) assets of the Company and the
Guarantors not located in the United States that require action under the law of any jurisdiction not located in the
United States to create or perfect a security interest or Lien on such assets, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include intellectual property registered, located or titled outside of the United States; (L) any assets to the extent a


-----

security interest in or Lien on such assets would result in adverse tax consequences that are not de minimis to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and/or direct/indirect equityholders, as reasonably determined by the
Company; (M) all commercial tort claims reasonably expected to result in a recovery of less than $4,500,000
individually; (N) all letters of credit and letter-of-credit rights (whether or not the applicable letter of credit is
evidenced by a writing) other than to the extent such letter of credit or letter-of-credit right can be perfected by the
filing of a UCC financing statement; (O) any leasehold interest in any asset, to the extent a security interest therein
cannot be perfected by filing a UCC financing statement; (P) any Excluded Equity Interests (as defined in the Notes
Security Agreement); (Q) margin stock; (R) any intent-to-use trademark application (but only until the filing and
acceptance of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto by the United States Patent
and Trademark Office; and (S) intercompany amounts payable from a Subsidiary that is a CFC to the Company or a
Guarantor; provided that in each case set forth above, such assets will immediately cease to constitute Excluded
Property when the relevant property ceases to meet this definition and, with respect to any such property, a security
interest hereunder shall attach immediately and automatically without further action.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the following
paragraph) will not be required to be in place on the Issue Date and will not be perfected on such date, but will be
required to be put in place no later than 120 days after the Issue Date or, if such security interests in the Collateral
securing the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations have not yet been perfected, such later date as agreed to by the
First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent.

In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary:

(i) the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent may grant extensions of time (including after the
expiration of any relevant period, which may apply retroactively) for the creation and perfection of security interests
in, or obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets and
such extension shall automatically apply to the equivalent provisions under the Notes Collateral Documents;

(ii) any Lien required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture and/or any action
requested in connection therewith shall be subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes Collateral
Documents;

(iii) no Guarantor nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be
authorized with respect to the Collateral, (a) to deliver or provide (or take any actions with respect to obtaining), any
mortgages, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt, leasehold mortgages, landlord waivers, estoppels, collateral access
letters, (b) to take any actions with respect to perfection by “control” other than with respect to Securities Collateral
(as defined in the Notes Security Agreement) and certain debt instruments, (c) to take any actions with respect to
any property or assets of the Guarantors under the law of any non-U.S. jurisdiction (including intellectual property
registered outside of the United States) to create or perfect a security interest in any non-U.S. jurisdiction (and no
security agreements, pledge agreements or other collateral documents governed under the laws of any non-U.S.
jurisdiction shall be required), (d) other than with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary that the Company elects, in its sole
discretion, to join as a Guarantor (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) to take any action with respect to any
assets of the Guarantors (including intellectual property) located or titled outside of, or governed by or arising under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside of, the United States, (e) to enter into any control agreements with respect to any
cash or cash equivalents (including any Cash Equivalents), deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodity

property other than UCC filings and the filing of documents effecting the recordation of security interests in the
United States Copyright Office and United States Patent and Trademark Office (upon which filing such security
interests shall be deemed perfected) or (II) any intellectual property subsisting outside the United States (and neither
the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be authorized to take any action outside of the United States to
perfect any security interests), or (h) to, in the case of each Guarantor, take any actions, and in the case of the Notes


-----

Collateral Agent, compel any Guarantor to take any actions, to grant, create or perfect a security interest in Excluded
Property;

(iv) all agreements, instruments and documents with respect to the Collateral shall be documented under,
and governed by, New York law (and to the extent applicable, federal law governing the intellectual property
Collateral), and no foreign law legal opinions shall be required with respect to the Collateral;

(v) no pledge of Excluded Equity Interests shall be required;

(vi) no perfection actions by mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure debt, leasehold mortgages, landlord
waivers or collateral access agreements shall be required to be entered into under the laws of any jurisdiction;

(vii) in the event that the Company shall at any time desire to join a Foreign Subsidiary that is an
Immaterial Subsidiary as a Guarantor, the Company and the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent shall
reasonably negotiate in good faith to subject guarantee and collateral requirements vis-à-vis any such Foreign
Subsidiary that is an Immaterial Subsidiary that the Company elects (in its sole discretion) to join as a Guarantor, to
“agreed security principles” that are customary for the jurisdiction of organization of such Foreign Subsidiary (the
“Agreed Security Principles”), and all guarantee and collateral requirements with respect to the Indenture shall, with
respect to such Foreign Subsidiary, be subject in all cases to such Agreed Security Principles; and

(viii) unless otherwise elected by the Company in its sole discretion, in no event shall (A) the assets of
any Excluded U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary (including the equity interests of any Subsidiary thereof)
constitute security or secure, or such assets or the proceeds of such assets be required to be available for payment of,
the Notes, (B) more than 65% of the Voting Stock of and 100% of the equity interests that are not Voting Stock of
any CFC Holding Company or Foreign Subsidiary, in each case, owned directly by the Company or a Guarantor be
required to be pledged to secure the Notes or (C) any equity interests of any Subsidiary owned by a Foreign
Subsidiary or Excluded U.S. Subsidiary (or any Subsidiary of any Foreign Subsidiary or Excluded U.S. Subsidiary)
be required to be pledged to secure the Notes.

**_After-acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Issue Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Company or any
Guarantor acquires any property or rights which are of a type constituting Collateral under any Notes Collateral
Document (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Property or assets not required to be Collateral
pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents), it will be required, within the time periods specified
therefor, to execute and deliver such security instruments, financing statements and such certificates as are required
under the Indenture or any Notes Collateral Document to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security
interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in such after-acquired collateral and to take such actions to add such afteracquired collateral to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral
Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired collateral to the same extent
and with the same force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, opinions of counsel will not be required in
connection with the addition of new Guarantors or in connection with such Guarantors entering into the Notes
Collateral Documents or to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent (or its bailee) a perfected security interest in afteracquired collateral owned by such Guarantors (in each case, unless such opinions are delivered to the Controlling
Collateral Agent pursuant to corresponding provisions of the First Lien Documents governing the Series of First
Lien Obligations for which such Controlling Collateral Agent is the Collateral Agent).

**_Further Assurances_**

From and after the Issue Date and subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, promptly upon the
reasonable request of the Notes Collateral Agent, the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent with respect to the
corresponding requirements under the First Lien Notes Indenture, the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
with respect to the corresponding requirements under the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Citrix Notes Collateral
Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to the corresponding requirements under
the Citrix Notes Indenture (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), the Company and the Guarantors


-----

shall (i) correct any material defect or error that may be discovered in the execution, acknowledgment, filing or
recordation of any Notes Collateral Document or other document or instrument relating to any Collateral and (ii) do,
execute, acknowledge, deliver, record, re-record, file, re-file, register and re-register any and all such further acts,
deeds, certificates, assurances and other instruments as may be necessary, or as the Notes Collateral Agent may
reasonably request from time to time in order to carry out more effectively the purposes of the Indenture or the
Notes Collateral Documents, subject to the limitations set forth above under “Certain Limitations on the Collateral”.

**_Liens with respect to the Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Company, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Notes
Collateral Documents establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These security
interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Notes Obligations of the Company and the
Guarantors.

By their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to accept the terms of, agree to be bound by
and authorize and direct each of the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into and perform its
respective obligations under and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement as an Additional Senior Class Debt Representative (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement). The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the
Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements,
or their respective representatives.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person
authorized by it) may act with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor
agreement with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the
First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”).
After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent
for the Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative).

The “Applicable Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral, (i)
until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and (ii)
from and after the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the entity that was, prior to such Controlling Collateral
Agent Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative.

The “Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral, (i) at any time
when the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect to such First
Lien Shared Collateral, the First Lien Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Series of First
Lien Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative for such First
Lien Shared Collateral.

The “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any First Lien Shared
Collateral, the Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest
outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (including the First Lien
Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral, other than the Series of First Lien
Obligations with respect to which the Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative.

With respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other
Non-Controlling Secured Party shall commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to,
seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take


-----

possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its
security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any First Lien Shared
Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral),
whether under any First Lien Document, applicable law or otherwise.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonControlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable First Lien Obligations under which such
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and
each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its First Lien Obligations has occurred and
is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of
acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided,
that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall
be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral (A) at any time the Applicable
Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral or a material portion thereof or (B) at any time
any Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any First Lien Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with
respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. If the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the First
Lien Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the
exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the First Lien Shared Collateral (including seeking relief
from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or
remedies with respect to the First Lien Shared Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to the First Lien Shared Collateral, the
Controlling Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with
the First Lien Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral, subject
to the waterfall provisions below. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling
Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and
remedies relating to the First Lien Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of
the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any
other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection,
priority, validity, value, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured
Parties in all or any part of the Collateral.

If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing,
and the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party is
taking action to enforce rights in respect of any First Lien Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of
any First Lien Shared Collateral in any insolvency and solvency proceeding of the Company (including any
adequate protection payments) or any Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to
any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any First Lien Shared
Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such First Lien Shared Collateral by the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or
remedies or distribution in respect thereof in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or any payment received by
the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement
(other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral (subject, in the
case of any such payment, proceeds, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any


-----

sale, collection or other liquidation of any First Lien Shared Collateral and all such payments, distributions, and
proceeds of any such payment or distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied:

(i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as
such) and each Authorized Representative (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any applicable First Lien
Document;

(ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of
the First Lien Obligations of each Series secured by a valid and perfected Lien on such First Lien Shared Collateral
on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance
with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that, following the commencement of any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to any Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, in the
event that the value of the First Lien Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest
on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the
maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding; and

(iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their
successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same,
or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other
recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in
accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery
in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral for which a third party (other
than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any
Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any
dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening
_Creditor”), the value of any First Lien Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be_
deducted on a ratable basis solely from the First Lien Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of
the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists.

The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other
Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien
Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations
(other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have
a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations
and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First
Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior
to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any
other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition
referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment”
of such Series); provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a
mortgage that applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First
Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of
such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the
holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in
respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the
extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First
Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are
modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy


-----

Code or any other provision of any bankruptcy law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents
governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any First Lien Shared Collateral or shall realize
any proceeds or payment in respect of any such First Lien Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or
by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the
discharge of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such First Lien Shared Collateral, proceeds
or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such First Lien Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with
the waterfall provisions above.

If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any
First Lien Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of
each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such First Lien Shared Collateral will automatically be released and
discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such First Lien
Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided, that any proceeds of any First Lien Shared Collateral
realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above, subject to the Liens in favor of the
First Lien Secured Parties on the same rights and priorities as set forth herein.

_Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become
subject to a case or proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law
and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or
more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law, each Authorized Representative
(other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any
objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the First Lien Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP
_Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes First Lien Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling_
Collateral Agent (in the case of any Collateral Agent other than the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent,
acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall then oppose or object to such DIP
Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens
are senior to the Liens on any such First Lien Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties,
each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for
which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral on the same terms as
the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP
Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with
the Liens on any such First Lien Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling
Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of
the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral as set
forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their
Liens on all such First Lien Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after
the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties
(other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any
additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection
with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral (in each case, except to the extent a Lien on additional collateral is
granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series
that does not receive a Lien on such additional collateral), with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured
Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to
repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each


-----

case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not
First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured
Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP
Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the
waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in
consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive
such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall not limit the right of the First
Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral
subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall
not constitute First Lien Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate
protection shall not (other than as a provider of DIP Financing) object to or oppose (or support any other Person in
objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any
adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of
cash collateral.

The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien
Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded,
refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and
application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining
the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

**_Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder to the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement as a Senior Class Debt Representative (as defined in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement). The
Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add
other parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant
agreements, or their respective representatives.

Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or
grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to a Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured
Parties on the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any First Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral (or any actual or
alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any applicable law, any
Junior Lien Documents or any First Lien Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever, each Junior Lien
Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Representative, in each case on behalf of itself and each Junior Lien
Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents, will agree that (a) any Lien on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared
Collateral securing or purporting to secure any First Lien Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any
First Lien Secured Parties or any First Lien Representative or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how
acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior
in all respects and prior to any Lien on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral securing or purporting to secure
any Junior Lien Obligations and (b) any Lien on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral securing or purporting
to secure any Junior Lien Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Junior Lien Representative or
other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation
or otherwise, shall be junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared
Collateral securing or purporting to secure any First Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of all First Lien
Obligations, whether or not an insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the
Company or any Guarantor, (i) neither any Junior Lien Representative nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (w)
file or commence any insolvency or liquidation proceeding against the Company or any Guarantor, (x) exercise or
seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to any First Lien - Junior Lien
Shared Collateral in respect of any Junior Lien Obligations, or otherwise commence, or join with any Person (other
than the Controlling Collateral Agent at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative) in commencing,
any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any enforcement, collection, execution,
levy or foreclosure action or proceeding, with respect to any Lien held by it on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared
Collateral under any of the Junior Lien Documents or otherwise in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations), (y)


-----

contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the First Lien - Junior Lien
Shared Collateral or any other Collateral by any First Lien Representative or any First Lien Secured Party in respect
of the First Lien Obligations, the exercise of any right by any First Lien Representative or any First Lien Secured
Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the First Lien Obligations under any lockbox
agreement, control agreement, landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which any
First Lien Representative or any First Lien Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third party
beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies relating to the First Lien - Junior
Lien Shared Collateral under the First Lien Documents or otherwise in respect of the Collateral or the First Lien
Obligations (and the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of
any Collateral Agent to contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing
any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or
any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral securing the Junior Lien
Obligations), or (z) object to the forbearance by the First Lien Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any
foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the First Lien - Junior
Lien Shared Collateral in respect of First Lien Obligations and (ii) except as provided below, the Controlling
Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy
(including setoff or recoupment and the right to credit bid their debt) with respect to the First Lien - Junior Lien
Shared Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for
exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto, in each case, without any
consultation with or the consent of any Junior Lien Representative or Junior Lien Secured Party; provided, that (A)
in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor, any Junior
Lien Representative may file a claim, proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien
Obligations under its Junior Lien Documents, (B) any Junior Lien Representative may take any action (not adverse
to the prior Liens on the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral securing the First Lien Obligations or the rights of
the First Lien Representatives or the First Lien Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to
create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the
First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral, (C) any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties
may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, to the extent provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, (D) Junior Lien Secured Parties may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any
motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the
disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties or the avoidance of any such Lien, (E) any
Junior Lien Secured Party may vote on any plan of reorganization, plan of liquidation, agreement for composition,
or other type of plan of arrangement or restructuring proposed in or in connection with any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding that conforms to the terms and conditions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and (F) from and
after the Junior Enforcement Date, the designated Junior Lien Representative (or a person authorized by it) may
exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any First Lien - Junior Lien
Shared Collateral in respect of any Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such
rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), but only so long as (1) the Controlling Collateral Agent has
not commenced and is not diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the
First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral or (2) the Company or the Guarantor which has granted a security interest
in such First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral is not then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject
to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (in each case of clauses (A) through (F) above, solely to the extent such
action is not in violation of, or otherwise inconsistent with, any other provision of the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or contrary to the Lien priorities set forth in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement). In exercising
rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, the First Lien Representatives and the First Lien Secured Parties
may enforce the provisions of the First Lien Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in
such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall
include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of First Lien - Junior Lien Shared
Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the
rights and remedies of a secured lender under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under
bankruptcy laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

The “Junior Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Junior Lien Representative, the date which is
180 consecutive days after the occurrence of both (i) an event of default (under and as defined in the Junior Lien
Document for which such Junior Lien Representative has been named as representative) and (ii) the Controlling


-----

Collateral Agent’s and each other applicable representative’s receipt of written notice from such Junior Lien
Representative that (x) such Junior Lien Representative is the Junior Lien Representative and that an event of default
(under and as defined in the Junior Lien Document for which such Junior Lien Representative has been named as
Representative) has occurred and is continuing and (y) the Junior Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to
which such Junior Lien Representative is the Junior Lien Representative are currently due and payable in full
(whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable Junior Lien
Document; provided that the Junior Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to
have occurred with respect to any First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling
Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such First Lien Junior Lien Shared Collateral or all or a material portion of the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral or (2) at
any time the Company or the Guarantor which has granted a security interest in such First Lien - Junior Lien Shared
Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding. If the designated Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party exercises any rights
or remedies with respect to the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured
Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the First
Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the Junior Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the
designated Junior Lien Representative and each other Junior Lien Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights
or remedies with respect to the First Lien - Junior Lien Shared Collateral.

**_Release or Subordination of Collateral_**

The Company and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting
Collateral from the Lien securing the Notes Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to the Company or a Guarantor, upon
termination or expiration of such lease;

(2) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of Collateral in connection with any exercise of
remedies of the Controlling Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) to enable the Company and/or one or more Guarantors to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of capital leases or the repossession of the leased
property in a capital lease by the lessor, or pursuant to investments or dividends not prohibited by
the covenants of the Note Documents) of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the
Company or a Guarantor) to the extent consummated in accordance with, or not prohibited by, the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock”;

(4) in connection with the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) in the case of any property or assets granted to or held by the Notes Collateral Agent under any
Notes Collateral Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted pursuant to


-----

certain specified baskets under the Note Documents, in each case, to the extent the contract or
agreement pursuant to which such Lien is granted prohibits any other Liens on such property;

(6) in the case any Collateral becomes Excluded Property;

(7) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

(8) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status; and

(9) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the related Note Guarantees also will be released (i)
upon payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other
Obligations under the Indenture, the related Note Guarantees and the Notes Collateral Documents that are due and
payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under “Defeasance” or a discharge of the
Indenture as described under “— Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents or
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (8) above, if, after achievement of Investment Grade Status, two of S&P, Moody’s
and Fitch withdraw Investment Grade Status or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below Investment Grade
Status, the Company and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary to provide to the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of
the Notes valid, perfected, first-priority security interests (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral within 120
days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

In addition, upon the request of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, the Notes Collateral Agent may
be required to subordinate its Lien over certain Collateral to certain other Permitted Liens that have senior priority
over such Collateral, including certain cash collateral, Liens securing Purchase Money Obligations or Finance Lease
Obligations, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among
others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and
similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and
the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period
of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the
obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first-priority
debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of
the Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by any applicable
bankruptcy law in the event that any bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be
commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed
and disposed of the Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon


-----

or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security
without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the
meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be
made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments),
whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the
payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a
debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the
bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral.

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby
on a pari passu basis), the Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the
Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such
shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to, 2027, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2027, the Company may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal
to the percentage of principal amount of the Notes being redeemed set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2027 ...................................................................................... %

2028 ...................................................................................... %
2029 and thereafter ............................................................... 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2027, the Company may redeem Notes, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with the net cash proceeds received by the
Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of the Notes
being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an
aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of
the Notes (including any Additional Notes); provided that

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering, and

(2) not less than 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the
Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently.


-----

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2027, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or
in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with the net cash proceeds received
by the Company from any Qualified IPO or a capital contribution to the Company made with the net cash proceeds
of any Qualified IPO at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided that not less
than $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) remains outstanding
immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all Notes
(including any Additional Notes) then outstanding are redeemed substantially concurrently.

At any time prior to, 2027, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes) during any twelve-month
period, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third
party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 10 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. In determining whether
the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer,
Notes owned by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company,
or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion
of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or
other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or
purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by
electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by
the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice
that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption
by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**No Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase


-----

Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase our outstanding debt
securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or
otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption
in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as
certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not so
listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC
prescribes no method of selection, the Trustee will select by lot or on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that
no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no
Note of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to
the Trustee, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in
the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to
the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30
days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance
of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will
not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
First Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. In
addition, the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture would require us to make a change of
control offer with respect to the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, respectively. Future Indebtedness of
the Company or its subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of
Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. We
have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is
possible that we could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our
capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants,
however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection
in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i)
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of
all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption
date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable
redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may
be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a
Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.


-----

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

    - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

    - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

    - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

    - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

    - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

    - “—Limitation on Guarantees”; and

    - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation and
Consolidation.”

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to
determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no
longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or
any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date that were
permitted at such time, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable
Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of
the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have
been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate
Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension
Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause
(6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the


-----

Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause
(1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In
addition, any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released during the Suspension Period. All such
further obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default or
breach of any kind will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken or the
continuance of any circumstances resulting from actions taken or the performance of obligations under agreements
entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period (other than agreements to
take actions after the Reversion Date that would not be permitted outside of the Suspension Period entered into in
contemplation of the Reversion Date).

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment
Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have occurred.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the principal amount of such Indebtedness
does not exceed an amount equal to the sum of (i) the greater of $1,235.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA and
(ii) an additional unlimited amount so long as, in the case of this clause (ii), either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) the Consolidated Total

amount equal to the sum of (I) $10,050.0 million plus (II) the greater of $2,315.0 million and
75.0% of LTM EBITDA plus (III) (i) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Pari Passu Lien Priority
relative to the Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal
amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could Incur such that,
after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, the Consolidated First Lien Secured
Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 5.25 to 1.00 (provided that for purposes of determining the
amount that may be Incurred under this clause (1)(X)(III)(i), all Indebtedness Incurred under this
clause (1)(X)(III)(i) shall be deemed to be included in clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated
First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio”), or (ii) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Junior Lien Priority
relative to the Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal
amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could Incur such that,
after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, the Consolidated Secured Leverage
Ratio is equal to or less than 7.10 to 1.00 (provided that for purposes of determining the amount

thereof;

the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligation is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any
Guarantee thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1),

Restricted Subsidiary); provided that such Indebtedness is in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed (i) the greater of $1,850.0 million and 60.0% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding
plus (ii) unlimited additional Indebtedness if, after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence
thereof and the application of the proceeds thereof, either

(a) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,

(b) (i) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes, at the
time of such Incurrence, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio is equal to
or less than 5.25 to 1.00 (provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may
be Incurred under this clause (5)(b)(i), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause
(5)(b)(i) shall be deemed to be included in clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated
First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio”), or (ii) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Junior Lien
Priority relative to the Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, the Consolidated Secured

(d) such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred
in contemplation of the transaction pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary);
_provided that the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be those Persons_
who were obligors (or who would become obligors pursuant to the definitive
documentation in respect of such Indebtedness) of such Indebtedness prior to such
Incurrence, acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation or as otherwise permitted
by this covenant;

disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than
Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or
assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided
that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets
the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time
to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type
of such Indebtedness in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having
been Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of
this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision
and any related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification (it being
understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph
of this covenant shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but
shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the
first date on which the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the First Lien Credit Agreement shall be
deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant;


-----

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(9) for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in connection with the
incurrence, issuance or assumption of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph
above or the incurrence or creation of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
otherwise, the Company may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed
amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured
by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described
below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if
such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision
of the Indenture, as applicable, is complied with (or satisfied) with respect thereto on such election
date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant
or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the Indenture, as applicable, at
the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default);

(10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with
any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence,
issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation
of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of
the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of
determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or
transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture


-----

shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an
irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with
an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the
date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent
announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited
Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments,
the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the
incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any
related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such
ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been
complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether
such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time
thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters
shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such
ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests
or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test
or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any
time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions
or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or
assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Ratio Interest Expense for
purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as
determined by the Company in good faith and without giving effect to any “pricing flex” term that
may be included in any committed financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios,
tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at
any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied
with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in
EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition
Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to
have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and
conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which
compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time
after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be
deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default
shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability
under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such
Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the
date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive
agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for
such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the
irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT
Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving
pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant or any other covenant to the contrary, (i) if (x) any
restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower component”)


-----

and (y) the grower component of the applicable restriction, basket, threshold or permission
exceeds the applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall be deemed to
increase to the highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time and shall not
subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component and (ii) in the case of
any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the
second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the
time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such
refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, shall in each case be deemed to be a permitted
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation
on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness
is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness
merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or
because it is guaranteed by different obligors.

commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving
pro forma effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma
adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment
on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such
Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including
for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and
Consolidated EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all
such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or
rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis giving
effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent
Entity or any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase,
acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of
such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of
the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions
in amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent
Entity, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Indenture.


-----

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, Incur or suffer to exist any
Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness for
borrowed money on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, except:

(1) in the case of any asset or property that constitutes Collateral, for any Subject Lien that expressly
has Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Note Guarantees; and

(2) in the case of any asset or property that does not constitute Collateral, for any Subject Lien securing
any Indebtedness if the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Subject Liens on assets or property of a Guarantor)
are secured equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures Subordinated
Indebtedness) the Obligations so secured for so long as such Obligations are so secured.

The foregoing shall not apply to Liens securing the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related
Note Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph may
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release and discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility, (b) the indentures and other
documents relating to the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes and the Rollover Citrix Notes
or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue
Date;


-----

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the
Notes Collateral Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration
in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of
such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the
transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges,
charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale
or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry
norms; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or
assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are subject to such agreement,
the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any
other asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or
property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Finance Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions
on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such
restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;


-----

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and
other similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or
industry norms;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations or Derivative Transactions;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
Incurred or issued subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign
Subsidiaries party thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable
to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture or the Indenture, in each case together with the security
documents associated therewith, or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by
the Company) and where, in the case of clause (ii), either (a) the Company determines at the time
of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes or (b) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance
of a default in respect of a payment relating to such agreement or instrument;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
Liens”; or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (16); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,


-----

contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good
faith by the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis)
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) within 24 months from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of the
Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition (as may be extended by an Acceptable
Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the “Proceeds Application Period”), an
amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Available Cash (the “Applicable
_Proceeds”) is applied:_

(a)(I) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of Collateral and the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the
terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a NonGuarantor Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary); or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase the Notes or any other First
Lien Obligations, including Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the First
Lien Notes and the Rollover Citrix Notes (or, in each case, any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect thereof); provided that, to the extent the Company redeems, repays or
repurchases such First Lien Obligations (other than the Notes) pursuant to this clause (ii),
the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided
under “— Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such
purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer
(in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all
Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be
prepaid; and

(II) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of assets or property
that do not constitute Collateral, (w) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase any
Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such asset, (x) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase
Pari Passu Indebtedness, (y) to make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to redeem Notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption” or purchase Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated
transactions, or (z) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a NonGuarantor Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary); and

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by
a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary); provided, however, that such Additional
Assets shall be pledged as Collateral (unless such Additional Assets are Excluded
Property and are not pledged to secure any other First Lien Obligations) under the Notes
Collateral Documents and in accordance with the Indenture substantially simultaneously
with such investment to the extent the assets or property disposed of constituted
Collateral; provided further that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted
application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith
expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such


-----

commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in
the event of any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason
before such amount is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within
180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is
applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds or
Excess Proceeds, as the case may be; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this_
covenant, the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Applicable Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness (including under the Credit Facilities) or otherwise apply such Applicable Proceeds in any
manner not prohibited by the Indenture, and (2) the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be)
may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset
Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the
relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition, and
consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in
accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Subject to the requirements of the Intercreditor Agreements, if, with respect to any Asset Disposition of
Collateral, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains
Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $1,545.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of
Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $1,545.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined
_Collateral Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $1,545.0_
million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Collateral Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to
Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Company shall make an offer (a “Collateral Asset Disposition Offer”) no
later than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all Holders of Notes and, if
required by the terms of any other First Lien Obligations, to all holders of such First Lien Obligations, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of such Notes or First Lien Obligations, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may
be purchased out of such Collateral Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with
original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser
price with respect to other First Lien Obligations, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other
Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Indenture and the agreements governing the other First Lien Obligations, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of a Collateral Asset
Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days
before the purchase date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing
obligation with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making an Collateral Asset Disposition Offer prior to the
expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Collateral Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the
Applicable Proceeds (the “Collateral Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any
other First Lien Obligations, as the case may be, validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with a
Collateral Asset Disposition Offer made with Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance
Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in a Collateral Asset Disposition Offer, the
Company may include any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Collateral Advance Offer, the
Collateral Advance Portion) in Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Collateral Excess
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted
value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, other First Lien Obligations validly tendered pursuant to any
Collateral Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral
Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion), the Company shall allocate the Collateral Excess Proceeds among
the Notes and other First Lien Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal


-----

amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and other First Lien Obligations; provided that no Notes
or other First Lien Obligations will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of
any Collateral Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Collateral Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero.

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition of assets or property that do not constitute Collateral, at the
expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable
Proceeds in excess of the greater of $1,545.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable
Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $1,545.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess
_Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $1,545.0 million and 50.0%_
of LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth
below, the Company shall make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the
expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Excess
Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the
accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu
Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent
electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each Holder of the Notes at
such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to
the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making
an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with
respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by
the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any
other Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Disposition
Offer made with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than the amount
offered in an Asset Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of
an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for
any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as
applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition
Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro
rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in
an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds
and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available
Cash or Applicable Percentage of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary or a CFC Holding Company (a
“Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable
organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative
impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not
be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company so long, but, for the first year, only so long, as the applicable local
law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments will not permit
repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the
Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding
Company to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been
required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or regulation, applicable
organizational documents or other impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the


-----

date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected
Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other
impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly
(and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of
additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in
compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation
of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition could reasonably
have an adverse Tax consequence, which is not de minimis (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not
limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective
affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including receipt of a Tax dividend,
deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), the Net Available Cash so affected may be
retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company and may be used to prepay indebtedness of
the Foreign Subsidiaries or invested in the business of the Foreign Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this covenant shall require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or
not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments
hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not,
for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or
a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on
such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash
Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $1,390.0 million and 45.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.


-----

The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

The First Lien Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture may
prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may
prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is
prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the
Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain
such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the
Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

To the extent that the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture with respect to the application of proceeds of Asset Dispositions, the Company shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any
Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of $620.0
million and 20.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
$925.0 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment or other transaction permitted to be made or undertaken pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (including Permitted Payments)
or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock other than Disqualified Stock, options, other equity-related
interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting,
collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other
similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to
purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted
stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or

In addition, if the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) purchases or otherwise acquires assets
or properties from a Person which is not an Affiliate, the purchase or acquisition by an Affiliate of the Company of
an interest in all or a portion of the assets or properties acquired shall not be deemed an Affiliate Transaction (or
cause such purchase or acquisition by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an Affiliate
Transaction) or (ii) sells or otherwise disposes of assets or other properties to a Person who is not an Affiliate, the
sale or other disposition by an Affiliate of the Company of an interest in all or a portion of the assets or properties

Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an Affiliate Transaction).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause an Event of Default described in clauses (1), (2) or (5) thereof. If a Restricted Subsidiary is
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for
Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the
Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the
Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate
any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was
permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and
any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of
such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation
will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” (including pursuant to clause 5(b) of the second paragraph thereof
treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause) calculated on a pro forma basis as if
such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Issue Date, the
Company will furnish to the Trustee, within 15 days after the time periods specified below:

Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), the financial statements of the Company for
such fiscal year prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a report thereon by the


-----

Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and a “Management’s Discussion and

figures for and as of the end of the previous fiscal year, commencing with the financial statements
for the fiscal year ending on or about November 30, 2024);

(2) commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 2, 2024, within 60 days (or 90 days for each of
the first three fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to be delivered pursuant to
this clause (2)) after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year ending after
the Issue Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), the
financial statements of the Company for such quarter prepared in accordance with GAAP and a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
(setting forth in comparative form the figures for and as of the end of the previous fiscal year); and

(3) within four Business Days after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports
that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form
(if the Company had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act);
_provided, that the foregoing shall not obligate the Company to make available (i) any information_
otherwise required to be included on a Form 8-K regarding the occurrence of any such events if
the Company determines in its good faith judgment that such event that would otherwise be
required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders of the Notes or the business, assets,
operations, financial positions or prospects of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, (ii) a summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement,
agreement, plan or understanding between the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any
director, manager or executive officer of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries), (iii) copies of
any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits
to a current report on Form 8-K or (iv) any trade secrets, privileged or confidential information
obtained from another Person and competitively sensitive information:

(a) the entry into or termination of material agreements;

(b) significant acquisitions or dispositions (which shall only be with respect to acquisitions or
dispositions that are significant pursuant to the definition of “Significant Subsidiary”);

(c) bankruptcy;

(d) cross-default under direct material financial obligations;

(e) a change in the Company’s certifying independent auditor;

(f) the appointment or departure of executive officers (with respect to the principal executive
officer, president and principal financial officer);

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions,

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form, except
as described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the offering
circular; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide (i) any information that is not
otherwise similar to information currently included in the offering circular, (ii) separate financial statements or other
information contemplated by Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16, Rule 4-08, Rule 13-01 or Rule 13-02 of
Regulation S-X, or in each case any successor provisions or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, (iii)
information required by Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302, Item 402 or Item 601 of
Regulation S-K (or any successor provision), (iv) XBRL exhibits, (v) earnings per share information, (vi)
information regarding executive compensation and related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A,


-----

34-54302A and IC-27444A, and (vii) other information customarily excluded from an offering circular, including
any information that is not otherwise of the type and form currently included in the offering circular relating to the
Notes. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to (i) comply with Sections
302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information,
certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such information is not so
filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed
or furnished, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such
time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not
otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount
of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary
obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have
been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company
will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and
prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing of such information to the Trustee pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of
such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic and may
be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, prospective investors in
the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of
Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that
certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), and securities analysts and market making
financial institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts and market making financial institutions, reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. To the extent the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports
available in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the
Company shall furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon their request. The Company may condition the
delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Notes, and securities analysts and market
making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information
contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for
any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such
reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in
the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the
previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the
Company’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call will be
following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10 Business Days from the time that
the Company distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No fewer than two
days prior to the conference call, the Company will issue a press release or otherwise announce the time and date of
such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective investors and market
making financial institutions to obtain access to such call.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Company, then the annual and quarterly
financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial
information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that
the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information,
if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone


-----

basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the
preceding sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the
Company has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs
with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
provisions of this covenant.

The Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether any filings or postings described above have been
made or to review or analyze any reports furnished to it. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the
Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports shall not constitute actual or constructive notice or knowledge of the information contained therein or
determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly
Owned Domestic Subsidiaries guarantee, or are a co-issuer of, other capital markets debt securities of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary or guarantee all or a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, the First Lien Credit
Agreement), other than a Guarantor, a Captive Insurance Subsidiary, a Foreign Subsidiary, a CFC Holding
Company or a Securitization Subsidiary, to Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary and joinders to the applicable
Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents, together with any filings and
agreements required by the Notes Collateral Documents to create or perfect the security interests
for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral of such Subsidiary, including all actions (if any)
required to be taken with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary in order to satisfy the provisions of
the Indenture, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with
respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee
substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such
Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against
the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted
Subsidiary under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture.

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at_
the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation
of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the Company’s
obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any
of its Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such
Subsidiary or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described above and such
Guarantee may be released at any time in the Company’s sole discretion so long as any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary then outstanding could have been incurred by such Subsidiary (either (x) when so incurred or (y) at the
time of the release of such Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary were not a Guarantor at such time.


-----

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by delivery of a
supplemental indenture and joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral
Documents, executed by the Company, to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, to cause such Immaterial
Subsidiary to automatically and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the
first paragraph above that such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial
Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be
so required to become a Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture or joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral
Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents); provided that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to
Guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors, unless it
again becomes a Guarantor.

**_Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation_**

The Company

The Company will not consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to any Person, unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States
of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company
(if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture and joinders to the
applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, all the obligations of the Company under
the Notes, the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents and if such Successor
Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation organized or existing
under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), none of the Events of Default
described in clauses (1), (2) or (5) thereof shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) upon execution of an agreement to enter into such transaction, no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction,
either (a) the applicable Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction
or (c) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company,
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to_
any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above; and

(5) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Company
are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Notes Collateral Documents, the
Company or the Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Notes Collateral Document in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or


-----

the applicable Notes Collateral Document and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that
such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Note Documents, and the Company will automatically and unconditionally be released and
discharged from its obligations under the Note Documents.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, (a) the Company may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor, (b) the Company may
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate that is (i) organized or existing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of the Company or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia or (ii) incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company,
reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company, (c) any Restricted
Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets
to the Company or a Guarantor, (d) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (e) the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may complete any Permitted Tax Restructuring; provided that, in each case, the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

The Guarantors

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge or amalgamate with or into such Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee, the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents;
and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition or transfer (including by way of
consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer,
lease, sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by
the Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, any Guarantor may (a) consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Company, (b)
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of the Guarantor, (c) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability


-----

company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (d)
liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Company determines in good faith that such action is in the best
interests of the Company and (e) complete any Permitted Tax Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this covenant, the Company may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any
Guarantor; provided that, in each case, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized or
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Any reference herein to a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer, or
similar term, shall be deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust,
or an allocation of assets to a series of a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust (or the unwinding of
such a division or allocation), as if it were a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or
transfer, or similar term, as applicable, to, of or with a separate Person. Any division of a limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust shall constitute a separate Person hereunder (and each division of any limited liability
company, limited partnership or trust that is a Subsidiary, Restricted Subsidiary, Unrestricted Subsidiary, joint
venture or any other like term shall also constitute such a Person or entity).

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee
on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture; provided that in
the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain
Covenants— Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days
after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the
“cross acceleration provision”);


-----

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal
at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $1,235.0 million and 40.0% of LTM
EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time
outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of the greater of $1,235.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at
the date of such judgment) other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or
insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain
unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes
final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other
than (1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in
accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the
Indenture or (3) in connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets
of such Guarantor and any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full
force as a result of a bankruptcy are less than the greater of $465.0 million and 15.0% of LTM
EBITDA (measured at the date of such bankruptcy);

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Notes Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and
perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless
perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents) other than (A) in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Collateral Document and the Indenture, (B) the
satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results
from the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent or other applicable Collateral Agent to maintain
possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities, instruments or similar items
pledged under the Notes Collateral Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30 days after
receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes; or

(9) the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in
any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes
Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of
all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note
Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such
security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral
Documents).

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the
Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Company


-----

does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice;
_provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to_
Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the
Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such
Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the
delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the
time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the
Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position
Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the
Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a
determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to
invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period
with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and
non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a
Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period
with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of
the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being
disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders
that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction,
such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered
to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be
deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of
Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as
the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no
duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any
Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative
Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a
Noteholder Direction.


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal
and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and
rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of
Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may
only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such
Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any
Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—
Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice
or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.
Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the
subject of litigation.

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and,
if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory
to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and


-----

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee
and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has
no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory
to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the
interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each
fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral
Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event,
which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office
specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of
Default”.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;


-----

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any
such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
amendment, supplement or modification in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of the
covenants described above under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants”
and clauses (3), (4), (6) and (7) of “—Events of Default” and the related definitions shall be
deemed not to impair the contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and
interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Note);

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence; or

(9) except as expressly not prohibited by the Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any
Significant Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Notes
Collateral Document or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the
Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the
Obligations in respect of the Notes or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Obligations in respect
of the Notes, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of the Indenture
and the Notes Collateral Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents and the
Company may direct the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into an amendment to the Note Documents
to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to
this “Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a
Guarantor under any Note Document or to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to alter the
provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including related definitions),
_provided such uncertificated Notes are in registered form within the meaning of Section 163(f) of_
the Code;

(4) add to or modify the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) at the Company’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is required;


-----

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance
of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add Guarantees
with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and
evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to
or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under
the Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee or successor Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for
the accession by the Trustee or successor Notes Collateral Agent to any Note Document;

(10) secure the Notes and/or the related Note Guarantees or to add collateral thereto;

(11) add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as not prohibited by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance
and administration of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so
amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders
to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(13) comply with the rules and procedures of any applicable securities depositary;

(14) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and/or the Notes to
eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or in the application thereof as described in the last
paragraph of the definition of “GAAP”;

(15) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the Notes Obligations, in any property or assets, including
any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is required
to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the
Indenture, any of the Notes Collateral Documents or otherwise;

(16) to add Additional First Lien Secured Parties to any Notes Collateral Document;

(17) to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the
Holders as those set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any
joinder thereto or the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any joinder
thereto;

(18) in the case of any Notes Collateral Document, to include therein any legend required to be set
forth therein pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or to modify any such legend as
required by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(19) to provide for the succession of any parties to any Notes Collateral Document (and other
amendments that are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment,
renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other
modification from time to time of the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other agreement that is
not prohibited by the Indenture; or


-----

(20) to release Collateral from the Lien securing the Notes Obligations when permitted or required by
the Indenture or any Notes Collateral Document.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Note
Documents and have Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“legal defeasance”) and cure all
then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the Company in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust.

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under “—Events of
Default” above and have Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes so long as no Notes are then
outstanding. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof
for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited
shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of
redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on
or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,
stating that beneficial owners of the Notes, in their capacity as beneficial owners of the Notes, will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income Tax on the same amounts and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United
States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S.
federal income Tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer
or exchange of the Notes and indemnification rights of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes and the Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes will be
released when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds
have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and

premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the
notice of redemption, as calculated by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws
and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed as the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent
under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default actually
known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are
set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default actually known or notified in
writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any


-----

such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet
certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been
a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of
a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent
for any loss, liability, Taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as
any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to DTC in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Person if so mailed within the time prescribed.

Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not
affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed
in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. Notices to the Trustee shall
be deemed given upon receipt by the Trustee.

thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

redemption date to             , 2027 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security
for which such yield is given, the Applicable Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to
the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such

extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the
same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based
exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or

(other than ratio based baskets) on the same date. Each item of Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion

the financial statements of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets
other than, directly or indirectly, the Capital Stock of the Company.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued
operations that have been made by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or
subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such

Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion, or disposed
or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the
reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the
Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting
officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions
and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect). If any Indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a
Finance Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Finance Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness
under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition.
Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or
similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the
rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

successor thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification),
to value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) such that the
amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Finance Lease Obligations shall be determined in
accordance with the definition of Finance Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the Company may
elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein to GAAP
shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided that any such
election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, that any calculation or determination in the Indenture
that requires the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Company’s election
to apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company shall
give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt,
solely making an election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence
of Indebtedness.

If there occurs or has occurred a change in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, or if the Company
implements a change in, or there is a change resulting from the adoption or modification of, accounting principles,
policies or practices in accordance with GAAP, and such change would cause a change in the method of calculation

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to
hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and


-----

settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers),
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also
available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).
Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the
Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each
security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the
initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of
these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes or the IAI Global Notes who are Participants may hold their
interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes or the IAI Global Notes who are
not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests
therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through
organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier),
investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than
Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of
their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the
books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject
to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be
subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take
physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of
Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in
a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners or
“Holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the Notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in
the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture
that will govern the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuer and the applicable
Trustee will treat the persons in whose names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such
Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.


-----

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants
in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions
to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to or from DTC, as applicable. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default (as defined in the
“Description of Notes”) under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in
certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have
agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change
those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

  - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes
or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor
depositary is not appointed;

  - we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes;
provided that, in no event shall Regulation S Global Notes be exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to (a)
the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under
the provisions of Regulation S; or


-----

  - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Issuer and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture that will
govern the Notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in
Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf
of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend
referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Beneficial interests in an IAI Global Note or, prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period,
beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global
Note only if:

  - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

  - the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred:

  - to a person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A and (ii)
is purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A; and

  - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note or, prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance
Period, a Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in an IAI Global Note only if:

  - the transferee is an institutional “accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3), (7), (8)
or (9) under the Securities Act that is acquiring such interest for its own account, or for the account of such
an institutional “accredited investor,” for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution in violation of the Securities Act; and

  - if required by the indenture that will govern the Notes, the transferor first delivers an opinion of counsel,
certifications, and/or other information satisfactory to us or the registrar, as applicable

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note or an IAI Global Note may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of
the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written
certificate (in the form provided in the indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the transfer is being
made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer
occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held
immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments


-----

will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the
original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note for
so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial
interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of Notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or
its nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if
no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. See “Description of the Notes—
Principal, Maturity and Interest”. Notes represented by Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in Notes represented by
Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that
secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time
zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global
Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear
and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in
Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following
DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes by U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This
summary is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to
a holder of Notes in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of
U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (such as estate and gift taxation).

This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of
the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this offering
circular. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could
significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought any ruling from
the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be
no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain
any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This summary deals only with beneficial owners of Notes that purchase the Notes for cash in this offering
at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, not
including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not address state, local,
non-U.S., estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences, or special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of
the Code or the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to
investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as:

  - banks and other financial institutions;

  - dealers or traders in securities;

  - brokers;

  - traders that have elected mark-to-market tax accounting treatment;

  - retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts;

  - tax-exempt entities;

  - S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors
in such entities;

  - insurance companies;

  - real estate investment trusts;

  - regulated investment companies;

  - non-U.S. trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries;

  - U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

  - investors that hold the Notes as part of a straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction;


-----

  - controlled foreign corporations;

  - passive foreign investment companies;

  - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

  - U.S. Holders who hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries; and

  - former citizens or residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code.

In the case of a holder of the Notes that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the tax treatment of the Notes to the partnership or a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax
status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership
considering an investment in the Notes, then you should consult your tax advisors.

The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning
and advice. Investors considering the purchase of Notes should consult their tax advisors with respect to the
application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising
under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any
applicable tax treaty.

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

We may be required to pay amounts in addition to the stated principal amount of and stated interest on the
Notes (e.g., upon a change in control as described in “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such
additional amounts does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under
applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the
issuance of the Notes, the possibility that such additional amounts will have to be paid, in the aggregate, is a remote
or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that these contingencies are, in the aggregate, remote or incidental is binding on a
beneficial owner, unless such beneficial owner explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during
which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If
the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, then the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments and a beneficial owner subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest
income on the Notes at a rate in excess of yield on the Notes in the absence of these contingencies based upon a
“comparable yield”. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with
no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be recharacterized as
ordinary income. Holders of Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes
being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will
not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations if you are a U.S. Holder. For
purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

  - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or


-----

  - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid
election is in place under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust.

_Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a Note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

_Original Issue Discount_

It is expected that the Notes will be issued to investors in this offering for a price equal to the stated principal
amount set forth on the cover page of this document. If, contrary to current expectations, the stated principal amount
of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily-defined
de minimis threshold (generally, 1/4 of 1% of the principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by the number of
complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID
for United States federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID on a Note generally is equal to the excess of the
Note’s stated principal amount over its issue price. If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder of a Note (i)
generally will be required to include the OID on a Note in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as such OID
accrues, on a constant yield basis over the term of the Note, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such
OID and regardless of its regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, but (ii)
generally will not be required to recognize any additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on the Note
that is attributable to previously accrued OID that has been included in such U.S. Holder’s income.

The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily
portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds such
Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID
allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over
the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of
principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual
period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the note as of the beginning of such accrual period
and the note’s yield to maturity (adjusted for the length of the period) less (b) the stated interest allocable to the
accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note as of the beginning of any accrual period will equal its issue
price, increased by previously accrued OID.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the
disposition and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Note, less any portion
allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as
described above under “—Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such holder, increased by any OID included in income by such
U.S. Holder with respect to such Note. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital
gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the
deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.

_Medicare Tax_

A 3.8% tax is imposed on certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts on the lesser of (1) the
U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income” in the case of a trust or estate) for


-----

the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year
over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the
individual’s circumstances). A U.S. Holder’s net investment income will generally include its interest income
(including any OID) and its net gains from the disposition of Notes, unless such interest income or net gains are
derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of
certain passive or trading activities). If you are a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to
consult your tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to a U.S. Holder’s income and gains in
respect of your investment in the Notes.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

In general, applicable payors must report certain information to the IRS with respect to payments of stated
interest, accruals of OID, and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including upon a
retirement or redemption) of a Note, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor)
may be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer
identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the
IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee
underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury
that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding
under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder will generally be allowed as a credit against that U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations if you are a non-U.S. Holder.
For purposes of this summary, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

  - a nonresident alien individual;

  - a foreign corporation; or

  - a foreign estate or trust.

The following discussion assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by a non-U.S.
Holder in respect of the Notes at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. NonU.S. Holders with any item of income, gain, deduction or loss in respect of the Notes that is effectively connected
with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
and branch profits tax consequences of investing in the Notes.

_Payment of Interest_

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest (including
any OID) paid on a Note by us or any paying agent to a non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal income
tax and withholding, provided that:

  - the non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or
constructively; and

  - either (a) the non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address on a properly executed and applicable IRS
Form W-8 delivered to the applicable withholding agent, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is


-----

not a U.S. person as defined under the Code, or (b) the non-U.S. Holder holds its Notes through certain
intermediaries and satisfies the certification requirements under applicable Treasury regulations.

If a non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (including any
OID) made to such non-U.S. Holder on the Notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate
of 30%, unless it provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8
(or suitable substitute form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the benefit of
an applicable tax treaty.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized on a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but
unpaid interest (including any OID) on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payment of
Interest”), unless the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year of the disposition of a Note and certain other requirements are met, in which case such nonU.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable tax
treaty rate applies) on any such non-U.S. Holder’s net U.S.-source gain.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

The amount of interest (including OID) paid to a non-U.S. Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld
from such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-U.S. Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may make
this information available to other parties under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty which may include
the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder is resident.

Provided that a non-U.S. Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by
providing a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the non-U.S.
Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on a Note. Certain rules
relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from
the disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note are generally as follows:

  - if the proceeds are paid to or through the U.S. office of a broker, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be
subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the non-U.S. Holder certifies under
penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W8) or otherwise establishes an exemption;

  - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or that has certain
specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but
generally not backup withholding) unless the non U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is
not a U.S. person (usually on a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8) or otherwise establishes
an exemption; and

  - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and does not
have certain specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup
withholding or information reporting.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a non-U.S. Holder will generally be allowed as a credit against the non-U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”) generally impose
U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on interest income (including any OID) paid on a Note and, subject to proposed
Treasury regulations discussed below, on the gross proceeds of a disposition of a Note paid to (i) a foreign financial
institution (whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities
substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and
debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners), and (ii)
a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (whether such foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an
intermediary), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial U.S.
owners of the entity, which generally include any U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the
entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and the applicable foreign country, or future Treasury
regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements.

Proposed Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 eliminate potential FATCA withholding on the
gross proceeds of a disposition of a Note. The proposed Treasury regulations provide that taxpayers may rely upon
such proposal until final Treasury regulations are issued.

We will not pay additional amounts or “gross up” payments to holders of Notes as a result of any taxes or
withholding imposed under FATCA. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. Holder may be eligible for a refund or
credit of such tax or withholding. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
implications of this legislation on their investment in our Notes.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and holding of the
Notes by (i) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) and other arrangements that are
subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) entities and accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include
“plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement described in clause (i) or (ii) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or otherwise, or (iv) any other plan, account or arrangement
that is subject to any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to the
fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws” and each of the foregoing described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) referred to herein as
a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation
(direct or indirect) to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and provisions of any Similar Law to such an investment, and to confirm that
the acquisition and holding of the Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any
other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law or whether an exemption
would be applicable to such acquisition and holding. In addition, in considering an investment in the Notes of a
portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar
Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification,
delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar
Laws.

Each Plan should also consider the fact that none of Issuer, the initial purchasers, any Guarantors or any of
their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide
any investment advice, including in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.
All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are
intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute
advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and
hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving “plan assets” (including “plan assets” that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code, such as IRAs or an entity deemed to hold the assets of such plans) with persons or entities
who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary
from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that
proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding
may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a
disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a
disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of


-----

any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer,
the initial purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person (including a
fiduciary) who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition
and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, an initial purchaser or a Guarantor is
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction in violation of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Notes are acquired and
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”)
that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or
holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1 respecting specified
transactions involving employee benefit plans and broker-dealers, reporting dealers and banks, PTCE 84-14
respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting
insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 9560 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by inhouse asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code provide relief for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a
disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan)
solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the
ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.
These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It
should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of
relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited
transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in
reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its
counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions
will be satisfied with respect to transactions involving the Notes.

Some Plans, including governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to
the fiduciary responsibility provisions or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a
governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its
counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if
necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under ERISA and the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons
considering purchasing or holding the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment
and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. We make no representation as to whether an
investment in the Notes is appropriate for Plans in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any
particular Plan. Neither this discussion nor anything in this offering circular is or is intended to be investment advice
directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or at such purchasers generally.


-----

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a Note, or any interest in a Note, each purchaser and
subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent
transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of, any Plan or (ii) the
acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Note by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation
under any applicable Similar Laws.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons (as such terms are defined in Regulation S) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes
are being offered only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on the
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside the
United States, to persons other than U.S. persons, in offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S.

investor” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3), (7), (8) and (9) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act) and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or for the account of another institutional
“accredited investor,” in each case in a minimum principal amount of $250,000.

(2) The purchaser understands that the Notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any
public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes have
not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it decides
to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes such Notes may be offered, resold,
pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) to us, (ii) in the United States to a person who the seller
reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (iii) to an
institutional “accredited investor” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3), (7), (8) and (9) of
Regulation D under the Securities Act) that is not a QIB that is purchasing for its own account or
for the account of another institutional investor, in each case in a minimum principal amount of
$250,000, (iv) outside the United States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule
904 under the Securities Act, (v) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act provided by Rule 144 (if available), or (vi) pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, in each of cases through (vi) in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States, and that (B) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder
is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it of the resale restrictions
referred to in (A) above.

(3) The purchaser acknowledges that neither we, the initial purchasers nor any person representing us
or the initial purchasers have made any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale
of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering circular, which has been
delivered to it. It represents that it is relying only on this offering circular in making its investment
decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase
any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us
and the initial purchasers. It acknowledges that the initial purchasers have not made any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided,
including the information contained in this offering circular.

(4) The purchaser understands that the Notes will, until the expiration of the applicable holding period
with respect to the Notes set forth in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, unless otherwise agreed by us
and the holder thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect (the “Restricted Notes
Legend”):


-----

EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR

INSTITUTIONAL “ACCREDITED INVESTOR” WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 501(a) (1), (2),
(3), (7), (8) AND (9) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT IS AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR
ACQUIRING THE NOTE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF SUCH AN
INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTOR, IN EACH CASE IN A MINIMUM PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF $250,000, (IV) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION

STATES, AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL, AND EACH SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO,
NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS NOTE FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS
REFERRED TO HEREIN.

Each purchaser of Notes offered in reliance on Regulation S will be deemed to have represented
and agreed that it is not a U.S. person and is purchasing such Notes in an offshore transaction (as such
terms are defined in Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S and understands that such Notes will, unless
otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect (the
“Regulation S Legend”):

THIS NOTE (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
ORIGINALLY EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE UNITED
STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY U.S. PERSON EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT AND ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. TERMS USED
ABOVE HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT.

Notes bearing the Restricted Notes Legend may be exchanged for Notes not bearing the Restricted
Notes Legend but bearing the Regulation S Legend upon certification by the transferor in the form set forth
in the indenture that will govern the Notes that the transfer of any such restricted note has been made in
accordance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act. We understand that under current market practices
settlement of the transfer of any such Note may be effected through the facilities of DTC, but that prior to
the 40th day after the latest of the commencement of this offering and the last original issue date of the
Notes, any such transfer may only occur through the facilities of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. See the
section entitled “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance.”

(5) Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of the Notes will be deemed to have represented and
agreed that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes
for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or
hold the Notes, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of, any Plan or (ii) the acquisition,
holding and subsequent disposition of the Note by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute
or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to
have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and
the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor
account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and
agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers are obligated to purchase all of the Notes if any
are purchased. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to
the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The purchase agreement also provides that, if an


-----

initial purchaser defaults with respect to its obligations to purchase the Notes, the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting initial purchasers with respect to the Notes may be increased or, in some cases, the offering with respect
to the Notes may be terminated.

We have agreed that, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering circular, we will not, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or
the Guarantors or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its debt securities (“LockUp Securities”): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer,
sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities,
(iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic
consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or
decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or
(v) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Lock-Up Securities or publicly
disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the representative.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the relevant offering price on the cover page of
this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. The initial purchasers may
offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. In addition, one or more of the initial purchasers may not be
U.S.-registered broker-dealers. All sales of the Notes in the United States will be made by or through U.S.-registered
broker-dealers, which may include such affiliates of one or more of the initial purchasers.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs
in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Each of the initial
purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes
(i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the
offering and the closing date of the offering, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells Notes in reliance on Regulation S during such
40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about       , 2024, which will be
the          business day following the date of this offering circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+  ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
Notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the Notes initially settle in T+ , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period
should consult their advisors.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the
United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering), may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A, or another
exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

The Issuer and the guarantors party thereto have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments which they may be required to
make in that respect.

The Notes constitute a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Certain initial
purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are
not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at
their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the
Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be
adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending


-----

on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition,
general economic conditions and other factors.

The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

  - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial
purchasers.

  - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do
not exceed a specified maximum.

  - Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

  - Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the
Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover
short positions.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions, and in the
ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have in
the past and may in the future engage in investment banking or other transactions of a financial nature with Cloud
Software and its affiliates, including the provision of certain advisory services and the making of loans to Cloud
Software and its affiliates, for which they have received or may receive customary compensation. Certain of the
initial purchasers and/or their affiliates act as joint lead arrangers, joint bookrunners and/or lenders under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and receive customary fees for performing those services. In particular, certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates act as agents and/or lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and,
as a result, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering, and/or customary compensation for acting in such capacities. See “Use of Proceeds” for more information.

In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may be now or in the future be
party to certain of our hedging arrangements. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the
initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and
equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities
and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those
initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of the Notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities
and instruments. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “affiliate” includes parent companies.

**Notice to Canadian Residents**

The Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1)
of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.


-----

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering circular (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or
consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a nonCanadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding initial purchaser
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the
“Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offer of the Notes. This offering circular is not to be considered a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the EEA.

**United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No.
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended,
the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be lawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.
This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and FSMA from a requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of securities. This offering circular is not a prospectus for purposes of the UK Prospectus
Regulation or the FSMA.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc.

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’/member’s equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of November 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended November 30, 2023 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they
would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:

  - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.


-----

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

  - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we
identified during the audit.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

**_The Company_**

Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc. (also referred to herein as “Holdings”) is a Delaware corporation that
is the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group, Inc. (f/k/a TIBCO Software Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Cloud
Software Group”). Holdings has no significant assets or operations other than the ownership of Cloud Software
Group. Holdings is owned by Picard Holdco, Inc. (“Holdco”), a Delaware corporation. The common stock of
Holdco is owned by certain affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (“VEP”) and Evergreen Coast
Capital Corp. (“Evergreen”), an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management L.P. (“Elliott”). Both VEP and Elliott
are private investment firms. The Series A Preferred Stock of Holdco is held by certain other investors. Holdings (i)
has no liabilities other than those incidental to its ownership of the equity interests in Cloud Software Group, and (ii)
has no assets other than its ownership of all of the equity interests of Cloud Software Group. As a result, there are no
material differences between the historical financial data of Holdings and the historical financial data relating to
Cloud Software Group. References to “the Company”, “us”, “we”, or “our” in these consolidated financial
statements refer to the consolidated operations of Holdings and its subsidiaries.

Prior to the merger with Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”) on September 30, 2022 (the “Merger”), we
implemented a plan to create a new organization structure. Balboa Intermediate Holdings LLC (“Intermediate
Holdings”) was a Delaware limited liability company, the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group, and the
previous reporting entity for the group. Intermediate Holdings had no significant assets or operations other than the
ownership of Cloud Software Group. Intermediate Holdings was owned by Balboa Holdings LP (“Balboa Holdings
LP”), a Delaware limited partnership that was owned by certain affiliates of VEP. Intermediate Holdings distributed
their ownership shares of Cloud Software Group to Balboa Holdings LP.

On January 28, 2022, Holdco and Holdings were formed under Balboa Holdings LP. Cloud Software
Group contemporaneously formed Picard Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”). Parent then formed Picard
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”). The aforementioned entities were formed for the sole
purpose of consummating the Merger.

On February 10, 2022, Elliott formed Elliott Alto Aggregator L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(“Aggregator LP”) that ultimately represents their ownership in Holdco.

On September 30, 2022, the Merger and related transactions and reorganization were executed, with
Holdings becoming the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group and its subsidiaries, which includes Parent, the
sole shareholder of Citrix. As a result of the reorganization, Holdings became the reporting entity from Intermediate
Holdings. On December 1, 2022, TIBCO Software Inc. changed its name to Cloud Software Group, Inc. Refer to
Note 4 for additional information on the Merger.

Cloud Software Group is a leading provider of mission-critical solutions to enterprise organizations around
the world. We were created by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading global enterprise-focused
software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of brands under the management of Cloud Software
Group which we believe positions us to become one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing
comprehensive, secure and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our collective
capabilities help our customers advance their hybrid cloud information technology (“IT”) strategies and meet the
needs of the modern enterprise. This combination of Citrix’s and TIBCO’s product portfolios allows us to offer
solutions to address organizations’ most complex use-cases, serve as a centralized vendor for senior IT buyers
within large enterprises and leverage an array of go-to-market (“GTM”) capabilities for our buyer and customer
bases. We have realized significant operational improvements and expect to pursue additional opportunities in the
near-term to drive cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies. We also believe that our management team’s
track record of identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions positions Cloud Software Group to capitalize on
further enterprise software market consolidation. Some of our key brands include Citrix, TIBCO and NetScaler
amongst others.

Citrix is a leading provider of infrastructure for secure hybrid work through virtual desktop infrastructure
(“VDI”) and desktop-as-a-service (“DaaS”) with global software development teams and core technologies that

security to help enterprises efficiently consolidate their application delivery and security infrastructure. Following
the strategic review and change in GTM strategy, many of the products previously offered under the Citrix App
Delivery & Security product line now go to market within the NetScaler product line.

**_Financial Statement Preparation_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

**_Fiscal Year_**

The Company operates and reports using a fiscal year ending on November 30. We refer to the fiscal years
ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, as our fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

**2.** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that
the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts and
reserves, purchase price allocation of business combinations, restructuring liabilities and charges, legal
contingencies, valuation of common stock and related stock-based compensation, right-of-use (“ROU”) assets,
carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, deferred sales commissions including the period
of benefit of customer acquisition costs, and accounting for income taxes, including the valuation of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, among others, have the greatest potential impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We deliver our solutions through direct sales channels, independent software vendors, distributors, and
value-added resellers. Key sources of revenue include:

  - Subscription revenue: consists of sale of software, rights to unspecified future products and maintenance,
and includes revenue from (i) term-based licenses and related support for a variety of on-premise offerings
and (ii) hosted software as a service (“SaaS”) licenses. Subscription offerings deliver the products, updates,
and upgrades through the term of the agreement for a single fee and are available through on-premise or
cloud deployment models.

  - Product and license revenue: includes software products sold as perpetual and term-based licenses, with
optional maintenance, and to a lesser extent, the sale of hardware products. Licenses are usually sold
through product license agreements in case of smaller deployments and enterprise agreements for larger
scale deployment with multiple products. License agreements typically include maintenance, which is
charged in addition to the license fee. Subscription revenue and product and license revenue are presented
together as software revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  - Maintenance revenue: consists of fees for providing software updates on a when-and-if available basis and
technical support for software products. Maintenance contracts provide customers with rights to
unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the
support and include online access to technical content, as well as online and telephone access to technical
support personnel, and are usually priced as a percentage of the net on-premise license fees.

  - Professional services revenue: consists primarily of revenue received for assisting with the implementation
of software, on-site support, training, and other consulting services to deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade,
and secure our customer’s investments in their applications and infrastructure technologies. Many
customers who license our software also enter into separate professional services arrangements with us.
Maintenance revenue and professional services revenue are presented together as services and maintenance
revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into
contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being
distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a
variable amount, for example, price concessions, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, we include
an estimate of the amount we expect to receive for the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant
reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, when the uncertainty related to the variable consideration
is subsequently resolved. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts
_with Customers, we determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following_
steps:

  - Identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;

  - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

  - Determination of the transaction price;

  - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

  - Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.

We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights
regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, and the payment terms for the products or
services can be identified. We determine whether the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and if the contract


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

has commercial substance. Standard payment terms vary, including based on the country in which the contract is
executed, but are generally between 30 and 60 days. Payment terms provide customers with a simplified purchasing
experience aligned with the industry and are not intended to secure financing for either party. We assess
collectability at the onset of the arrangement, primarily based on the customer’s creditworthiness and collection
history. We do not offer right of return or retrospective price protection to any of our customers. At contract
inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract.
Our contracts do not contain warranties that give rise to separate performance obligations.

For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each
performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each distinct product or service in the
contract.The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling
price basis for those performance obligations with stable observable prices and the residual method is applied for
any performance obligation with highly variable pricing. We apply judgment to determine whether promised
products or services are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the
promised products or services are combined with other products or services and accounted for as a combined
performance obligation. Revenue is then recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on our
evaluation of when the customer obtained control of the promised products or services. This evaluation requires
significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract
into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue recorded in a given period.

In addition, we have developed assumptions that required judgment to determine the SSP for each
performance obligation identified in the contract. We determine the SSP for a product or service by considering
multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographies, market conditions, product life cycles, competitive
landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, purchase volumes and pricing practices. We review the SSP for
each of our performance obligations on a periodic basis and update it, when appropriate, to ensure that the practices
employed reflect our recent pricing experience and maximize the use of observable data. When a contract includes
an option for a customer to purchase additional products or services at a stated price, we evaluate whether the option
provides a material right and if so, allocate a portion of the transaction price to such right based on SSP.

Subscription revenue related to on-premise term license agreements includes software licenses, rights to
unspecified future products and maintenance. Subscription revenue relating to the software license performance
obligation is recognized upfront when we transfer control of the license to the customer while the revenue relating to
the maintenance and related rights to unspecified future products, is recognized ratably over the term of the
subscription. The control of the software license is considered to be transferred upon delivery to the customer or the
subscription start date, whichever is later. Subscription revenue for SaaS offerings is recognized ratably over the
term of the agreement. Invoices are generally issued when products are made available to a customer for new
transactions and in advance of the subscription period for renewals. Billing terms are generally annual with standard
payment terms.

License revenue is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to
the customer. Provided all other revenue criteria are met, the upfront, minimum, non-refundable license fees from
original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers are recognized upon delivery, and on-going royalty fees are
recognized based on OEM units shipped. Revenue on shipments to resellers is recognized when all revenue criteria
are met and is recorded net of any consideration payable to the resellers. Invoices are generally issued when
products are made available to the customer and follow standard payment terms.

Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Invoices are issued annually in
advance. Payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Professional services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for assisting with the implementation
of software, on-site support, training, and other consulting services. Many customers who license the software also
enter into separate professional services arrangements with us. Judgment is involved in determining whether the
separate consulting agreements need to be considered together with software products to be combined and accounted
for as a single contract. If contracts are determined to be economically linked, the total transaction price across the
contracts are allocated across the various performance obligations. Substantially all of the professional services


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and, accordingly, are recognized as the services are performed.
Contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees are recognized on a proportional performance model based on actual
services performed. If there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for
professional services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. Work performed and
expenses incurred in advance of invoicing are recorded as unbilled receivables. These amounts are billed subsequent
to when the work was performed. Training revenue is recognized as training services are delivered. Payments
received in advance of consulting or training services performed are deferred and recognized when the related
services are performed.

We have included the appropriate disclosures by applying the following practical expedients in the
application of ASC 606:

  - We exclude from revenue the taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and
concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected from customers;

  - If at contract inception we expect that the period between performance and customer payment will be one
year or less, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing
component; and

  - We expense contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing such costs
would have been amortized in one year or less.

**_Contract Balances_**

The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable,
contract assets, and customer advances and liabilities (deferred revenue and contract liabilities) on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Contract assets relate to our right to consideration for products delivered or services completed and
recognized as revenue and are transferred to billed accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional and
invoices are issued to the customer. Contract assets are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other
current assets or other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on whether they are classified as current
or noncurrent. We evaluate contract assets for impairment whenever changes in events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. There were no impairment losses incurred
for any of the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, or 2021.

Unearned revenue consists of amounts from subscription and service and maintenance revenue contracts
that have not been recognized as revenue because the delivery of promised products and services has not yet
occurred. Unearned revenue will be recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied or the
contingency relating to revenue recognition has been resolved. Unearned revenue is classified as either current or
noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue and disclosed as such on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

These contract assets and liabilities are reported on a net contract-by-contract basis at the end of each
reporting period.

**_Deferred Sales Commissions_**

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the
benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the
requirements to be capitalized. Commissions for such contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be five years. We determine the period of benefit by taking
into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our
technologies, and other factors. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of Sales and
marketing expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations while the unamortized portion of the deferred
sales commissions are included as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on whether they are classified as current or noncurrent.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**

The fair values of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, do not materially differ from their carrying amounts due to their short maturities. The fair values of our
derivative instruments are detailed further in Note 5.

The fair value of our debt is based on market quotes and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. See Note 9 for further details on our debt agreements.

**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**

Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions or invested in security issuers that management
believes are creditworthy. The Company maintains deposits with financial institutions in amounts above federally
insured limits. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition and, generally, require no
collateral from customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on various factors,
including review of credit profiles of customers, contractual terms and conditions, current economic trends, and
historical payment experience.

No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the years ended November 30, 2023,
2022, and 2021. We had no customers that had a balance in excess of 10% of our net accounts receivable as of
November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.

**_Inventory_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a standard cost basis, which
approximates actual cost. The Company’s inventories consist of components and finished goods as of November 30,
2023 and 2022.

**_Prepaid expenses_**

Prepaid expenses represent cash paid in advance for various software or cloud subscriptions, insurance
policies and corporate taxes. Prepaid expenses are included within the prepaid expenses and other current assets in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $96.4 million and $105.5 million as of November 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.

**_Property and Equipment, net_**

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. These assets
are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Buildings 10-30 years
Computers and equipment 3-5 years
Software 2-5 years
Furniture and fixtures 3-5 years
Facilities improvements Shorter of the lease term or 10 years


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Leases_**

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the
lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental
borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets related to our
operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus
any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives, Accounting Standard Codification ASC 420, “Exit or
_Disposal Cost Obligations” (ASC 420) liabilities, and accrued rent. Our lease terms that are used in determining our_
operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is
reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense
generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as
operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we
generally account for the components as a single lease component.

ROU assets related to our operating leases are included in Other assets, short-term operating lease liabilities
are included in Accrued liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities are included in Other long-term
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash flow movements related to our lease activities are included in
Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities as presented in net cash
provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended November 30,
2023 and 2022. See Note 16 for more information regarding our leases.

We review leases for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of
other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future
undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. Refer to Note 16 for more
details.

We also sublease certain office space to third-parties. Our subleases consist of office space which was
vacated as part of restructuring activities.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment
at least annually, in circumstances such as a change in reporting units, or whenever there are indications that their
carrying value may be impaired.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise over the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
ASC 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” and perform an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth
quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have
occurred. For the purposes of testing for impairment, we have determined that we have five reporting units.

To assess if goodwill is impaired, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether
quantitative impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, we consider it more-likelythan-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is
performed. This includes comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and, in a second step,
the measuring of such impairment.

The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value. The
estimate of the fair value, based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, is subjective and
requires judgment, including management assumptions about expected future revenue and earnings forecasts and
discount rates, changes in the overall economy and other factors. We perform our annual impairment test at
September 30 of each fiscal year. To date, no impairment has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
Historically, we assessed the recoverability of our goodwill as of the last day of our fourth quarter. In fiscal year
2023, we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment to September 30 to better align with our


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

strategic business planning process and allow for operational expediency. The Company believes this change does
not represent a material change to a method of applying an accounting principle. This voluntary change in
accounting principle, applied prospectively, is preferable as it aligns the annual goodwill impairment test date more
closely with our internal budgeting process and did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment of our goodwill.

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

Acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. We evaluate the recoverability of
long-lived assets, which includes amortizable intangible and tangible assets, in accordance with authoritative
guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. We evaluate long-lived assets, other
than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these
assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the net asset group exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows
to be generated from the use of the asset group, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to
measure fair value and to determine the impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of
intangible assets and other long-lived assets to assess whether a revision to the remaining periods of amortization is
required. No long-lived assets impairment losses were incurred in the periods presented.

**_Business Combinations_**

Under the accounting guidance for business combinations, we recognize separately from goodwill the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are
recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy) as of the date of the acquisition. Goodwill as of the
acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date values of
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. None of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions
executed through the acquisition of an entity’s stock is deductible for income tax purposes.

While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to
accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date, estimates and assumptions
are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the preliminary purchase price allocation
period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may record adjustments to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the preliminary purchase
price allocation period, we record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed in operating results in the
period in which the adjustments were determined.

The total purchase price allocated to the tangible assets acquired is assigned based on the fair values
(except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy) as
of the acquisition date. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired is determined on an income
approach, using either the profit allocation method, the relief-from-royalty method, or the multi-period excess
earnings method. Under the profit allocation method, we estimate the value of an asset by capitalizing the profit
saved due to our owning the asset, rather than paying a royalty for its use. Under the relief-from-royalty method, we
estimate the value of an asset by capitalizing the royalties saved because the company owns the asset. We generally
use the profit allocation method or the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired trade names and developed
technology intangible assets. Under the multi-period excess earnings method, we estimate the value of an asset
based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the
intangible asset over its remaining economic life. We generally use this approach to value acquired customer
relationships and maintenance agreement intangible assets.

Intangible assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which
approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as follows:

Existing technologies 4-7 years
Maintenance contracts and related customer
relationships 1-11 years
Customer base (subscriber and license customer
agreements, and related relationships) 2-10 years


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

Trademarks 4-10 years

**_Acquisition Related and Other Costs_**

Acquisition related and other costs consist of expenses incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet
for a particular transaction (whether or not such transaction is ultimately completed, remains in-process or is not
completed) and include legal, banker, accounting and other advisory fees of third parties and severance costs for
employees of the acquired company that are terminated within 90 days of the acquisition date.

**_Income Taxes_**

Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc., a corporation owned by Picard Holdco, Inc., holds interests in Cloud
Software Group, Inc. which are subject to federal and state income taxes.

We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement
purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.

As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current tax
exposures, if any, under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in current taxes payable and deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two-step approach to
recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to
determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained upon audit, whether or not under audit, including contemplated resolution of any related appeals or
litigation processes. If the first step is met, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely to be sustained upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions
due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, or refinement of estimates due to new
information. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such
differences will impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which such
determination is made.

We assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and consider all available
evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with
estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for
a valuation allowance. If there is a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would
increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax
assets.

**_Foreign Currencies_**

We have certain foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency of their respective countries as their
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of
the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Cumulative
translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
Stockholders’/Members’ Equity. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses, derived from monetary assets and
liabilities stated in a currency other than the functional currency, including transactions denominated in the local
currencies of foreign operations with the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, are recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as part of Other expense, net. We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $79.5 million, $17.1
million, and $5.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Derivative and Hedging Activities_**

We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage currency exposure related to net
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and these forward contracts are generally settled
within twelve months from trade dates. The gains and losses on these derivative instruments are intended to offset
the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the underlying foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities
subject to remeasurement and transaction exposures, and therefore, these forward contracts do not subject us to
material balance sheet risk. From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our
interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.

In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we record derivatives at fair value as either assets or
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For derivatives that are designated as and qualify as cash flow
hedges, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings as Operating expenses, when the hedged transaction
affects earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings as
Other expense, net, or Interest expense, net, in the period during which changes in fair value occur.

**_Capitalized Software Development Costs_**

Capitalization of software development costs begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been
established. We define technological feasibility as the establishment of a working model, which typically occurs
when beta testing commences. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general
availability of our software products has been insignificant. Accordingly, software development costs have been
expensed as incurred, with the exception of costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely for
internal use.

Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely for internal use, with no substantive plans
to market such software at the time of development, are evaluated for capitalization. Costs incurred during the
preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post-implementation operational stage are
expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. These
costs are included in Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the useful life of the software.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

Certain employees and non-employees have been granted awards with service based vesting and/or
performance conditions. We account for such awards in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock
_Compensation”. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award at the grant_
date. The grant date fair value of service based awards is amortized over the requisite service period on a straightline basis. We also grant certain awards that have performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense for
performance awards is recognized over the period from the date the performance conditions are determined to be
probable of occurring through the date the applicable conditions are expected to be met. If the performance
conditions are not considered probable of being achieved, no expense is recognized. The Company accounts for
forfeitures as they occur. See Note 15 for further information regarding the Company’s stock-based compensation
plans.

**_Advertising Expense_**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are charged to Sales and marketing expense and totaled
approximately $4.0 million, $11.6 million, and $9.0 million for the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and
2021, respectively.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”. The
guidance enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (ASC 740), including requirements related to hybrid tax regimes, the tax
basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, the intraperiod tax allocation
exception to the incremental approach, the year-to-date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting, and interimperiod accounting for enacted changes in tax law. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We adopted this
ASU on December 1, 2022, which did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”. This
ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with
its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount
exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying
amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This
ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this ASU on December 1, 2022, which
did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”, which requires the
measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This ASU is intended to improve
financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. This
standard is effective for non-public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim
reporting periods therein. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses
_(Topic 326)”. This guidance affects all entities after they have adopted ASU 2016-13. ASU 2022-02 amends ASC_
310 to eliminate the recognition and measurement guidance for a troubled debt restructuring for creditors that have
adopted ASC 326 and requires them to make enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty. The guidance also requires public business entities to present gross write-offs by
year of origination in their vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASC 326, the guidance is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
that have not yet adopted ASC 326 will apply the new guidance when they adopt ASC 326. We do not expect the
adoption of these ASUs to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Improvements to Income
_Tax Disclosures”. The ASU requires that an entity disclose specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation_
as well as provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Further, the ASU
requires certain disclosures of state versus federal income tax expense and taxes paid. The amendments in this ASU
are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for
annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis
although retrospective application is permitted. We have not early adopted ASU 2023-09 for November 30, 2023.
We are currently evaluating the impact of future adoption on our financial disclosures.

2021 was $36.7 million, $14.5 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. There were no impairments of deferred
commissions for the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

**4.** **Business Combinations**

We recognize separately from goodwill, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at their fair values,
except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as
of the date of acquisition. Goodwill generated from our business combinations is primarily related to the value
placed on employee workforce, service offerings and capabilities, and expected synergies.

**_Acquisitions_**

**_Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”)_**

Effective September 30, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), VEP and Elliott completed their acquisition of Citrix
and combined it with Cloud Software Group (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, total consideration was
$15,389.1 million, of which $124.8 million consisted of non-cash consideration in the form of rollover equity of
Elliott management and $113.0 million consisted of an assumed liability for the portion of the replacement equity
awards issued in connection with the acquisition that were associated with services rendered through the date of the
acquisition (“Merger Consideration”). The Merger was funded through a combination of cash, rollover equity,
contributions by Holdco, and debt financing.

The results of Citrix’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the
close of the Merger on September 30, 2022. The Company incurred $50.6 million in transaction costs, which were
included in operating expenses for fiscal year 2022.

See Note 1 for a description of Citrix’s business.

The following is a summary of the purchase price consideration (in thousands):

Base purchase price .......................................................................................................... $ 11,836,760
Non-cash consideration of rollover equity ....................................................................... 124,800
Closing indebtedness ........................................................................................................ 3,259,870
Consideration to settle stock-based compensation [(1)] ....................................................... 167,653
Total purchase price consideration ................................................................................... $ 15,389,084

(1) Holders of deferred stock unit awards and restricted stock units received payments of cash and replacement cash
awards at $104.00 per share. Equity awards that were vested, outstanding, and exercised immediately prior to
the effective date of the Merger were automatically converted into a right to receive cash from the Company.
Other equity awards that were unvested were automatically canceled and converted into the contingent right to
receive an aggregate amount in cash (referred to as a converted cash award) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such Citrix
stock option, by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Citrix common stock that would have been issuable upon
exercise of such Citrix stock option immediately prior to the effective time. The converted cash awards were
subject to generally the same terms as the corresponding, canceled equity award, including vesting conditions.
Amount includes cash consideration of $54.0 million related to vested stock awards and a non-cash assumed
liability of $113.0 million related to the replacement equity awards described above.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

The Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). This requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
measured at fair value. The Company estimated, using Level 3 inputs, the fair value of fixed assets using a
combination of the cost approach and the market approach.

Specific to intangible assets, trade names and developed technology were valued using the relief from
royalty method, a variation of the income approach, and customer relationships and maintenance agreements were
valued based on the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach.

The Company has recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of
the purchase date (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue
recognition policy). The allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Citrix as of September 30, 2022 is as
follows (in thousands);

Cash .................................................................................................................................. $ 889,287
Accounts receivable.......................................................................................................... 603,104
Inventories ........................................................................................................................ 24,622
Prepaid expenses and other current assets ........................................................................ 105,339
Property and equipment .................................................................................................... 114,013
Goodwill ........................................................................................................................... 6,240,723
Operating lease right-of-use assets ................................................................................... 77,079
Identifiable intangible assets ............................................................................................ 11,630,000
Long-term deferred income tax assets .............................................................................. 10,795
Other assets....................................................................................................................... 131,852
Accounts payable ............................................................................................................. (144,650)
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities ................................................................. (404,151)
Income taxes payable ....................................................................................................... (29,445)
Unearned revenue ............................................................................................................. (1,433,848)
Long-term unearned revenue ............................................................................................ (293,917)

Long-term deferred tax liabilities ..................................................................................... (1,717,451)
Other long-term liabilities ................................................................................................ (48,589)
Total purchase price .................................................................................................... $ 15,389,084

The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed in the acquisition was allocated to goodwill in the amount of $6,240.7 million. The goodwill is not
deductible for tax purposes.

The identifiable intangible assets described above were as follows (in thousands, except amortization
period):

**5.** **Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments**

**_Investments_**

**_Equity Securities Accounted for at Net Asset Value_**

The Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $13.0 million and $14.2 million as of
November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are accounted for under the net asset value practical expedient.
These investments are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The net asset value
of these investments is determined using quarterly capital statements from the funds, which are based on the
Company’s contributions to the funds, allocation of profit and loss and changes in fair value of the underlying fund
investments. These private equity funds focus on making venture capital investments, principally by investing in
equity securities of early and late stage privately held corporations. The funds’ general partner shall determine the
amount, timing and form (whether cash or in kind) of all distributions made by the funds. The Company may only
transfer its investments in private equity fund interests subject to the general partner’s written consent and cannot
trade its fund interests in established securities markets, secondary markets or equivalents thereof. The Company
had no unfunded commitments as of November 30, 2023.

**_Equity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Values_**

The Company held direct investments in privately-held companies of approximately $24.3 million as of
November 30, 2022, respectively, which were accounted for at cost, less impairment plus or minus adjustments and
which were included in Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments were
impaired during fiscal year 2023 and fully written off as of November 30, 2023.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

FASB guidance for fair value measurements clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the
guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
(Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in
active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is
little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use
observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair
value. On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including foreign
currency contracts.

We execute foreign currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements primarily in the retail market in
an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually
are large multi-national and regional banks. The valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing
intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended November 30, 2023,
2022, and 2021. As of November 30, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted only of cash held in our
bank accounts.

**_Derivative Instruments_**

We conduct business in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific and
Japan (“APJ”). As a result, the financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or changes in economic conditions in foreign markets. The U.S. dollar is the major transaction
currency; we also transact business in approximately thirty-six foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

significant to operations are the Euro, British pound, and Indian rupee. Derivative instruments are recognized as
either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are initially reported as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently recognized in income. Gains
and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in Other
expense, net. The total cumulative unrealized gain on cash flow derivative instruments was $4.4 million as of
November 30, 2023. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow derivatives are included in Accumulated other
comprehensive income(loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gain as of
November 30, 2023 is expected to be recognized in income over the next 12 months at the same time the hedged
items are recognized in income.

We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage currency exposure related to net
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and these forward contracts are generally settled
within 90 days from trade dates. Our forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency
exchange rate movements. For those contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized
currently in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements or other instruments to manage our interest
rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on our debt. We may choose whether or not to
designate these contracts as hedges. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was derived from discounted
cash flow analysis based on terms of the contract and the forward interest rate curves adjusted for our credit risk.
The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within
Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our interest rate swap agreements.

The following tables summarize the fair value of our derivative instruments and their location in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

2028. For the year ended November 30, 2023, we recorded a gain of $57.6 million.

**_Refinancing_**

We evaluate amendments to the terms of our debt agreements in accordance with ASC 470-50 “Debt _Modification and Extinguishments”. We assess whether changes to the terms of the loans are substantial and,_
accordingly, conclude whether each refinancing should be accounted for as a debt extinguishment or modification.
The terms of the debt are considered substantially different if the present value of the cash flows of the term loans
under the Senior First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended, was at least 10% different (“10% Test”) from the present
value of the remaining cash flows of the original terms loans, and we performed this 10% Test for each individual
creditor who participated in the loan syndication.

Accordingly, loans that remained obligations of the same lender that resulted in substantial (>10%) changes
in cash flows and loans held by lenders that existed as part of the refinancings were accounted for as debt
extinguishments. Loans that remained obligations of the same lender that resulted in less than substantial (<10%)
changes in cash flows, were accounted for as debt modification

For the year ended November 30, 2023, refinancing activities resulted in a $31.3 million charge included
under interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, which is comprised of $19.3 million
in refinancing costs and $12.0 million related to the expensing of unamortized original issuer’s issuance costs
associated with the extinguished debt.

(1) Upon adoption of ASC 842, certain restructuring lease liabilities were required to be recognized as a reduction
to the corresponding ROU assets.

We review our impairment of long-lived assets, including ROU assets, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. Measurement of an impairment loss
is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value of the ROU assets is determined
by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets.

We re-evaluated our real estate needs, resulting in a reduction of owned space and leased space, and the
impairment of the associated ROU assets and property and equipment. Due to the actions taken, we tested the
operating lease ROU assets and certain property and equipment for recoverability by comparing the carrying value
of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset group. Based on the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the undiscounted
cash flows of the asset groups were below the carrying values, indicating impairment. We then determined the fair
value of the asset groups by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets.
For the year ended November 30, 2023, we recognized $29.3 million which primarily consisted of depreciation
expense for property and equipment and ROU lease impairment charges which were recorded as Restructuring
charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

**12. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Letters of Credit_**

As of November 30, 2023 and 2022, we had a total of $0.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively,
outstanding with respect to letters of credit in connection with customer contracts and facility lease transactions.

As of November 30, 2023, contractual commitments associated with indebtedness are as follows (fiscal
years, and in thousands):

**Total** **2024** **2025** **2026** **2027** **2028** **Thereafter**
Commitments:
Debt principal ........... $ 15,989,912 $ 83,945 $ 112,016 $ 121,401 $ 121,401 $ 2,180,225 $ 13,370,924
Debt interest [(1)] ......... $  7,720,839 $  1,407,399 $  1,408,915 $  1,397,290 $  1,385,114 $  1,368,381 $   753,740
Total commitments ... $ 23,710,751 $ 1,491,344 $ 1,520,931 $ 1,518,691 $ 1,506,515 $ 3,548,606 $ 14,124,664

(1) Assumes SOFR at 5.4%. and EURIBOR at 4%

The above commitment table does not include $215.2 million of long-term uncertain income tax liabilities
due to the fact that we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments.

**_Purchase Obligations_**

We have obligations to purchase inventory for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024 of $8.9 million.
We do not have any such purchase obligations beyond November 30, 2024.

As a result of the Merger, we have an agreement with a third-party provider, in the ordinary course of
business, for the use of certain cloud services through June 2029. Under the amended agreement, we are committed
to purchase $1,010.0 million throughout the term of the agreement. As of November 30, 2023, we had $685.6
million of remaining obligations under the agreement.

**_Indemnifications_**

Our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual
property infringement claims. To date, no such claims have been filed against us. We also warrant to customers that
software products operate substantially in accordance with the software product’s specifications. Historically, we
have incurred minimal costs related to product warranties, and, as such, no accruals for warranty costs have been
made. In addition, we indemnify our officers and directors under the terms of indemnity agreements entered into
with them, as well as pursuant to our organizational documents and applicable Delaware law.

**_Guarantees_**

The authoritative guidance requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor
to make disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. For those
guarantees and indemnifications that do not fall within the initial recognition and measurement requirements of the
authoritative guidance, we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and
indemnifications, as required under existing generally accepted accounting principles, to identify if a loss has been
incurred. If we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, any such estimable loss would be
recognized. The initial recognition and measurement requirements do not apply to the provisions contained in the


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

majority of our software license agreements that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs
resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We have
not made material payments pursuant to these provisions. We have not identified any losses that are probable under
these provisions and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions.

**13. Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are involved in or subject to legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings,
claims, demands and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or
against us with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought
against our customers for whom we have a contractual indemnification obligation. We accrue for a liability when it
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant
judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is
reasonably estimable. After we determine the probability of a loss and whether that loss is reasonably estimable, we
then analyze whether the litigation, based on that determination, could have a material and adverse effect on our
financial statements, taken as a whole and including our statement of cash flows. The accruals or estimates, if any,
resulting from the foregoing analysis, are reviewed at least quarterly, and adjusted to reflect the impact of
negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular
matter. To the extent that it is probable and reasonably estimable that the losses could exceed the amounts already
accrued, we will, as applicable, adjust the accrual in the period the determination is made, disclose an estimate of the
additional loss or range of loss, indicate that the estimate is immaterial with respect to our financial statements as a
whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate cannot be
made.

Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters, we believe that outcomes that may
materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows are reasonably
possible but not estimable at this time.

**_Securities Class Action_**

On November 19, 2021, a Citrix shareholder filed a putative securities class action complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming the Company and certain of its current and former
officers and directors as individual defendants, and claiming to have purchased Citrix stock at artificially inflated
prices during the period between January 22, 2020, and October 6, 2021 and suffered damages as a result of alleged
violations of federal securities law. On April 22, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, naming the same
defendants and alleging substantially similar securities violations as the original complaint, including violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b5, promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly false or misleading statements regarding the Company’s transition
from selling on-premises, perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions. The amended complaint seeks, among
other things, an award of compensatory damages and the Plaintiffs’ reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and other costs and disbursements. In January 2023, the Court granted Citrix’s motion
to dismiss the case in its entirety. On August 8, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the
dismissal. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 6,
2023, Appellants filed a Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice. On December 12, 2023, the Court dismissed the case.

**_Legal Proceedings Related to the Merger_**

On December 12, 2022, Juan Vargas, a purported Citrix shareholder, filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Citrix and its former Board of Directors. The Complaint
alleges that the Company’s Board of Directors used false projections to conceal the true value of Citrix from Citrix
shareholders, and thereby secure the approval of Citrix’s shareholders to sell Citrix to Vista Equity Partners and
Elliott Investment Management L.P. for an inadequate and unfair price. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of the use of
such projections, the Definitive Proxy Statement filed in connection with the Merger omitted material information,
rendering the Definitive Proxy Statement false and misleading. Plaintiff alleges that the Company and the individual
defendants violated Sections 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Plaintiff also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary

damages. Citrix has put its carrier on notice of this as a related claim to the sale related litigation matters. On
February 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act. No other plaintiffs filed competing motions, and on March 8, 2023, the judge appointed Juan Vargas
and George Messiha as lead plaintiffs. In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and the Company filed
its motion to dismiss the claim in July 2023. The Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on January 25,
2024. The Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to these allegations;
however, the Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential exposure
or loss, if any.

Legorreta, et al. v. Calderoni, Delaware Court of Chancery Case No. 2024-0153: A class action complaint
was filed on February 19, 2024, in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a law firm that obtained documents from
Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”) through a Section 220 books and records demand in 2022 and 2023. The complaint
alleges a single claim, for breach of fiduciary duty against former Citrix Chairman and CEO Robert Calderoni, in
connection with the January 31, 2022 Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in the combination of Citrix
with TIBCO Software Inc. The complaint alleges that Mr. Calderoni breached his fiduciary duties by approving the
proxy statement sent to shareholders soliciting approval of the merger that was allegedly misleading and by not
securing a higher purchase price for Citrix shares. The Company believes that the defendant has meritorious
defenses to the allegations in the complaint.

**_Books and Records Demands_**

The Company received demand letters pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(“DGCL”) from stockholders seeking disclosure of certain of the Company's records relating to the Merger. The
Company has responded to those demands, stating its belief that the demand letters fail to fully comply with the
requirements of Section 220 of the DGCL. On April 20, 2022, two stockholders filed a complaint in the Delaware
Chancery Court captioned Liebenthal, et al. v. Citrix Systems, Inc., C.A. No. 2022-0349, seeking to compel
inspection of books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL. Citrix produced certain material related to the
request, including redacted board meeting minutes. On October 7, 2022, plaintiffs’ counsel sent a list of additional
document requests and redaction issues, to which Citrix’s counsel produced a supplemental production. On February
22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a status update letter with the Court stating that Citrix intends to produce a final set of
documents after which Plaintiffs intend to dismiss their enforcement action. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their
action on March 7, 2023. It is still possible that Plaintiffs could file a breach of fiduciary duty or similar action in
Delaware. The statute of limitations for fiduciary duty claims is three years.

**_Consumer Class Actions Arising from NetScaler Security Vulnerability_**

On October 10, 2023, the Company published a notice identifying a vulnerability in its on-premises
NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway products (CVE-2023-4966) and simultaneously released a software patch to
NetScaler users to remedy the vulnerability. Starting on December 19, 2023, twenty-one nationwide putative class
action lawsuits were filed against Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”) alleging various state law claims based on data
breach incidents experienced by Company customers, where such incidents allegedly arose from exploits of CVE2023-4966 (collectively, the “CVE-2023-4966 Class Actions”). Of the original twenty-one cases filed, five have
been dismissed by the plaintiffs, leaving sixteen cases pending as of March 4, 2024.

**The Comcast Cases**

On December 18, 2023, Citrix customer Comcast Cable Communications, d/b/a Xfinity (“Comcast”) sent
customers a notice stating that, between October 16, 2023 and October 19, 2023, before Comcast applied the patch
to fix the CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability, Comcast experienced a data breach that it concluded was a result of the
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability. Following the Comcast December 18, 2023 announcement, plaintiffs have filed
seventeen putative class action lawsuits against Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”) in three different district courts (S.D.
Florida, E.D. Pennsylvania, and South Carolina), asserting claims for negligence, negligence per se, breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, unjust enrichment, and
other state law claims, based on Comcast’s identification of CVE-2023-4966 in connection with Comcast’s data
breach. The cases are as follows: Verdier v. Comcast Corporation d/b/a Xfinity and Citrix Systems, Inc., Case No.
2:23-cv-05137 (E.D. Pennsylvania); Brown v. Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Citrix Systems, Inc., Case

_Communications, et al., Case No. 2:24-cv-793 (E.D. Pennsylvania); Estevez v. Citrix Systems, Inc., et al., Case No._
2:24-cv-800 (E.D. Pennsylvania). The foregoing cases, fifteen of which include Comcast as a co-defendant, are
referred to here as the “Comcast Data Breach Actions”. With the exception of three cases (Birnie, McCauley, and
_Werner), each of the Comcast Data Breach Actions erroneously alleges that Citrix had possession of the Comcast_
customer data at the time of the breach. The plaintiffs in Hammond and Carey voluntarily dismissed Citrix on
February 14 and March 1, respectively, leaving fifteen Comcast Data Breach Actions pending against Citrix as of
March 4, 2024.

On January 4, 2024, a plaintiff in one of several cases against Comcast only (i.e., where Citrix is not named
a co-defendant) concerning the Comcast data breach pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, filed a Motion
to Consolidate and Transfer (“MDL Motion”) with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, seeking to transfer
and consolidate all Comcast Data Breach Actions to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for all pretrial proceedings.
Briefing on the MDL Motion is complete and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) has set a
hearing on the motion for March 28, 2024. A decision from the JPML is anticipated in March or April 2024.

Other than one judge in the Southern District of Florida, judges have granted the parties’ requests to delay
filing responsive pleadings in the cases until after the JPML decides on the MDL Motion. Accordingly, Citrix was
required to file a response to the complaint in Brown on February 26, 2024, and did so in the form of a motion to
dismiss. There are five additional Comcast Data Breach Actions pending before the same judge, with at four of
those actions currently requiring that a responsive pleading be filed by Citrix prior to the JPML hearing on March
28, 2024.

**Non-Comcast Cases**

On February 16, 2024, a plaintiff filed Cole v. Planet Home Lending, LLC & Citrix Systems, Inc., Case
0:24-cv-60269 (S.D. Florida) naming Citrix as a co-defendant in connection with a data breach experienced by
Planet Home Lending on November 15, and which, according to news articles, impacted approximately 200,000
individuals. Relying on alleged facts substantively similar to those in the Comcast Data Breach Actions, the Cole
complaint alleges claims for negligence, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against Citrix. Seven other
cases against Planet Home Lending are currently pending in federal court in Connecticut.

On January 7, 2024, a plaintiff’s counsel, who originally filed a complaint on December 19, 2023, in the
Southern District of Florida against Citrix and Comcast, amended the complaint to name a new plaintiff as the class
representative for the putative class action, substituted Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“FHCC”) in place of
Comcast as a defendant, and revised the complaint to allege claims arising from a customer data breach announced
by FHCC on December 28, 2023, on the basis that FHCC stated on its website that the actors who exfiltrated the
FHCC customer data “exploited a vulnerability in a software called Citrix”. The amended complaint was captioned
in Paves v. Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Paves”) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Case No. 0:23-cv-62375 (S.D.
Florida). Citrix entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff in the Paves case, resulting in Citrix being
dismissed with prejudice from Paves on February 6, 2024.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

Two additional putative class action lawsuits filed against Citrix in January 2024 (Dailey v. Citrix Systems.
_Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case No. 0:24-cv-60038-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Daily”) and Newell v. Citrix Systems,_
_Inc., Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case 0:24-cv-60048-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Newell”)_
erroneously alleged that CVE-2023-4966 had a role in a data breach experienced by LoanCare. Following a clear
communication from LoanCare to the plaintiffs that Citrix products had no role in the data breach, the plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed both the Newell and Dailey case without prejudice on January 30, 2024.

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in all of the CVE-2023-4966 Class
Actions; however, the Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of these matters or the
potential exposure or loss, if any.

**14. Related Party Transactions**

We have transactions with various other portfolio companies of VEP and Elliott in the ordinary course of
business. For the years ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.5 million and $1.1 million
respectively in expenses related to VEP. Such activity for the year ended 2021 was not material to the consolidated
financial statements. VEP provides us with certain management consulting services. We reimburse VEP for any outof-pocket expenses.

For the year ended November 30, 2023, we paid Holdco dividends of $1,197.5 million in cash that was
used to partially redeem Series A Preferred Shares of Holdco and to pay cash dividends to holders.

On September 29, 2022, Holdco contributed $11.1 million of note receivable interest from TIBCO as a
capital contribution.

In connection with the Merger, Holdco contributed 100% of the shares in Cloud Software Group valued at
$1,671.1 million and 1.2 million shares in Citrix valued at $124.8 million as of the acquisition date to the Company
as a capital contribution. Additionally, upon the closing of the Merger, the Company received $3,566.0 million in
cash contributions from Holdco. The Company also received $2.7 million in non-cash contributions from Holdco
related to the future use of tax attributes from a member of the consolidated income tax filing group as of November
30, 2022. In addition the Company received $3.7 million in non-cash contributions from Holdco as of the year ended
November 30, 2023.

On November 24, 2021, Bali Finco Inc. (“Finco”), a newly formed investment vehicle owned by funds
managed by VEP and formed in connection with a proposed acquisition, issued a promissory note for $75.0 million
to the Company in exchange for cash. The promissory note originally bore interest at a rate of 0.22% per annum and
had a maturity date of November 24, 2023. The $75.0 million related party note to Finco was repaid in full in
December 2021, as the proposed acquisition was not consummated. Finco was dissolved on September 21, 2022.

In connection with the proposed acquisition, at VEP’s request, the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $29.8 million towards the settlement of forward contracts and the release of associated debt
commitments previously contracted by Finco related to its proposed acquisition in December 2021. These amounts
were recorded as “Acquisition related and other costs” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year
ended November 30, 2022.

**15. Stock-Based Compensation**

**_2022 Incentive Plan_**

The Board of Holdco adopted the Picard Holdco, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended to date, the
“Equity Plan”). The Equity Plan authorizes the issuance of up to an aggregate of 671,646 shares of common stock in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other stock
based awards. The awards settle into Picard Holdco,Inc equity. These awards may be granted to officers, employees
and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Stock Options_**

Stock option incentive service awards vest over four years with 25% vesting after 12 months and an
additional 6.25% vest at the end of each full three calendar month period thereafter. If the employee is, and has
been, continuously employed by the Company through the date of consummation of an approved sale, any incentive
service awards which were unvested incentive service awards immediately prior to such approved sale are deemed
vested units. Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the incentive service units during the years ended
November 30, 2023 and 2022 was $10.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense related to unvested incentive service stock option awards is $32.9 million as of November 30,
2023 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

Stock option incentive performance awards vest in tranches of 50% upon consummation of a change in
control or IPO if the total equity return multiple is equal or greater than 2.0x and the remaining 50% upon a 2.5x
attained multiple and if the employee has been employed continuously at the consummation of such an event. All
incentive performance awards that are not vested as of the consummation of an approved sale shall terminate and be
of no value as of the consummation of such approved sale. Since a liquidity event is a contingent event and not
considered probable until the event occurs, no compensation expense for the incentive performance units was
recognized for the year ended November 30, 2023. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
related to the unvested incentive performance stock option awards is $45.4 million as of November 30, 2023.

These stock option incentive awards are primarily equity-classified awards as there is no requirement for
cash settlement and they are only settled in shares that require a hold period of at least six months passing the risk of
ownership to the option holder. The value of these equity classified stock option incentive awards is determinable as
of the grant date. There is a portion of stock option incentive service units that are liability-classified given they
contain an unrestricted put option at the option holder’s discretion at specified periods after the anniversary of the
grant date.

The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option incentive awards using the Black-Scholes
valuation model, whereby the allocable equity value of the Company is divided by the fully diluted shares to
calculate the fair value of the underlying common stock. The stock volatility for each grant is estimated from the
historical daily price changes of comparable companies. The expected term of options granted is derived from the
weighted average of estimated time to fully vesting of the incentive performance stock awards through a vesting
event and the contractual life of the award, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods aligns with the expected life of the option is based on the Daily U.S.
Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the
Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.

The grant date fair value of performance and service-based stock option incentive awards granted in 2023
and 2022 was calculated using the following assumptions:

**Assumption** **Value**
Fair value of common stock ($) ........................................................................................ 785
Risk-free interest rate (%) ................................................................................................ 4
Expected term (years) ....................................................................................................... 6
Expected volatility (%) ..................................................................................................... 35
Expected dividend yield (%) ............................................................................................ —

The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options issued for the years ended November 30, 2023
and 2022 were, $262.82 and $260.47, respectively.

**_Restricted Stock Units_**

During the year ended November 30, 2023, we granted 128,889 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the
Equity Plan. The RSUs have a grant date fair value of $1,000 per unit and vest over a term of four years with a
March 1, 2023 vesting commencement date. As of November 30, 2023, 4,833 units were forfeited due to employee
terminations. Upon forfeiture, the forfeited units were cancelled, returned to the pool, and are available for future
distribution.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized for RSUs for the twelve months ended November 30, 2023
was $23.2 million. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs is $100.9
million as of November 30, 2023 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Cash Conversion_**

All legacy Citrix stock compensation related plans were terminated concurrently with the Merger on
September 30, 2022. Per the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 30, 2022, by and between Cloud
Software Group, Holdco, TIBCO Merger Sub, Inc., and Balboa Holdings LP (the “Agreement and Plan of Merger”),
all vested awards that were outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the acquisition were canceled, retired,
and ceased to exist and were converted into the right to receive cash at an amount equal to the per share merger
consideration, less any applicable exercise price. Subsequent to the closing of the Merger and before November 30,
2022, the Company paid approximately $90.4 million in cash for the vested stock awards and applicable taxes.

Per the Agreement and Plan of Merger, all unvested awards that were outstanding as of immediately prior
to the acquisition were canceled, retired, and ceased to exist and converted into the right to receive cash (“cash
awards”) over the original respective vesting schedule at an amount equal to the per share merger consideration, less
any applicable exercise price. The payments are conditional upon the employees’ continued employment with the
Company and any additional expense is recorded consistent with the cost center mapping for each employee on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. A liability of approximately $113.0 million related to the cash awards was
assumed as part of the Merger with the remainder of the expense to be recognized over the course of the original
vesting schedule. Any forfeitures of these awards will be recognized as incurred.

We recorded approximately $75.3 million in expenses in the period after the Merger and before November
30, 2022. Of that amount, $35.7 million was expensed related to the vesting of awards paid out immediately upon
the close of the Merger. The remaining $39.6 million was expensed related to the vesting of cash awards during the
period after the Merger and before November 30, 2022. For the year ended November 30, 2023, the Company
recorded approximately $92.2 million in expenses. As of November 30, 2023, there was $14.0 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards. The unrecognized cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 0.3 years.

**_Balboa Plans_**

The Board of Managers of Balboa Holdings LP adopted the Balboa Holdings LP Management Incentive
Plan (“the Plan”), under which Balboa Holdings LP granted long-term target incentive cash awards of
approximately $41.4 million to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, which became payable upon
a liquidity event if a defined equity return multiple is achieved. The amount of cash award to be paid is equal to the
target incentive multiplied by the difference between the defined equity return multiple and 1. As the multiple is tied
to an equity valuation, any compensation charge associated with these awards is considered stock-based
compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”. As a result of the Merger, we
recognized an expense of $76.4 million and paid out a portion of the amount during the fiscal year ended November
30, 2022.No liability remains outstanding as of November 30, 2023 with respect to the Plan.

In addition, Balboa Holdings LP authorized the issuance of 103.4 million management incentive units
(“management incentive units”) to certain employees and non-employees of the Company and its subsidiaries that
vest over five years. The management incentive units contain both service and performance conditions. Holders of
such units are entitled to a pro rata cash payout in excess of their participation threshold on the occurrence of a
liquidity event. In connection with the Merger, we recognized an expense of $72.7 million related to these awards
during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022. A liability of $31.2 million was outstanding as of November 30,
2022. We recognized an expense of $2.7 million and paid out the remaining amount during the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2023. No liability remains outstanding as of November 30, 2023 with respect to the management
incentive units.

**16. Leases**

As of November 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded ROU assets of $67.6 million and $129.9
million in Other Assets respectively. Short-term lease liabilities of $37.5 million and $85.6 million were included in
Accrued liabilities as of November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-term lease liabilities of $211.7 million
and $257.1 million were included in Other long term liabilities as of November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

At various locations worldwide, we lease office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating
leases with various expiration dates through May 2038. In addition to rent, the leases require the Company to pay for
taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses. Certain of these leases contain stated escalation clauses
while others contain renewal options. The Company recognizes lease expense, which is the sum of interest and
amortization expense on each contractual payment, on a straight-line basis. If a lease has been previously impaired,
the Company no longer recognizes straight-line lease expense, but rather recognizes amortization of the ROU asset
on a straight-line basis over the term remaining on the contract.

The components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):

**November 30,**

Net undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As of
November 30, 2023, and 2022, we had $21.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of deferred tax liability, and a
corresponding provision for U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon.

The following table summarizes our effective tax rate for fiscal years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and
2021:

**Year Ended November 30,**
**2023** **2022** **2021**
Effective tax rate ............................................................ 24% 32% 60%

The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 24% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 and
32% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate when comparing the fiscal
year ended November 30, 2023 to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in the
valuation allowance of deferred tax assets related to Section 163(j) interest expense limitation.

The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and
60% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of
the prior year integration and the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 release of the valuation allowance of
deferred tax assets related to the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation and foreign tax credits as a result of the
significant deferred tax liabilities acquired through the merger with Citrix.

The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows
(in thousands):

The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if,
based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of November 30, 2023, the Company determined a $509.1 million valuation allowance was
necessary, which primarily relates to deferred tax assets for capital loss carryforwards, Section 163j interest
limitation carryforwards, tax credits, and net operating losses.

As of November 30, 2023, our capital loss carryforward before valuation allowance for income tax
purposes was $288.7 million. The capital losses will begin to expire in fiscal year 2028 if not utilized. Our Section
163j interest limitation carryforward before valuation allowance for income tax purposes was $308.2 million and it
can be carried forward indefinitely. We provided a valuation allowance of approximately $335.5 million for deferred
tax assets related to capital losses and Section 163j carryforwards that are not expected to be realized.

As of November 30, 2023, our federal, state, and foreign net operating losses carryforwards before
valuation allowance for income tax purposes were approximately $41.2 million. The utilization of these net
operating loss carry forwards are limited in any one year pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and may
begin to expire in 2025. As a result, we provided a valuation allowance of $17.8 million for deferred tax assets
related to domestic and $2.0 million of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not
expected to be realized.

As of November 30, 2023, the Company held $314.7 million of federal and state research and development
tax credit carry forwards in the United States, a portion of which may begin to expire in 2027. Subsequently, we
provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized related to federal and
California research and development tax credits of $1.7 million and $143.6 million, respectively.

The changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for the year ended November 30, 2023 and
2022, are as follows (in thousands):


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

Current year decrease .................................................................... (12,026) (75,588)
Ending balance .................................................................................... $ 509,097 $ 429,048

The current year increase in the valuation allowance for fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to the
establishment of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to the Section 163(j) interest expense
limitation.

A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021
are as follows (in thousands):

**Year Ended November 30,**
**2023** **2022** **2021**

Total unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of

period ........................................................................... $ 215,202 $ 230,058 $ 118,024

For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits totals
approximately $215.2 million compared to $230.1 million as for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022. At
November 30, 2023, $198.0 million included in the balance for tax positions would affect the annual effective tax
rate if realized. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to uncertain tax positions and penalties in income
tax expense. As of November 30, 2023, the Company accrued $25.3 million for the payment of interest.

The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income taxes in the United
States, as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Specifically, Citrix is currently under
review by the United States Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2017 through 2018. With few exceptions, the
Company is generally not subject to examination for state and local income tax, or in non-U.S. jurisdictions by tax
authorities for years prior to 2018. The statute of limitations for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 remains open for
material foreign tax jurisdictions.

Due to the uncertainty of tax audit outcomes and the timing of tax audit settlements, we are unable to
estimate the changes to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.

**18. Subsequent Events**

We have evaluated subsequent events and transactions through March 8, 2024, the day financial statements
were available to be issued, and noted no events or transactions that would require recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements other than the following:

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company implemented cost reductions that included the
elimination or redundancy of approximately 12% of its and its subsidiaries’ workforce as part of its planning process
for the combined company.

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

**_The Company_**

Cloud Software Group Holdings, Inc. (also referred to herein as “Holdings”) is a Delaware corporation that
is the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group, Inc. (f/k/a TIBCO Software Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Cloud
Software Group”). Holdings has no significant assets or operations other than the ownership of Cloud Software
Group. Holdings is owned by Picard Holdco, Inc. (“Holdco”), a Delaware corporation. The common stock of
Holdco is owned by certain affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (“VEP”) and Elliott Investment
Management L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Elliott”). Both VEP and Elliott are private investment firms. The
Series A Preferred Stock of Holdco is held by certain other investors. Holdings (i) has no liabilities other than those
incidental to its ownership of the equity interests in Cloud Software Group, and (ii) has no assets other than its
ownership of all of the equity interests of Cloud Software Group. As a result, there are no material differences
between the historical financial data of Holdings and the historical financial data relating to Cloud Software Group.
References to “the Company”, “us”, “we”, or “our” in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
(the “Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”) refer to the consolidated operations of Holdings and its
subsidiaries.

Prior to the merger with Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”) on September 30, 2022 (the “Merger”), we
implemented a plan to create a new organization structure. Balboa Intermediate Holdings LLC (“Intermediate
Holdings”) was a Delaware limited liability company, the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group, and the
previous reporting entity for the group. Intermediate Holdings had no significant assets or operations other than the
ownership of Cloud Software Group. Intermediate Holdings was owned by Balboa Holdings LP (“Balboa Holdings
LP”), a Delaware limited partnership that was owned by certain affiliates of VEP. Intermediate Holdings distributed
their ownership shares of Cloud Software Group to Balboa Holdings LP.

On January 28, 2022, Holdco and Holdings were formed under Balboa Holdings LP. Cloud Software
Group contemporaneously formed Picard Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”). Parent then formed Picard
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”). The aforementioned entities were formed for the sole
purpose of consummating the Merger.

On February 10, 2022, Elliott formed Elliott Alto Aggregator L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(“Aggregator LP”) that ultimately represents their ownership in Holdco.

On September 30, 2022, the Merger and related transactions and reorganization were executed, with
Holdings becoming the sole shareholder of Cloud Software Group and its subsidiaries, which includes Parent, the
sole shareholder of Citrix. As a result of the reorganization, Holdings became the reporting entity from Intermediate
Holdings. On December 1, 2022, TIBCO Software Inc. changed its name to Cloud Software Group, Inc. Refer to
Note 3 for additional information on the Merger.

Cloud Software Group is a leading provider of mission-critical solutions to enterprise organizations around
the world. We were created by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading global enterprise-focused
software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of brands under the management of Cloud Software
Group which we believe positions us to become one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing
comprehensive, secure and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our collective
capabilities help our customers advance their hybrid cloud information technology (“IT”) strategies and meet the
needs of the modern enterprise. This combination of Citrix’s and TIBCO’s product portfolios allows us to offer
solutions to address organizations’ most complex use-cases, serve as a centralized vendor for senior IT buyers
within large enterprises and leverage an array of go-to-market (“GTM”) capabilities for our buyer and customer
bases. We have realized significant operational improvements and expect to pursue additional opportunities in the
near-term to drive cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies. We also believe that our management team’s
track record of identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions positions Cloud Software Group to capitalize on
further enterprise software market consolidation. Some of our key brands include Citrix, TIBCO and NetScaler
amongst others.

**_Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”) for interim
financial information and present the results of operations of Holdings on a consolidated basis. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in
conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2023 included in our 2023 Annual Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement have been included.

The preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of amounts in
the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current
presentation.

Holdings operates and reports using a fiscal year ending on November 30, while interim periods end on a
Sunday in accordance with a 4-4-5 calendar. For purposes of presentation, we have indicated the first quarter of
fiscal years 2024 and 2023 as ended on February 28, 2024 and February 28, 2023, respectively; whereas in fact, the
first quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended on March 3, 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 ended on March 5,
2023. There were 94 days and 95 days in each of the first quarters of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023,
respectively.

The results of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2024, or any other future period, and we make
no representations related thereto.

**_Summary of Significant Accounting Policies_**

Our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements were described in Note 2
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023
Annual Report for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our
accounting policies since November 30, 2023.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”, which requires the
measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This ASU is intended to improve
financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. In
March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)”. This guidance
affects all entities after they have adopted ASU 2016-13. ASU 2022-02 amends ASC 310 to eliminate the
recognition and measurement guidance for a troubled debt restructuring for creditors that have adopted ASC 326
and requires them to make enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. The guidance also requires public business entities to present gross write-offs by year of origination in
their vintage disclosures. The Company has adopted the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The
standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements during the
quarter ended February 28, 2024.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Improvements to Income
Tax Disclosures”. The ASU requires that an entity disclose specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation
as well as provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Further, the ASU
requires certain disclosures of state versus federal income tax expense and taxes paid. The amendments in this ASU
are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for
annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis
although retrospective application is permitted. We have not yet adopted ASU 2023-09. We are currently evaluating
the impact of future adoption on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

**3.** **Business Combinations**

We recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values,
except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as
of the date of acquisition. Goodwill generated from our business combinations is primarily related to the value
placed on employee workforce, service offerings and capabilities, and expected synergies.

**_Acquisitions_**

**_Vast Limits GmbH_**

On December 27, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), we acquired all outstanding shares of capital stock of Vast
Limits GmbH (“Vast Limits”), the builders of the uberAgent technology. Citrix Observability capabilities will be
enhanced with the addition of uberAgent by extending visibility and providing performance, application usage,
security, and compliance insights. The purchase price was not publicly disclosed and remains, along with the other


-----

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

terms of the acquisition, confidential. Financial information has not been presented for this acquisition as the impact
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is not material. The results of Vast Limit’s operations have
been included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements since the close of the acquisition on December
27, 2023.

**_Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”)_**

Effective September 30, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), VEP and Elliott, completed their acquisition of Citrix
and combined it with Cloud Software Group (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, total consideration was
$15,389.1 million, of which $124.8 million consisted of non-cash consideration in the form of rollover equity of
Elliott and $113.0 million consisted of an assumed liability for the portion of the replacement equity awards issued
in connection with the acquisition that were associated with services rendered through the date of the acquisition
(“Merger Consideration”). The Merger was funded through a combination of cash, rollover equity, contributions by
Holdco, and debt financing.

The results of Citrix’s operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the
close of the Merger on September 30, 2022. The Company incurred $50.6 million in transaction costs, which were
included in operating expenses for fiscal year 2022.

For a description of Citrix’s business, see Note 1 - “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” above.

The following is a summary of the purchase price consideration (in thousands):

Base purchase price .......................................................................................................... $ 11,836,760
Non-cash consideration of rollover equity ....................................................................... 124,800
Closing indebtedness ........................................................................................................ 3,259,870
Consideration to settle stock-based compensation [(1)] ....................................................... 167,653
Total purchase price consideration ................................................................................... $ 15,389,084

(1) Holders of deferred stock unit awards and restricted stock units received payments of cash and replacement cash
awards at $104.00 per share. Equity awards that were vested, outstanding, and exercised immediately prior to
the effective date of the Merger were automatically converted into a right to receive cash from the Company.
Other equity awards that were unvested were automatically canceled and converted into the contingent right to
receive an aggregate amount in cash (referred to as a converted cash award) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Citrix
stock option, by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Citrix common stock that would have been issuable upon
exercise of such Citrix stock option immediately prior to the effective time. The converted cash awards were
subject to generally the same terms as the corresponding, canceled equity award, including vesting conditions.
Amount includes cash consideration of $54.0 million related to vested stock awards and a non-cash assumed
liability of $113.0 million related to the replacement equity awards described above.

The Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). This requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
measured at fair value. The Company estimated, using Level 3 inputs, the fair value of fixed assets using a
combination of the cost approach and the market approach.

Specific to intangible assets, trade names and developed technology were valued using the relief from
royalty method, a variation of the income approach, and customer relationships and maintenance agreements were
valued based on the multi- period excess earnings method of the income approach.

The Company has recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of
the purchase date (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue
recognition policy). The allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Citrix as of September 30, 2022 is as
follows (in thousands);

$ 11,630,000

**4.** **Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments**

**_Investments_**

**_Equity Securities Accounted for at Net Asset Value_**

The Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $11.9 million and $13.0 million as of
February 28, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively, which are accounted for under the net asset value practical
expedient per the guidance. These investments are included in Other assets in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets. The net asset value of these investments is determined using quarterly capital
statements from the funds, which are based on the Company’s contributions to the funds, allocation of profit and
loss and changes in fair value of the underlying fund investments. These private equity funds focus on making
venture capital investments, principally by investing in equity securities of early and late stage privately held
corporations. The funds’ general partner shall determine the amount, timing and form (whether cash or in kind) of
all distributions made by the funds. The Company may only transfer its investments in private equity fund interests


-----

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

subject to the general partner’s written consent and cannot trade its fund interests in established securities markets,
secondary markets or equivalents thereof. The Company had no unfunded commitments as of February 28, 2024.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

FASB guidance for fair value measurements clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the
guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
(Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in
active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is
little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use
observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair
value. On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including foreign
currency contracts.

We execute foreign currency contracts primarily in the retail market in an over-the-counter environment
with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large multi-national and
regional banks. The foreign currency contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing
intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the three months ended February 28,
2024 and 2023.

**_Derivative Instruments_**

We conduct business in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific and
Japan (“APJ”). As a result, the financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or changes in economic conditions in foreign markets. The U.S. dollar is the major transaction
currency; we also transact business in approximately thirty-six foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most
significant to operations are the Euro, British pound, and Indian rupee. Derivative instruments are recognized as
either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are initially reported as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income and (loss) and are subsequently recognized in income
when the hedged exposure is recognized in income. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that
are not designated as hedges are recognized in Other expense, net. The total cumulative unrealized gain on cash flow
derivative instruments was $4.4 million as of February 28, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
derivatives are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income and (loss) in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gain as of February 28, 2024 is expected to be recognized in
income over the next 12 months at the same time the hedged items are recognized in income.

We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage currency exposure related to variable
cash flows of forecasted foreign currency expenses, and these forward contracts are generally settled within twelve
months from trade dates. Our forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate
movements. For those contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized currently in Other
expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements or other instruments to manage our interest
rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on our debt. We may choose whether or not to
designate these contracts as hedges. The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the net cash settlements on the
swaps are recorded each period within Interest expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of


-----

Operations. See Note 6 “Debt and Credit Facilities” to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on our interest rate swap agreements.

**_Senior First Lien Credit Agreement_**

On September 30, 2022, Cloud Software Group and Parent (collectively, the “Borrowers”), Holdings, and
Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time
(“Senior First Lien Lenders”) entered into the Credit Agreement (the “Senior First Lien Credit Agreement”) in the
form of term loans comprised of three tranches, a term loan A with a principal amount of $2,502.5 million (the
“Term Loan A”), a dollar term loan B with a principal amount of $4,050.0 million (the “Initial Dollar Term Loan
B”), and a Euro term loan B with a principal amount of EUR500.0 million (the “Initial Euro Term Loan B”). In
addition, certain Senior First Lien Lenders extended revolving loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in a principal
amount of not more than the Dollar equivalent of $1,000.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn as of
February 28, 2024.

These funds, together with the proceeds of the Bridge Loan (as defined below) and the First Lien Notes (as
defined below), were used, among other things, to repay the outstanding loans under previously existing loan
agreements including the (i) Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated November 26, 2019 with Citrix as the
borrower, (ii) the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated January 21, 2020, with Citrix as the borrower, (iii) the Term
Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of February 5, 2021, with Citrix as the borrower, (iv) the Senior Secured Credit
Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2014, with Cloud Software Group as the borrower, and (v) the Senior Secured
Second Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of March 4, 2020, with Cloud Software Group as the borrower
(collectively, the “Existing Credit Agreements”). These funds were also used to redeem and/or offer to repurchase
Citrix’s 1.250% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Citrix 2026 Notes”), Citrix’s 4.500% Senior Notes due 2027 (the
“2027 Rollover Notes”), and Citrix’s 3.300% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Citrix 2030 Notes” and, together with the
Citrix 2026 Notes and the 2027 Rollover Notes, the “Citrix Notes”). The Citrix 2026 Notes and the Citrix 2030
Notes were redeemed in full in connection with the Merger. As of February 28, 2024, there is still a remaining
balance on the 2027 Rollover Notes of $112.4 million.

On January 27, 2023, the Borrowers, Holdings and the other parties thereto entered into an amendment to
the Senior First Lien Credit Agreement whereby the Borrowers (i) incurred incremental first lien term loans
denominated in EUR in a principal amount of EUR250 million consisting of a new tranche of term B loans (the
“Incremental EUR Term Loan B”) and (ii) used the proceeds of the Incremental EUR Term Loan B to repurchase
(and subsequently cancel) outstanding loans under the Term Loan A in a principal amount of approximately $271.4
million.

The Incremental EUR Term Loan B has the same maturity date, amortization and interest rate applicable to
the Initial Euro Term Loan B.

On November 22, 2023, the Borrowers, Holdings and the other parties thereto entered into a second
amendment to the Senior First Lien Credit Agreement, whereby the Borrowers incurred incremental first lien term
loans denominated in U.S. dollars in a principal amount of $1,000.0 million (the “Incremental Term Loan B” and,
together with the Initial Dollar Term Loan B, the “Dollar Term Loan B-1”).

The Incremental Term Loan B has the same maturity date and interest rate applicable to the Initial Dollar
Term Loan B, and as of the fiscal quarter ending November 30, 2023, the Incremental Term Loan B has the same
amortization applicable to the Initial Dollar Term Loan B.

guarantee Cloud Software Group’s obligations, under the Senior First Lien Credit Agreement. The First Lien Notes
are secured by first-priority liens on the collateral, which consists of substantially all of the assets that secure the
obligations of Cloud Software Group and the guarantors under the Senior First Lien Credit Agreement (the
“Collateral”), ratably on a pari passu basis.

For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized interest expense of $69.4 million related to

Notes as of February 28, 2024 is 9.6% per annum. Interest on the Second Lien Notes is due semi-annually on March
31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2023. The Second Lien Notes will mature on

**_2027 Rollover Notes_**

In connection with the Merger, Citrix offered to repurchase the 2027 Rollover Notes. Following closing of
the repurchase offer, $112.4 million of 2027 Rollover Notes remained outstanding. The 2027 Rollover Notes accrue
interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Interest on the 2027 Rollover Notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and

Lien Bridge Credit Agreement comprised of a term loan with a principal amount of approximately $3,837.6 million
(the “Bridge Loan”).

On April 10, 2023, we closed our private offering of $3,837.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

**_Interest Rate Swap_**

On April 4, 2023, and May 2, 2023, we executed interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of obtaining
a fixed USD SOFR CME Term interest rate (our elected alternate base rate for Term Loan A) ranging from 3.485%
to 3.654% on $2,000.0 million of the aggregate term loans and notes. The swap agreements terminate on March 31,
2028. For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recorded a gain of $3.3 million.

**_Bank Guarantee, Letter of Credit and Restricted Cash_**

Issued bank guarantees were approximately $3.7 million as of February 28, 2024, and are collateralized by
pledging the equivalent amount under restricted cash as required under a guarantee credit line. Various other
contractual commitments also require us to issue letters of credit and pledge cash as security and record this cash
under restricted cash. As of February 28, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had restricted cash of $13.3 million and
$13.7 million, respectively, which is included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**7.** **Accrued Restructuring Costs**

As a part of integration efforts related to recent acquisitions, we are executing restructuring efforts intended
to improve operational efficiency. The restructuring includes, among other things, the ongoing reorganization of our
business operations and our ongoing expense re-alignment efforts. For the three months ended February 28, 2024
and 2023, restructuring charges of $54.3 million and $126.8 million, respectively, were primarily related to
severance for employee terminations, excess facilities and other corporate actions aimed at increasing efficiencies
and reducing redundancy costs.

The following table summarizes the significant activities within, and components of, the restructuring
liabilities (in thousands):

**Accrued** **Accrued**
**Facilities** **Severance and**
**Restructuring** **Other** **Total**

Balance as of November 30, 2023 .................................. $ 10,453 $ 18,006 $ 28,459

Long-term accrued restructuring costs ........................... $ 4,451 $ — $ 4,451

We review our impairment of long-lived assets, including ROU assets, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. Measurement of an impairment loss
is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value of the ROU assets is determined
by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets.

We re-evaluated our real estate needs, resulting in a reduction of owned space and leased space, and the
impairment of the associated ROU assets and property and equipment. Due to the actions taken, we tested the
operating lease ROU assets and certain property and equipment for recoverability by comparing the carrying value
of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset group. Based on the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the undiscounted
cash flows of the asset groups were below the carrying values, indicating impairment. We then determined the fair
value of the asset groups by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets.
For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized $1.6 million which primarily consisted of
depreciation expense for property and equipment and ROU lease impairment charges which were recorded as
Restructuring charges on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

**8.** **Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Letters of Credit_**

As of February 28, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had a total of $0.4 million and $0.6 million,
respectively, outstanding with respect to letters of credit in connection with customer contracts and facility lease
transactions.

As of February 28, 2024, contractual commitments associated with indebtedness and lease obligations are
as follows (fiscal years, and in thousands):

(1) Assumes SOFR at 5.3%. and EURIBOR at 3.9%.

The above commitment table does not include long-term uncertain income tax liabilities due to the fact that
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments.

**_Indemnifications_**

Our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual
property infringement claims. To date, no such claims have been filed against us. We also warrant to customers that
software products operate substantially in accordance with the software product’s specifications. Historically, we
have incurred minimal costs related to product warranties, and, as such, no accruals for warranty costs have been
made. In addition, we indemnify our officers and directors under the terms of indemnity agreements entered into
with them, as well as pursuant to our organizational documents and applicable Delaware law.

**9.** **Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are involved in or subject to legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings,
claims, demands and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or
against us with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought
against our customers for whom we have a contractual indemnification obligation. We accrue for a liability when it
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant
judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is
reasonably estimable. After we determine the probability of a loss and whether that loss is reasonably estimable, we
then analyze whether the litigation, based on that determination, could have a material and adverse effect on our
financial statements, taken as a whole and including our statement of cash flows. The accruals or estimates, if any,
resulting from the foregoing analysis, are reviewed at least quarterly, and adjusted to reflect the impact of
negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular
matter. To the extent that it is probable and reasonably estimable that the losses could exceed the amounts already
accrued, we will, as applicable, adjust the accrual in the period the determination is made, disclose an estimate of the
additional loss or range of loss, indicate that the estimate is immaterial with respect to our financial statements as a
whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate cannot be
made.

Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters, the Company believes that
outcomes that may materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows
are reasonably possible but not estimable at this time.

**_Securities Class Action_**

On November 19, 2021, a Citrix shareholder filed a putative securities class action complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming Citrix and certain of its current and former officers
and directors as individual defendants, and claiming to have purchased Citrix stock at artificially inflated prices
during the period between January 22, 2020, and October 6, 2021 and suffered damages as a result of alleged
violations of federal securities law. On April 22, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, naming the same
defendants and alleging substantially similar securities violations as the original complaint, including violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b5, promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly false or misleading statements regarding Citrix’s transition from
selling on-premises, perpetual licenses to cloud-based subscriptions. The amended complaint seeks, among other
things, an award of compensatory damages and the Plaintiffs’ reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’
fees, experts’ fees, and other costs and disbursements. In January 2023, the Court granted Citrix’s motion to dismiss
the case in its entirety. On August 8, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the dismissal.
Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 6, 2023,
Appellants filed a Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice. On December 12, 2023, the Court dismissed the case.

**_Legal Proceedings Related to the Merger_**

**_Messiha and Vargas v. Citrix Systems, Inc., et al._**

On December 12, 2022, Juan Vargas, a purported Citrix shareholder, filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Citrix and its former Board of Directors. The Complaint
alleges that Citrix’s Board of Directors used false projections to conceal the true value of Citrix from Citrix
shareholders, and thereby secure the approval of Citrix’s shareholders to sell Citrix to Vista Equity Partners and
Elliott Investment Management L.P. for an inadequate and unfair price. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of the use of
such projections, the Definitive Proxy Statement filed in connection with the Merger omitted material information,
rendering the Definitive Proxy Statement false and misleading. Plaintiff alleges that Citrix and the individual
defendants violated Sections 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Plaintiff also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary
damages.Citrix has put its carrier on notice of this suit as a related claim to the sale related litigation matters. On
February 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act. No other plaintiffs filed competing motions, and on March 8, 2023, the judge appointed Juan Vargas
and George Messiha as lead plaintiffs. In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and Citrix filed its
motion to dismiss the complaint in July 2023. The Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on January
25, 2024 and issued its order on February 3, 2024, granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The Court
dismissed the majority of alleged misstatements and omissions, but denied the motion as to certain alleged
omissions from the Proxy Statement. Citrix filed its answer to the amended complaint, and the parties currently are
engaged in discovery. The Company believes that Citrix and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to these
allegations; however, the Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of this matter or the
potential exposure or loss, if any.

**_Books and Records Demands_**

Citrix received demand letters pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(“DGCL”) from stockholders seeking disclosure of certain of Citrix’s records relating to the Merger. Citrix
responded to those demands, stating its belief that the demand letters fail to fully comply with the requirements of
Section 220 of the DGCL. On April 20, 2022, two stockholders filed a complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court
captioned Liebenthal, et al. v. Citrix Systems, Inc., C.A. No. 2022-0349, seeking to compel inspection of books and
records pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL. Citrix produced certain materials related to the request, including
redacted board meeting minutes.On March 7, 2023, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action. It is still possible
that Plaintiffs could file a breach of fiduciary duty or similar action in Delaware. The statute of limitations for
fiduciary duty claims is three years.

**_Legorreta, et al. v. Calderoni_**

A class action complaint was filed on February 19, 2024, in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a law firm
that obtained documents from Citrix through a Section 220 books and records demand in 2022 and 2023 (see
description of Books and Records Demands, above). The complaint alleges a single claim, for breach of fiduciary
duty against former Citrix Chairman and CEO Robert Calderoni, in connection with the Merger. The complaint
alleges that Mr. Calderoni breached his fiduciary duties by approving the proxy statement sent to shareholders
soliciting approval of the Merger that was allegedly misleading and by not securing a higher purchase price for
Citrix shares. The Company believes that the defendant has meritorious defenses to these allegations; however, the
Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential exposure or loss, if
any.

**_Consumer Class Actions Arising from NetScaler Security Vulnerability_**

On October 10, 2023, the Company published a notice identifying a vulnerability in its on-premises
NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway products (CVE-2023-4966) and simultaneously released a software patch to
NetScaler users to remedy the vulnerability. Starting on December 19, 2023, twenty-one nationwide putative class
action lawsuits were filed against Citrix alleging various state law claims based on data breach incidents experienced
by Company customers, where such incidents allegedly arose from exploits of CVE-2023-4966 (collectively, the
“CVE-2023-4966 Class Actions”). Of the original twenty-one cases filed, six have been dismissed by the plaintiffs,
leaving fifteen cases pending as of April 9, 2024.

**_The Comcast Cases_**

On December 18, 2023, Citrix customer Comcast Cable Communications, d/b/a Xfinity (“Comcast”) sent
customers a notice stating that, between October 16, 2023 and October 19, 2023, before Comcast applied the patch
to fix the CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability, Comcast experienced a data breach that it concluded was a result of the
CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability. Following the Comcast December 18, 2023 announcement, plaintiffs filed eighteen
putative class action lawsuits against Citrix in three different district courts (S.D. Florida, E.D. Pennsylvania, and
South Carolina), asserting claims for negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, unjust enrichment, and other state law claims, based on
Comcast’s identification of CVE-2023-4966 in connection with Comcast’s data breach. Each of the cases has either
been transferred to the E.D. Pennsylvania (where Comcast is headquartered) or dismissed. There are fifteen
complaints pending in the E.D. Pennsylvania concerning the Comcast data breach; all fifteen cases have been
consolidated by the Court. Five different plaintiffs’ counsel filed applications for appointment as interim lead class
counsel for the consolidated cases. The Court set a hearing on those applications for May 14, 2024. The foregoing
cases, most of which include Comcast as a co-defendant, are referred to here as the “Comcast Data Breach Actions”.
The majority of complaints in the now-consolidated Comcast Data Breach Actions erroneously allege that Citrix had
possession of the Comcast customer data at the time of the breach. Once interim lead plaintiffs’ counsel is selected,
plaintiffs’ counsel will file a consolidated complaint and the Company may then file a motion to dismiss.

**_Non-Comcast Cases_**

On February 16, 2024, a plaintiff filed Cole v. Planet Home Lending, LLC & Citrix Systems, Inc., Case
0:24-cv-60269 (S.D. Florida) naming Citrix as a co-defendant in connection with a data breach experienced by
Planet Home Lending on November 15, 2023 and which, according to news articles, impacted approximately
200,000 individuals. Relying on alleged facts substantively similar to those in the Comcast Data Breach Actions, the
Cole complaint alleges claims for negligence, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against Citrix. On April
18, 2024, the plaintiff dismissed the complaint with prejudice.

On January 7, 2024, a plaintiff’s counsel, who originally filed a complaint on December 19, 2023, in the
Southern District of Florida against Citrix and Comcast, amended the complaint to name a new plaintiff as the class
representative for the putative class action, substituted Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“FHCC”) in place of
Comcast as a defendant, and revised the complaint to allege claims arising from a customer data breach announced
by FHCC on December 28, 2023, on the basis that FHCC stated on its website that the actors who exfiltrated the


-----

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

FHCC customer data “exploited a vulnerability in a software called Citrix”. The amended complaint was captioned
as Paves v. Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Paves”) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Case No. 0:23-cv-62375 (S.D.
Florida). Citrix was dismissed with prejudice by Paves on February 6, 2024.

Two additional putative class action lawsuits filed against Citrix in January 2024 (Dailey v. Citrix Systems.
Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case No. 0:24-cv-60038-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Daily”) and Newell v. Citrix Systems,
Inc., Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case 0:24-cv-60048-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Newell”)
erroneously alleged that CVE-2023-4966 had a role in a data breach experienced by LoanCare. Following a clear
communication from LoanCare to the plaintiffs that Citrix products had no role in the data breach, the plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed both the Newell and Dailey case without prejudice on January 30, 2024.

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in all of the CVE-2023-4966 Class
Actions; however, the Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of these matters or the
potential exposure or loss, if any.

**10. Related Party Transactions**

We have transactions with various other portfolio companies of VEP and Elliott in the ordinary course of
business. Such activity for the three months ended February 28, 2024 and 2023 was not material. VEP provides us
with certain management consulting services. We reimburse VEP for any out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, we
have utilized Vista Consulting Group (“VCG”), the operating and consulting arm of VEP, for consulting services
and paid to VCG related fees and expenses. Such activity for each of the three months ended February 28, 2024 and
2023 were not material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the three months ended February 28, 2024, we paid Holdco dividends of $65.9 million in cash that
was used primarily to pay cash dividends to holders of the Series A Preferred Shares of Holdco.

**11. Stock-Based Compensation**

**_2022 Incentive Plan_**

The Board of Holdco adopted the Picard Holdco, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended to date, the
“Equity Plan”). The Equity Plan authorizes the issuance of up to an aggregate of 671,646 shares of common stock in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other stock
based awards. The awards settle into Picard Holdco,Inc. equity. These awards may be granted to officers, employees
and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

**_Stock Options_**

Stock option incentive service awards vest over four years with 25% vesting after 12 months and an
additional 6.25% vest at the end of each full three calendar month period thereafter. If the employee is, and has
been, continuously employed by the Company through the date of consummation of an approved sale, any incentive
service awards which were unvested incentive service awards immediately prior to such approved sale are deemed
vested units. Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the incentive service units during the three months
ended February 28, 2024 and three months ended February 28, 2023 was $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested incentive service stock option awards
is $29.7 million as of February 28, 2024 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.65
years.

Stock option incentive performance awards vest in tranches of 50% upon consummation of a change in
control or IPO if the total equity return multiple is equal or greater than 2.0x and the remaining 50% upon a 2.5x
attained multiple and if the employee has been employed continuously at the consummation of such an event. All
incentive performance awards that are not vested as of the consummation of an approved sale shall terminate and be
of no value as of the consummation of such approved sale. Since a liquidity event is a contingent event and not

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

considered probable until the event occurs, no compensation expense for the incentive performance units was
recognized for the three months ended February 28, 2024. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation
expense related to the unvested incentive performance stock option awards is $45.2 million as of February 28, 2024.

These stock option incentive awards are primarily equity-classified awards as there is no requirement for
cash settlement and they are only settled in shares that require a hold period of at least six months passing the risk of
ownership to the option holder. The value of these equity classified stock option incentive awards is determinable as
of the grant date. There is a portion of stock option incentive service units that are liability-classified given they
contain an unrestricted put option at the option holder’s discretion at specified periods after the anniversary of the
grant date.

The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option incentive awards using the Black-Scholes
valuation model, whereby the allocable equity value of the Company is divided by the fully diluted shares to
calculate the fair value of the underlying common stock. The stock volatility for each grant is estimated from the
historical daily price changes of comparable companies. The expected term of options granted is derived from the
weighted average of estimated time to fully vesting of the incentive performance stock awards through a vesting
event and the contractual life of the award, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods aligns with the expected life of the option is based on the Daily U.S.
Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the
Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.

There were no grants issued during the three months ended February 28, 2024. The weighted average grant
date fair value of stock options issued for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was $262.82, respectively.


**_Restricted Stock Units_**

During the three months ended February 28, 2024, we granted no new restricted stock units (“RSUs”)
under the Equity Plan. As of February 28, 2024, 7,693 units were forfeited due to employee terminations. Upon
forfeiture, the forfeited units were cancelled, returned to the pool, and are available for future distribution. Stockbased compensation expense recognized for RSUs for the three months ended February 28, 2024 was $6.1 million.
The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs is $87.9 million as of February
28, 2024 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.

Restricted stock unit activity during the year ended February 28, 2024 was as follows:

**_Cash Conversion_**

All legacy Citrix stock compensation related plans were terminated concurrently with the Merger on
September 30, 2022. Per the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 30, 2022, by and between Cloud
Software Group, Holdco,TIBCO Merger Sub, Inc., and Balboa Holdings LP (the “Agreement and Plan of Merger”),
all vested awards that were outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the acquisition were canceled, retired,
and ceased to exist and were converted into the right to receive cash at an amount equal to the per share merger
consideration, less any applicable exercise price. Subsequent to the closing of the Merger and before November 30,
2022, the Company paid approximately $90.4 million in cash for the vested stock awards and applicable taxes.

Per the Agreement and Plan of Merger, all unvested awards that were outstanding as of immediately prior
to the acquisition were canceled, retired, and ceased to exist and converted into the right to receive cash (“cash
awards”) over the original respective vesting schedule at an amount equal to the per share merger consideration, less
any applicable exercise price. The payments are conditional upon the employees’ continued employment with the
Company and any additional expense is recorded consistent with the cost center mapping for each employee on the
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. A liability of approximately $113.0 million related to the cash
awards was assumed as part of the Merger with the remainder of the expense to be recognized over the course of the
original vesting schedule. Any forfeitures of these awards will be recognized as incurred.

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

We recorded approximately $75.3 million in expenses in the period after the Merger and before November
30, 2022. Of that amount, $35.7 million was expensed related to the vesting of awards paid out immediately upon
the close of the Merger. The remaining $39.6 million was expensed related to the vesting of cash awards during the
period after the Merger and before November 30, 2022. For the three months ended February 28, 2024, the
Company recorded approximately $10.4 million in expenses. For the three months ended February 28, 2023, the
Company recorded approximately $56.3 million in expenses. As of February 28, 2024, there was $5.5 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards. The unrecognized cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.2 years.

**_Stock Compensation Expense_**

The detail of the total stock-based compensation recognized by income statement classification is as
follows (in thousands):

**Three Months Ended February 28,**
**2024** **2023**
Cost of revenue .................................................................................... $ 1,318 $ 4,555
Research and development .................................................................. 9,405 19,144
Sales and marketing ............................................................................. 4,869 21,439
General and administrative .................................................................. 3,774 13,551
Total stock-based compensation expense ...................................... $ 19,366 $ 58,689

**12. Income Taxes**

The Company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part
of the process of preparing its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company maintains certain
strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at rates
that are generally lower than in the United States. The Company’s effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S.
federal statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on earnings generated by our foreign operations that are taxed
primarily in Switzerland and Ireland.

For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized an effective tax rate of approximately
(24.3)% and net tax expense of $9.05 million. During the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized a
discrete tax expense of $10.4 million, primarily due to a change in tax reserves of $6.7 million. The negative
effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2024, was primarily due to a valuation allowance against
the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation.

For the three months ended February 28, 2023, we recognized an effective tax rate of approximately (5.6)%
and net tax expense of $32.7 million. During the three months ended February 28, 2023, we recognized a discrete
tax expense of $115.7 million, primarily due to a $120.3 million tax expense related to the valuation allowance
against the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation, offset by $4.6 million tax benefit related to change in tax
reserves. The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023, was primarily due to the
expense related to the valuation allowance against the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation.

The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $225.6 million and $225.7 million as of February
28, 2024 and February 28, 2023, respectively. As of February 28, 2024, $208.4 million included in the balance for
tax positions would affect the annual effective tax rate if realized. The Company recognizes interest accrued related
to uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax expense. As of February 28, 2024, the Company accrued $29.7
million for the payment of interest.

The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income taxes in the United
States, as well as income taxes of multiple multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Specifically, Citrix Systems, Inc.
is currently under examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2017 through 2018. With
few exceptions, the Company is generally not subject to examination for state and local income tax, or in non-U.S.

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)**

jurisdictions by tax authorities for years prior to 2018. The statute of limitations for fiscal years 2015 through 2023
remains open for material foreign tax jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty of tax audit outcomes and the timing of
tax audit settlements, we are unable to estimate the changes to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve
months.

**13. Subsequent Events**

We have evaluated subsequent events and transactions through May 7, 2024, the day financial statements
were available to be issued, and noted no events or transactions that would require recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements other than the following:

On March 22, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement governing the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) whereby the Company incurred incremental
first lien term loans denominated in USD in a principal amount of $1,000.0 million consisting of a new tranche of
term B loans (the “Dollar Term Loan B-2”). The Company used the proceeds of the loans to pay dividends to
Holdco in an aggregate amount of $457.4 million, which dividends were used by Holdco to repurchase $411.4
million of the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock and pay $46.0 million of accrued and unpaid dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, with the remainder to be
used for general corporate purposes.

The Dollar Term Loan B-2 matures on March 21, 2031. Principal payments are equal to 0.25% of the initial
aggregate principal amount, payable at the end of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending
November 30, 2024.

The Dollar Term Loan B-2 has the same interest rate applicable to the Dollar Term Loan B-1.
