In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering circular as legal, business or tax advice. ----- Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations. Each prospective investor must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells Notes or possesses or distributes this offering circular and must obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and none of we, the initial purchasers or their representative shall have any responsibility therefor. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated dealer quotation system. The Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited with the registrar, as custodian for DTC as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee of such depositary. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. After the initial issuance of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited circumstances set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.” The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and the Issuer and the initial purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Issuer and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to allot to you less than the full amount of Notes sought by you. The initial purchasers and certain related entities may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes. In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Any of these transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market prices of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"Cloud Software was created in September 2022 by the combination of Citrix and TIBCO, two leading global enterprise-focused software businesses. The combination has created a portfolio of companies under the management of Cloud Software, which we believe positions us to become one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing comprehensive, secure and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our collective capabilities help our customers advance their hybrid cloud information technology (“IT”) strategies and meet the needs of the modern enterprise. The combination of Citrix’s and TIBCO’s product portfolios allows us to offer solutions to address organizations’ most complex use-cases, serve as a centralized vendor for senior IT buyers within large enterprises and leverage an array of go-to-market (“GTM”) capabilities for our buyer and customer bases. Since the combination, we have realized significant operational improvements and expect to pursue additional opportunities in the near-term to drive further cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies. We believe that our management team’s track record of identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions positions Cloud Software to capitalize on further enterprise software market consolidation. We serve large and mission-critical software markets. Based on our estimates, our total addressable market (“TAM”) was approximately $70 billion as of 2023 with an expected compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 15% from 2023 to 2027. We currently serve over 145,000 active customers in over 150 countries, covering 84% of the Fortune 500, including over 650 customers who had more than $1 million in ARR as of February 28, 2024. Our highly tenured customer base includes some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world and span major industry verticals, including healthcare, financial services, technology, transportation, energy, manufacturing, telecommunications, business services, consumer and government agencies and others. Notable customers include Airbus, Bayer, Biogen, Centene, conEdison, Deloitte, eBay, Goya, JetBlue, Pepsi and Siemens. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, we had a Net Retention Rate (“NRR”) of 105% and a Gross Retention Rate (“GRR”) of 88% for our core platform brands, Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO (including ibi).

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Operating Strategy,9.2.1,,"Cloud Software’s mission is to create long-term value for all stakeholders by delivering mission-critical solutions via a subscription-based revenue model. We intend to continue driving industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA ----- and Adjusted EBITDA margins through improved cost structures and efficiencies and leveraging cash flow to invest in innovation organically and through acquisitions. Since TIBCO’s acquisition by Vista in 2014 and the Merger in 2022, we have undergone significant product and financial transformation. From a product perspective, we have invested in modern cloud platforms that can offer enhanced simplicity, user experiences and optimized cost of ownership. In addition, we have transitioned our customers from perpetual licenses to subscription contracts at an accelerated pace where 86% of our ARR is now subscription-based compared to 68% same time last year, which has resulted in increased revenue predictability and higher lifetime value from customers. We typically benefit from expansion in average spend when customers migrate from license to subscription contracts, and believe the ongoing transition will continue to drive growth. Led by CEO Tom Krause, our strategy is to focus on high-quality, sustainable ARR while driving industry leading EBITDA. We achieve those results by: - maintaining a rigorous and disciplined approach to investment; - critical examination of our products to determine core value propositions; - investment to deliver highly innovative and competitive solutions to our customers; - a focus on renewals and expansion within our existing customer base; - divestiture of assets that are not conducive to long-term favorable results in our model; and - highly efficient and scalable corporate functions that support our businesses. We build or buy technology to enhance our businesses’ core products. We anticipate acquiring additional businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to customers and are good fits to operate within our model. Our Further Adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded from approximately 49% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2023 to approximately 65% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, due to increased focus on subscription-based revenue streams and greater cost structure focus. Prior to the end of calendar year 2022, we completed an exhaustive strategic review that included scrutiny on headcount and program expense, existing product viability and future product and feature opportunities, engineering strengths and weaknesses, compensation programs, sales motions, GTM strategies, marketing strategies and customer profiles. As a result of this strategic review, we now go to market under seven portfolio Company brands: Citrix, NetScaler (as a brand of Citrix), TIBCO, ibi (as a brand of TIBCO), ShareFile, NetScaler eCommerce, Spotfire, Jaspersoft, and XenServer. We have coalesced our strategy around these brands to: - allow focus by those brands on core value propositions with increased innovation investment; - create significant cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies; - drive accountability in each business; and - leverage increased cash flow to allow debt repayment and future acquisitions. Our core platform brands are Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO (including ibi). These three brands collectively generated $4,003 million of ARR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, representing 90.5% of our total ----- ARR for that period. These core platforms had a Net Retention Rate (“NRR”) of 105% and a Gross Retention Rate (“GRR”) of 88% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The new subscription contract programs bring the suite of Citrix capabilities, including VDI, DaaS, Application Delivery Control (“ADC”), Zero Trust, Observability and others, together in a single subscription contract. For customers, these changes: - consolidate and optimize costs; - protect business-critical applications and data; - reduce operational complexity; and - improve user experience. Effectively, the unified subscription contract model gives customers entitlements to all capabilities, delivering greater value. For Citrix, the new subscription contract programs simplify our sale process by consolidating the suite of capabilities into a single subscription contract, and our back-end operations by reducing the number of SKUs we manage. Citrix goes to market directly and through partners, depending on customer ARR. Our largest customers have assigned account executives and often receive support from large systems integrators partnered with Citrix. Customers below a certain ARR level are serviced by resellers and distributors.  Sales to all their customer tiers are outsourced to partners in the three following regions: Latin America (excluding Brazil), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) and emerging markets (Middle East and Africa). Meaningful Citrix competitors include certain offerings from Omnissa (formerly operating as VMware’s End-User Computing Division), Microsoft, AWS and Google. _Technology Relationships_ ----- Citrix’s most important technology relationship is with Microsoft, a relationship that has for over 30 years spanned product development, GTM initiatives and channel partner development. This has provided mutual customers secure, high-performance delivery of applications, desktops and data to their employees. In April 2024, Citrix and Microsoft extended their strategic partnership for an additional eight years. The renewed strategic partnership includes a focus on the development of new cloud and AI solutions with an integrated Citrix / Microsoft product roadmap, allowing Citrix the opportunity to enhance the value of Citrix software as well as contribute to Microsoft AVD. Specifically, Citrix will be the preferred Microsoft Global Azure Partner solution for Enterprise Desktop-as-a-Service when collaborating with joint Azure customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We have started to build on some of the best technologies and products from our portfolio, leveraging our expertise of our best-in-class engineers and product experts. We are heavily focused on efficiently developing innovative new offerings that leverage capabilities across both portfolios and deliver incremental value to customers. - **_Deeper understanding of customer needs and market trends – We leverage our deep understanding of customer needs and market trends to focus innovation efforts on the most value-enhancing areas, benefitting from our broad portfolio to align innovation efforts with industry growth drivers. We currently serve over 145,000 active customers in over 150 countries, providing expansive relationships and insight into customer needs. We are a leader in both work solutions and in application integration, data management, business intelligence and analytics and our leadership team provides extensive insight into market trends. - **_Continuing transition towards recurring revenue and subscription models – We are focused on further strengthening our recurring business model, including transitioning customers to subscription contracts. Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Mix, which represents the percentage of Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue, divided by Non-GAAP Revenue, was 96% for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, increasing from 92% for fiscal 2022. The Citrix business unit, which contributed approximately 72% of ARR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, has over 50 million users, with 80% of those being subscription contract users, compared to 50% for the previous twelve months. Our SaaS contracts are generally sold as three-year subscriptions. With a 105% NRR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from increased lifetime value. We will deliver our products via subscription. To that end, we have changed our licensing options for Citrix and NetScaler. For TIBCO, the evolution to a subscription model is a continuation of a process that had already begun. The changes to both Citrix and NetScaler offerings greatly simplify the licensing process, allowing customers to buy one subscription contract for Citrix and/or one subscription contract for NetScaler and accommodate all the variations, namely: “hybrid deployment,” “cloud deployment,” and “on premise.” On March 8, 2023, we announced ----- our new “Citrix Universal Subscription,” which replaces our former “DaaS + Hybrid Rights” offering. Importantly, this new subscription contract program has no restrictions on how a customer can deploy Citrix or where they host their workloads. Further, under the new subscription contract program, we no longer offer the sale of a longtime perpetual software maintenance service. However, existing and active maintenance contracts will be honored until their relevant expiration dates. With “Citrix Universal Subscription,” customers have the freedom to use Citrix Virtual Application and Desktop management infrastructure on-premises, deploy the infrastructure on a public cloud of their choice, and/or leverage our Citrix cloud services control plane in any combination. We believe this flexibility is unmatched in the industry and well suited for this era of hybrid, distributed workforces. “Citrix Universal Subscription” delivers the greatest flexibility, our most feature-rich solution, and best support experience. Also on March 8, 2023, NetScaler launched a new and simplified program for NetScaler ADC called “NetScaler Subscription.” This subscription subscription contract model: (i) simplifies packaging to reduce confusion and minimize purchase friction; (ii) aligns NetScaler ADC hardware and software pricing for consistency and price parity; (iii) gives predictable annual operational expenses; and (iv) reduces barriers to entry by eliminating minimum order quantities for software pools and removing need for NetScaler ADM as a licensing server. As part of this announcement, we ended the sale of all perpetually licensed NetScaler ADC MPX/SDX hardware and VPX/BLX software. The end of perpetual licensing does not indicate the discontinuation of product and/or support for existing customers. All existing active maintenance contracts will be honored until their relevant expiration dates. - **_Focusing on cost savings targets and prioritizing operating efficiency – We place a rigorous focus on operational efficiency to create meaningful value. We also continue to place a strong focus on achieving the near-term cost savings targets and on prioritizing operating efficiency over the long-term to drive meaningful value creation. These initiatives are being executed by a dedicated implementation team led by management along with sponsor operational executives and third-party resources with extensive experience integrating businesses. To the extent that we pursue further acquisitions, we believe our focus on operating efficiency and deep experience integrating acquisitions will be a key value driver.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Industry Overview,9.6.1,,"- **_Virtualization (VDI & DaaS) – Virtualization allows enterprises to manage large numbers of desktops in a virtualized server environment allowing companies to better utilize servers based on demand and usage. All the data resides in servers in either on-premises data centers or in the cloud. VDI is the hosting of desktop environments on a central server. DaaS solutions provide a virtualized desktop or Windows application experience to workers, entirely from a remote hosted location such as the public cloud. DaaS eliminates the need for businesses to purchase the physical infrastructure associated with VDI or server-based computing, instead functioning through subscription- and usage-based payment structures. According to our estimates based on Gartner research, worldwide end user spending for the Virtualization Infrastructure Software market is $9.1 billion as of 2023, growing at a 2023 - 2027 CAGR of 7% to $11.7 billion.[(2)] Other key players in the VCC market include AWS, Microsoft Azure and Omnissa (formerly operating as VMware’s End-User Computing division) - **_App Delivery & Security – Application delivery, which includes ADCs, primarily provides security and access to applications at peak times. As computing is moving toward the cloud, software ADCs have been performing tasks that have been traditionally performed by custom-built hardware. ADCs also offer additional functionalities and flexibility for application deployment. These solutions help organizations quickly and securely scale up their application services based on the demand in the cloud. Traditional ADCs have been used for load balancing application servers in order to manage traffic and application deployment. However, next generation ADCs offer new functions that include security socket layer offloading, visibility, multi-cloud support, application analytics, transmission control protocol optimizations, rate shaping and web application firewalls. ADCs can be used by almost any organization that utilizes large-scale content delivery networks in order to provide fast web application (software) services and ensure high-traffic websites are secure and available to their users. They are also being used as a reverse proxy server that is placed in between web servers and the internet, removing the load from their origin servers and ensuring high availability for a seamless end-user experience. ----- Application security encompasses measures taken to improve the security of an application often by finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities. Application security systems reduce the security risks involved in the different operations of various applications, such as web and mobile applications. Key competitors in the application delivery and security market include A10 Networks, F5 Networks and Radware. - **_Integration_** **_– Nearly all business processes (e.g., procurement, asset management and customer relationship management) are evolving in such a way that application leaders increasingly must integrate diverse applications, data, events, devices and people, both within and outside of their organization. Data integration tools include tools for change data capture, extraction, transformation and loading (“ETL”), and data virtualization. Application integration tools includes tools for data consistency/synchronization, message validation, mapping, transformation, and orchestration. The primary goal for such tools is to allow data structures and applications that were designed independently to work well together. Such tools originally focused on targeted styles, such as ETL, data federation/virtualization and data replication/synchronization, but now also include message-based delivery models. Enterprise integration platform-as-a-service (“EiPaaS”) is a combination of integration technology functionalities that are delivered as a suite of cloud services and designed to support enterprise-class integration initiatives. An EiPaaS provider offers high availability, disaster recovery, security, service level agreements (“SLAs”) and technical support. It also enables users to develop and execute multiple integration scenarios by providing support for multiple personas. EiPaaS provides many of the capabilities addressed by enterprise service buses and other data integration tools, with an emphasis on addressing cloud services integration use cases, overall ease of use and SaaS-like delivery. It is used for a combination of data, multistep process and composite services integration and typically includes API management capabilities. Our Cloud Integration product, for example, provides functionality for integrating applications, data, APIs, business-to-business and internet of things, and automating processes. According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide iPaaS and data integration software end user spending was $13.0 billion, and is expected to reach $25.0 billion by 2027, representing a CAGR of 18%.[(2)] Other key players include Boomi, Informatica, Microsoft, MuleSoft, Oracle, SAP and Workato. - **_Data Management – Businesses are continuing to seek the agility afforded by a single, trusted, enterprise- wide view of master data and have turned to MDM solutions to help achieve digital acceleration goals. MDM is a technology-enabled business discipline in which business and IT work together to ensure the uniformity, accuracy, stewardship, governance, semantic consistency and accountability of an enterprise’s official shared master data assets. MDM solutions are enterprise software products that support the global identification, linking and synchronization of master data across heterogeneous data sources through reconciliation; create and manage a central, consistent system or index of record for master data; support common MDM hub implementation styles; enable generation and delivery of a trusted version of one or more data domains to all stakeholders, in support of various business initiatives; support ongoing master data stewardship and governance requirements through workflow-based monitoring and corrective-action techniques; are agnostic to the business application landscape in which they reside – that is, they do not assume or depend on the presence of any particular business application (or applications) to function because they are application neutral; and can be implemented by end-user organizations without having to make use of required professional services (i.e., not optional). According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide MDM software end user spending reached $1.6 billion and is expected to reach $2.0 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 6%.[(2)] Other key players include Ataccama, IBM, Informatica, Profisee, Reltio, Riversand, SAP, Semarchy and Stibo Systems. - **_Collaboration Solutions_** **–** Work solutions refer to business applications that foster more efficient work execution and collaboration across document, signature, functional and project-based workflows. As work becomes increasingly distributed, work solutions provide highly flexible digital channels and optimization tools to enable an intelligent digital interface which offers an integrated user experience augmented by ----- cognitive technologies such as AI, ML and advanced analytics. Work solutions provide a secure, personalized and federated view of the resources that workers require to do their jobs, including collaborators as well as applications and data, from anywhere. ShareFile provides a secure and complete platform for worker productivity and collaboration across all work scenarios. Our offerings are differentiated in that their content collaboration solutions are optimized to run in VDI & DaaS environments. Our work solutions capabilities include collaborative work management, content collaboration, workflows and automation, and e-signature. According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide Content Services end user spending reached $16.0 billion and is expected to reach $25.8 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 13%.[(3)] Other key players include Box, Dropbox, Google Cloud and Microsoft 365. - **_Data Analytics and Insights – ABI platforms are characterized by easy-to-use functionality that supports a full analytic workflow – from data preparation to visual exploration and insight generation – with an emphasis on self-service usage and augmented user assistance. ABI platforms are no longer differentiated by their data visualization capabilities, which are now commoditized. Differentiation has shifted to how well platforms support augmented analytics. Augmentation utilizes ML and AI-assisted data preparation, insight generation and insight explanation to help business people and data analysts explore and analyze data more effectively than they could manually. Rather than being a discrete capability, augmentation is now threaded through platforms as ML is applied across the data-to-decision workflow. ABI platform functionality includes cloud analytics, data source connectivity, data preparation, cataloging, automated insights, data visualization, data storytelling, natural language query, natural language generation, reporting, security and manageability. Vendors in the ABI market range from startups backed by venture capital funds to large technology firms. The vast majority of new spending in this market is on cloud deployments. Although spending on ABI is growing more slowly than in the 2010s, the number of people using ABI platforms is accelerating. According to Gartner research, in 2023, worldwide Enterprise Software Analytics* end user spending reached $31.7 billion and is expected to reach $60.8 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 18%.[(3)] Other key players include Microsoft, Oracle, Qlik, SAP, SAS, Tableau and ThoughtSpot The markets in which we operate benefit from a number of industry trends that are driving their growth and enhancing their strategic importance for customers: - **_Global Shift to Secure Hybrid Work_** **– Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid increase in remote and hybrid work, as well as the need for business continuity, has made desktop virtualization and DaaS a major priority for organizations. Remote and hybrid strategies continue to pressure digital workplace infrastructure & operations (“I&O”) leaders to measure and improve employee productivity and experience. - **_Transition to Cloud – The pandemic strained on-premises digital workplace solutions and accelerated the shift to low-touch, cloud-hosted, and internet-facing technology and services. Most I&O leaders are accelerating their investments in cloud-powered workplace technologies to deliver services to workers in any location. Agile and easy to integrate cloud solutions are essential to all types of organizations in order to reduce costs, increase flexibility, streamline operations and automate redundant processes. - **_End-User Security – Customers increasingly require solutions that help them securely and efficiently manage an increasingly complex set of end-user services. Our bundled solution allows I&O teams to focus on both priorities. - **_Expanded Attack Surface – As more and more enterprises across the world are embracing digital transformation to upgrade their network architectures, networking and security solutions have been essential. With the rise in internet traffic, business applications and the huge number of internet-enabled ----- devices, ADCs provide the front-end intelligence that supplements and enhances business applications flow. With organizations increasingly connecting to various business-critical applications via the internet, the risk of a potential breach has been continuously increasing. - **_Enterprise Integration Platform-as-a-Service – To help facilitate digital transformation, EiPaaS is one of the essential tools that organizations are using to deliver hyperautomation. Organizations are adopting EiPaaS to respond to drastic business changes, such as integration initiatives, contain costs and increase flexibility. As more organizations adopt cloud and SaaS applications to simplify their operations, vendormanaged solutions are becoming more appealing to buyers. - **_Proliferation of Data_** **– The proliferation of data, and the need for integrated insights spanning organizations, systems, and applications, necessitates I&O teams to expand IT spend further into work environments that are increasingly distributed. As businesses seek support for “360-degree view” requirements, products like MDM and ABI platforms are positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on business outcomes. - **_Proliferation of Applications – As organizations increase the number of applications deployed in their overall application infrastructure, integration becomes essential to support business agility. In order to quickly meet diverse business needs, organizations need to rapidly integrate new applications with the rest of their application portfolio which requires comprehensive API management and integration suites. - **_Need for Efficiency – As companies look to accelerate their digital strategies, the achievement of time, cost and other operational efficiencies are paramount to gaining competitive advantages from an investment in a digital transformation. By streamlining digital processes, IT vendors and managed solutions, businesses are optimizing their operations to improve workplace productivity and reduce processing times. - **_Increasingly Digitized and Interconnected World – As the global economy becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, organizations are moving toward more collaborative and efficient work environments across divisions and locations. Maintaining engagement and productivity around the globe requires I&O leaders to ensure their organizations and workstreams are streamlined and synchronized.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude certain items, such as amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, interest expense, net income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other expenses, restructuring adjustments, acquisition-related revenue adjustments, impact of change in accounting principles, non-EBITDA salaries, benefits and operating expenses, business optimization expenses, foreign exchange loss (gain), management and directors’ fees and other expenses, estimates of run-rate cost savings actioned or to be actioned in good faith, within a period of 24 months from the end of the period and annual change in unearned revenue, if positive. If the change in unearned revenue is negative, then it is recorded as zero. See “Certain Definitions” and the reconciliations below for details of how each non-GAAP metric is derived. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. Cloud Software uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate performance and to evaluate and compensate executives. Cloud Software has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because Cloud Software believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items or cash charges that are the result of discrete activities that are not used by management when evaluating Cloud Software’s historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, Cloud Software understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing Cloud Software’s financial performance to that of Cloud Software’s peer companies and competitors. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies in Cloud Software’s industry may calculate these measures differently, which may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income) and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. ----- (2) The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin to GAAP net loss for the periods presented:",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,13.1.1,"Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our market, expose us to interest rate risk, and prevent us from timely satisfying our obligations.","As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024 Transaction and this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately $17,550.1 million of total indebtedness, of which $13,712.5 million (including the Notes offered hereby) is secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral and of which $3,837.6 million is secured by second-priority liens on the Collateral. In addition, we had $1,000.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary conditions. Any borrowings under the Revolving Facility once made, would constitute senior secured indebtedness secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets, or issue equity to obtain necessary funds; we do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including: - making it more difficult for us to make payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes, the Rollover Citrix Notes, the Notes and our other obligations; - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and market conditions and to changes in the industries in which we compete; - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, future working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, future strategic business opportunities, or other general corporate requirements; - restricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures or similar transactions; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, investments, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; - limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged; and - increasing our cost of borrowing. Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. ----- Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. If we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. The Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture (as defined herein), the Second Lien Notes Indenture (as defined herein), the indenture governing the Rollover Citrix Notes (the “Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture”) and the indenture that will govern the Notes contain, or will contain, operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them. These restrictions limit, or will limit, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; - make certain investments, loans and advances; - incur certain liens; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the Issuer or the guarantors; - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and - transfer or sell assets. In addition, we and our restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain additional covenants in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We and our restricted subsidiaries are also subject to certain negative covenants in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock that impose restrictions on our business, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, make certain fundamental changes, pay dividends and make other payments, repurchases and redemptions in respect of capital stock, make investments, sell assets, change our lines of business, enter into transactions with affiliates and certain other corporate actions. Such negative covenants are subject to customary and other agreed-upon exceptions. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” The restrictions in the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture, the indenture that will govern the Notes and the documents governing the Series A Preferred Stock may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not subject to similar restrictions. We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that could subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the applicable lenders and/or amend the applicable covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default or event of default under the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture and/or the indenture that will govern the Notes, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced ----- to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and stockholders. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for additional information about the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture and the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture and “Description of the Notes” for additional information about the covenants set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and/or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are at any point unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due, or if any other event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement or other indebtedness or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.","We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including additional tranches of term loans and/or term loan increases, increases to our revolving commitments and/or additional revolving credit facilities as well as off-balance sheet financings, contractual obligations, and general and commercial liabilities. Although the Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Rollover Citrix Notes Indenture, the indenture that will govern the Notes and the documents governing the Series A Preferred Stock contain, or will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such restrictions are, or will be, subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and any additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.

However, the guarantees by the guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other ----- obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Because we have substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We have attempted, and may continue to attempt, to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. As of February 28, 2024, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the March 2024 Transaction and this offering of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately $8,600.1 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate indebtedness, representing approximately 49% of our total debt.

Additionally, under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a change of control may constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings ----- under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend, and, under the terms of the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture, a change of control will require us to make a change of control offer with respect to the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, respectively. The source of funds for any purchase of the Notes, the First Lien Notes or the Second Lien Notes and any repayment of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes, the First Lien Notes or the Second Lien Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes, the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes or events of default and potential breaches of the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that will govern the Notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings, financial condition or the value of the Notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions which would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the Notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the guarantees thereof and any related security could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or any related security and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees left the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. ----- As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the guarantees and any related security would be subordinated to other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee and any related security was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or security interest, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee or security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that indebtedness. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants and related guarantees would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants, guarantees and security interests were in force.

The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the applicable collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the applicable collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as ----- to the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest or “adequate protection” with respect to such difference.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the applicable collateral agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. Furthermore, the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain customary exceptions to perfection actions that would be required to be taken in order to perfect a security interest in certain types of Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional steps to perfect in such property and rights are taken. If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the Notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. The Issuer and the guarantors will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Trustee for the Notes or the applicable collateral agent will monitor, or that we will inform such Trustee for the Notes or applicable collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral securing the Notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral. None of the Trustee for the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or any other applicable collateral agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral securing the Notes or to monitor the perfection of any security interest, or to make any filings to perfect or maintain ----- the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, the security interest of the applicable collateral agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the applicable collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the applicable collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets.

Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the applicable collateral agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is ----- materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect to the Notes offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes.

We compete with various providers of software including portions of VMWare (Broadcom), Microsoft, AWS, F5, Radware, A10 and Cisco, generally, as well as other pure play companies with respect to only certain of the brands in which we operate. We also face competition for certain aspects of our product and service offerings from major systems integrators, and our customers have alternatives to our proprietary software from open source software providers that provide software and intellectual property, typically without charging license fees, or from other competitors offering products through alternative business models, such as SaaS and DaaS. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, product development, sales and marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and longer operating histories than we do. This may allow our present or future competitors to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer; adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies, evolving industry trends or customer requirements; execute more effectively on their marketing and sales strategies and leverage their internal relationships; and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. For example, some of our competitors offer products outside our sector of the software market and routinely bundle these products with their infrastructure software products. Also, some of our competitors are expanding their competitive product offerings and strengthening their market position through increases in capital expenditures for internal research and development. We compete based on our ability to offer to our customers the most current and desired solution and services features. We expect that competition will continue to be intense, and there is a risk that our competitors’ products may be less costly, more heavily discounted or free, provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our solutions. Additionally, there is a risk that our solutions may become outdated or that our market share may erode. Further, the announcement of the release, or the actual release, of new solutions incorporating similar features to our solutions could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future solution and service offerings. Existing or new solutions and services that provide alternatives to our solutions and services could materially impact our ability to compete in these markets. As the markets for our solutions and services, especially those solutions in early stages of development, continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software, cloud, networking, mobile, data sharing and related industries, could enter, or increase their footprint in, the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition will remain a significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins and we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets or against ----- existing and future competitors, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets and as our current competitors seek to increase market share. Further, we may see new and increased competition in different geographic regions. The generally low barriers to entry in certain of our businesses increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors, whether small and medium-sized businesses or larger, more established companies. Smaller companies new to our market may have more flexibility to develop on more agile platforms and have greater ability to adapt their strategies and cost structures, which may give them a competitive advantage with our current or prospective customers. We may also experience increased competition from new types of solutions as the options for DaaS, VDI, security, application delivery, integration, master data management and analytics offerings increase. Further, as our industry evolves and if our company grows, companies with which we have strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas, or our current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures we face. In addition, the industry has been volatile and there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect companies will attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving and volatile industry. For example, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered and more effectively address the needs of prospective customers. Additionally, as IT companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving digital workspace services, networking, integration and data sharing and analysis markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive IT solutions to end users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions that may compete with our DaaS, VDI, security, application delivery, integration, master data management and analytics solutions. These consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources and brand loyalty than we do, and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary solutions and services. The companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling solution and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can. These heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.3.2,"Our Citrix and NetScaler businesses rely, and our other businesses are expected to rely to a greater extent, as our businesses evolve, on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control.","The Citrix and NetScaler businesses rely significantly, and our other businesses are expected to rely to a greater extent, as our businesses evolve, on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our solutions and services. Our distributors generally sell through resellers. Our distributor and reseller base is relatively concentrated. We periodically revise our sales incentive programs for our independent distributors and resellers, and such program revisions may adversely impact our results of operations. Changes to our sales incentive programs can result from a number of factors, including our transition to a subscription-based business model and segmentation of our routes to market to increase efficiency. Our competitors may, in some cases, be effective in providing incentives to current or potential distributors and resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our solutions. The loss of or reduction in sales to our distributors or resellers could materially reduce our revenues. Further, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations. Any significant delays, defaults or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also bear the risk that our channel partners will fail to comply with U.S. or international anti-corruption or anti-competition laws, in which case we might be fined or otherwise penalized as a result of the agency relationship with such partners. Our channel partners may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, and we have implemented partner-specific training programs, but there can be no assurance that such policies will be followed. For instance, in the event that sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing ----- revenue in accordance with our sales programs. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, in significant resources to develop these channel relationships, which could adversely impact our results of operations if such channels do not result in increased revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Because subscription revenue related to our subscription solutions is typically recognized over time, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a deferral of software revenues and a corresponding impact on our maintenance revenues. During our transition to the subscription-based model, our customer billings and cash collections have also been impacted. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. The subscription-based model may also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any one period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further, while many of our subscription-based offerings involve multi-year commitments, ultimately our subscription customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the subscription term, or to renew only for a portion of our solutions or to renew on pricing terms that are less favorable to us. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline, fluctuate, or not improve as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our solutions, their ability to continue their operations and spending levels, the pricing of our solutions and the availability of competing solutions. The amount of our recognized revenue also depends on factors like the average duration of subscriptions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions or demand pricing or other concessions prior to renewal, if our renewal rates fluctuate or decline, or if our customers opt to purchase subscriptions with short-term durations, our total bookings and revenue will fluctuate or decline, and our business and financial results will be negatively affected. In addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business have evolved over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. The transition to a subscription-based business model also means that our historical results, especially those achieved before we began the transition, may be difficult to compare to our future results. If we are unable to continue to navigate our transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. The foregoing risks and circumstances may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The market for solutions that meet our customers’ needs in accessing and organizing their work in a secure way is evolving and dynamic, and we must continue to evolve to address that market. Expansion of our cloud-based solutions has required, and may continue to require, a considerable investment in resources, including technical, financial, legal, sales, information technology and operational systems. While market acceptance of such offerings has been positive, and the majority of our services are now provided through cloud-based subscriptions, ongoing acceptance is affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, security, service availability, reliability, availability of tools to automate cloud migration, scalability, integration with public cloud platforms, customization, availability of qualified third-party service providers to assist customers in transitioning to our cloud-based solutions, performance, pricing, current license terms, support terms, community ----- engagement, customer preference, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding data privacy or data protection, and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations. To address the challenges in transitioning our remaining customers to the cloud, we have invested in innovation and feature development, simplified cloud migration, and performance and reliability, as well as other cloud customer success and sales initiatives. There can be no assurance, however, that these initiatives will result in an increase in the transition of our customers from on-premise to our cloud-based solutions. If we are unable to transition our customers to cloud-based solutions at the pace we expect, we may experience a negative impact on our overall financial performance. Further, our cloud-based solutions provide customers with increased visibility into the level of active use of such solutions by the customers’ employees or other end users. This enhanced visibility may adversely impact renewal rates if enough users in a customer organization do not actively engage with our solutions. While we believe we are well placed to provide cloud-based solutions to all of our customers, the success in transitioning customers to our cloud-based solutions is dependent on our ability to effectively align, prioritize and allocate our engineering and other resources to balance the needs of maintaining our existing products, while also innovating in future products and features, and ensuring security and resiliency.

The demand for our solutions and services depends substantially upon the general demand for businessrelated computer appliances and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels, the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers, and general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates. As we continue to grow our subscription service offerings, we must continue to innovate and develop new solutions and features to meet changing customer needs. If we are not successful in expanding our core technologies into additional applications and products, developing enhancements to existing products and new products in a timely manner, enhancing our service offerings or generating higher average selling prices, our existing and potential customers may not purchase or subscribe to our products and services, our market share, revenues and gross margins may decline, and our business and operating results may suffer. Our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of platforms, standards and technologies, and we are constantly evaluating the feasibility of adding new platforms, standards and technologies. There may be future or existing platforms, standards and technologies that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be architecturally compatible with our software products. In addition, the effort and expense of developing, testing and maintaining software products will increase as more platforms, standards and technologies achieve market acceptance within our target markets, which could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedule. Our ----- failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could lower the demand for any solutions and services and/or make our solutions uncompetitive and obsolete. Global economic forecasts for the IT sector are uncertain and continue to highlight an industry in transition from legacy platforms to mobile, cloud, data analytics and social and AI-based solutions . If our current and prospective customers cut costs, they may significantly reduce their IT expenditures. For example, lower spending by corporate and governmental customers around the world has had a disproportionate impact on IT spending, which has led to a reduction in sales in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Moreover, the purchase of our solutions and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Any of our new product offerings or significant enhancements to current product offerings could cause some customers to delay making new or additional purchases while they fully evaluate any new offerings we might have introduced to the market, which in turn may slow sales and adversely affect operating results for an indeterminate period of time. Also, we may not execute successfully on our product plans because of errors in product planning or timing or acceptance by the marketplace, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors providing those solutions before us, thereby resulting in loss of market share and earnings. We need to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which will require us to devote significant resources. Many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third-party products, which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software. If the market fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we expect, our sales will be adversely affected. Also, even if corporate and governmental spending increases and companies make greater investments in IT and infrastructure software, our revenue may not grow at the same pace.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

In some cases, customers in different markets, such as financial services or government, have specific regulatory or other requirements that we must meet. For example, in order to maintain contracts with the U.S. government, we must comply with specific rules and regulations relating to and that govern such contracts. Government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. If we fail to meet such requirements in the future, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or a reduction of revenue which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Our customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions of our products or not to use our services in the future. As a result, a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods. In addition, all of our legacy maintenance and support agreements are sold on a term basis. In order for us to grow our revenues and increase profitability, it is important that our existing customers renew, upgrade and expand their subscription licenses after the initial terms expire. To this end, we have introduced two new GTM strategies: Universal Licensing, allowing customers to deploy our software both in the cloud or on premise, and Platform Licensing, allowing customers to use all products licensed by a specific business unit. During the fiscal year ending November 30, 2024, we intend to roll out the Platform Licensing model within the TIBCO business unit, and we are actively consolidating the number of SKUs within all business units, which we hope will simplify our sales process and make it easier for customers to deploy our technology. Also, our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including as a result of these changes. Any inability on our part to upsell to and generate ----- revenues from our existing customers or the loss of significant customers or renewals of customers on terms less favorable to us could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our future growth also depends on our ability to attract new customers through business partners and resellers. This will depend, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing effort and the efforts of our business partners and resellers. For our business, the ability to attract new customers can sometimes be difficult as a potential customer may be reluctant or unwilling to change from their existing products as they may have already made substantial personnel and financial investments in their existing products. If our business partners and resellers are unable to attract new customers of our products and maintain and expand those relationships, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

In some cases, these errors are not discovered until after commercial shipments or deployments have been made. Errors in our products or services could delay the development or release of new products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, our products and services use, integrate with and otherwise depend on third-party products, which third-party products could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless. Because our products and services are often used in mission-critical applications, if defects or errors are discovered after commercial release of either new versions or enhancements of our products and platforms: - potential customers may delay purchases; - customers may react negatively, which could reduce future sales; - our reputation in the marketplace may be damaged; - we may have to defend against product liability, warranty or other claims; - we may be required to indemnify our customers, distributors, OEMs or other resellers; - we may incur additional service and warranty costs; and - we may have to divert additional development resources to correct the defects and errors, which may result in the delay of new product releases or upgrades. If any or all of the foregoing occur, we may lose revenues, incur higher operating expenses and lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.3.9,"Certain of our offerings have sales cycles which are long and/or unpredictable, which could cause significant variability and unpredictability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.","Generally, a substantial portion of our large and medium-sized customers implement our solutions on a departmental or enterprise-wide basis. We have a long sales cycle for these departmental or enterprise-wide sales because: - our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large-scale deployment of our solution to potential and existing customers prior to sale; - our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our solutions and services; ----- - our customers are typically large and medium-sized organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure; and - before making a purchase, our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations, and this process can be lengthy. Our long sales cycle for these solutions makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis. In addition, the long sales cycle for these solutions makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our bookings, revenue and/or operating results for any particular period, and large projects with significant IT components may fail to meet our customers’ business requirements or be canceled before delivery, which likewise could adversely affect our revenue and operating results for any particular period. Cloud-based solutions and subscription-based business models are particularly sensitive to these factors, and as a result, we may be increasingly affected by long sales cycles as our business transitions continue. Overall, the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur in the last month, weeks and days of each quarter. In addition, our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and such fluctuations are generally most significant in our fourth fiscal quarter and, as Citrix had a fiscal year end of December 31, for the first month of our first fiscal quarter, which we believe is due to the impact on revenue from the availability (or lack thereof) in our customers’ fiscal year budgets and an increase in expenses resulting from amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans as performance milestones are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower sales in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

For example, past domestic and global economic downturns resulted in reduced demand for information technology, including enterprise software and services. Additionally, current economic and market conditions are uncertain. The direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain and volatile, and could be adversely affected by, among other things: - current uncertainties in the global and domestic economies, including disruption in the banking sector; - global risks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and developments in the Middle East; - the price of oil and its related effects on the economy; - the rate of inflation and whether and how long inflation will continue to run at a rate higher than it historically has; - changes in interest rates; - volatility in the stock markets globally; - political and economic changes and uncertainty in the United States and elsewhere, including in connection with the 2024 election cycle in the United States; - uncertainty or renegotiation of trade agreements between the United States and other countries; - changes in the trading and political relationship between the United States and China; ----- - downturns in the financial industry; - volatility in currency exchange rates; - increasingly divergent laws, regulations and licensing requirements between the UK and the EU, resulting from the UK’s exit from the EU, often referred to as “Brexit”; and - terrorist attacks and other geopolitical factors, including relationships between the United States and each of Russia, North Korea and Iran. These and other factors make it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. We cannot predict the duration of these economic or political conditions and the impact they may have on our customers or business. In response to economic uncertainty, we expect that many governmental organizations that are current or prospective customers for our solutions and services would cutback spending significantly, which would reduce the amount of government spending on IT and demand for our solutions and services from government organizations. Contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult if customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract terms and conditions. These economic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic environment, are beyond our control and could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments, slower adoption of new technologies, increased price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and procure consulting services.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.3.11,"Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services or cyberattacks on our services infrastructure or corporate networks could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.","Use of our products and services may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances our own and our customers’ and other parties’ business, financial and personal data. As we continue to evolve our products and features, we expect to host, transmit or otherwise have access to increasing amounts of potentially sensitive data. Our products and services are deployed across both cloud and on-premise environments and provide different security risks. Unlike cloud, the on-premise environment subjects potentially sensitive data to the maintenance measures of the customer and limits data recovery options. Maintaining the security of our products, computer networks and data storage resources is important and service vulnerabilities could result in loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have in the past, and may in the future, discover vulnerabilities in our products or underlying technology, which could expose our reputation, our operations, our customers and the data held by our customers to risk. Generally, we address theses vulnerabilities through product patches that are promptly applied across our cloud environment. However, patches for on-premise environments are controlled by the customer. Although we encourage prompt application of patches, we cannot ultimately control whether customers apply them. Customer delay in patch application can prolong detected vulnerabilities in our products. For example, in October 2023, we released builds to fix CVE-2023-4966, which affected our NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway on-premises products. If exploited, CVE 2023-4966 can result in unauthorized data disclosure. Although we urged our customers to apply the patch to their impacted products immediately, CVE-20234966 was widely exploited by threat actors in attacks, some of which included unauthorized access to, and exfiltration of, our customers’ data from their environments. Such attacks on our customers’ environments has resulted in litigation and a regulatory inquiry. See “Note 13—Legal Proceedings” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for additional information. In addition, to the extent we are diverting our resources to address and mitigate these vulnerabilities, it may hinder our ability to deliver and support our products and customers in a timely manner. As a more general matter, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, alter, disclose, delete or otherwise compromise our confidential information or that of our employees, partners, customers or their end users, create system disruptions, product or service vulnerabilities or cause shutdowns. These unauthorized parties are becoming increasingly sophisticated, particularly those funded by or acting as formal or informal representatives of, or acting in conjunction with, nation states. Perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy ----- viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that directly or indirectly attack our products, services, infrastructure (including third-party cloud service providers upon which we rely), third-party software and applications that we deploy in our internal network. Because techniques used by these perpetrators to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems change frequently and sometimes are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and through a wide variety of methods, and because the full scope of a cyberattack may not be realized until an investigation has been completed, we may be unable to anticipate the techniques used or to implement adequate preventative or response measures. Such threats may see their frequency increased and effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence. In addition, certain measures that could increase the security of our IT systems take significant time and resources to deploy broadly, and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack. Despite our efforts to build secure services, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises. Like many enterprises, we experience attempted attacks on our network and services, and certain of those attacks have resulted in successful unauthorized access to our networks and services. In 2021, we learned that certain open source libraries included in certain of our products and services, as well as in software and services provided by our vendors and used internally, contained vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would enable a remote attacker to take control of an environment over the internet. There is no guarantee that our preventative and mitigation actions with respect to this vulnerability and others like it will eliminate fully the risk of a malicious compromise of the company or our customers. Any of these events could expose us to substantial litigation expenses and damages; consumer claims; indemnity and other contractual obligations; government fines, penalties and enforcement actions (including investigations, audits or inspections); mitigation expenses; and other liabilities. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the adequacy of our security measures could be harmed, our brand and reputation could be impacted, we could lose potential sales and existing customers, our ability to operate our business could be impaired, and we may incur significant liabilities. Our products operate in conjunction with, and are dependent on, a wide variety of third-party products, components and services. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these products, components or services, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within the Company. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards by or with respect to our third-party vendors or acquisitions could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant disruption to our IT systems, or those of our vendors or acquisitions, or breaches of data security could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. Some of the factors that may lead to a breach or compromise in our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ data, our services, and third party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners holding our data, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet include the following: - third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data or IT systems, or our data or IT systems; - efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated attacks, such as retaliatory cyber-attacks stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks; - third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious; ----- - cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate, or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers; - vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing product and service offerings; - vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our products and services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; - vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies; - attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and - employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems. If any of these factors were to occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These misappropriations, cyberattacks or any other compromises of our security measures (or those of our customers or third parties with which we work) as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, vulnerabilities, theft, malfeasance or otherwise could result in (among other consequences): - loss or destruction of customer, employee, partner and other intellectual property or business or personal data; - disruptions in the operation of our business, such as interruption in the delivery of our cloud and other services; - costs associated with investigating, responding to and remediating the root cause, including additional monitoring of systems for unauthorized activity; - negative publicity and harm to our reputation or brand, which could result in lost trust from our customers, partners and employees and could lead some customers to seek to cancel subscriptions, stop using certain of our products or services, reduce or delay future purchases of our products or services, or use competing products or services; - individual and/or class action lawsuits, due to, among other things, the compromise of sensitive employee or customer information, which could result in financial judgments against us or the payment of settlement amounts and cause us to incur legal fees and costs; - as further detailed below, regulatory enforcement action in the United States at both the federal and state level (such as by the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorneys general) or in other jurisdictions under the growing number of data protection legal regimes, including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) or other similar federal, state or local laws, which could result in significant fines and/or penalties or other sanctions and which would cause us to incur legal fees and costs; - costs associated with responding to those impacted by such issues, such as costs of providing data owners, consumers, regulators or others with notice; legal fees; costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by such customers’ credit card issuers; and costs incurred by credit card issuers associated with the compromise; ----- - disputes with our insurance carriers concerning coverage for the costs associated with responding to, and mitigating an incident; and/or - longer-term remediation and security enhancement expenses. Any of these actions could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, while we maintain multiple layers of oversight over enterprise cybersecurity and data protection risks associated with our products, services, information technology infrastructure and related operations, there is no guarantee that our oversight framework will be successful in providing the necessary governance to prevent or adequately respond to the actions described above.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Additionally, under various privacy laws and other obligations, we may be required to obtain certain consents to process personal data, including through the use of tracking technologies on our website. Our inability or failure to do so could result in adverse consequences, including fines, penalties or litigation. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of personal, financial, government and other information. For example, California enacted the CCPA which, among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides statutory damages or fines on a per violation basis that could be very large in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation. California also enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023, and which modifies the CCPA to impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. Following California, a number of other states have passed, or are currently considering, comprehensive privacy laws. In the absence of a federal comprehensive privacy law preempting such state laws, state-led privacy legislation poses compliance challenges, costs, and operational and legal burdens. Europe, the United Kingdom and many other jurisdictions around the world have passed, are updating or are currently considering legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, data security and the collection and use of personal data (including, without limitation, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, the Australian Privacy Act, the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law) that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. Many of these laws provide for fines based on a percentage of a company’s global annual revenue. While we are actively monitoring privacy and data protection regulatory activity, we take a risk-based approach to prioritizing our data protection compliance efforts. Our compliance efforts with these various laws in our higher risk jurisdictions have already caused us to incur substantial implementation and compliance costs and/or required us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and new obligations may have ----- similar effects in the future. Also, any new law or regulation, or interpretation of existing law or regulation, imposing greater fees or taxes or restrictions on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the internet, could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our solutions and our results of operations. Finally, as a technology vendor, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices. Our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated industries, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand, reputation and business. Additionally, we may have contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of our customer data (including personal data). While we have implemented these contracts and have diligence procedures, policies and programs designed to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, GDPR, UK GDPR and other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and procedures. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy notices, our contractual obligations or other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, individuals or others, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, if our privacy policies, marketing materials or other statements regarding data privacy and security are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misrepresentative of our practices or out of compliance with any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, litigation or other adverse consequences. In addition to government activity and contractual obligations, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third-parties that we have obtained for certain services, such as SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, PCI DSS, IRAP, and FedRAMP Moderate. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated industries, and could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws, as well as cybersecurity requirements and industry standards in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and elsewhere can be uncertain and continue to remain in flux. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data localization and portability requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data, the operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time. It is possible that these laws, obligations and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines and penalties, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available to competent supervisory authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations, including a governmental order requiring that we change our data practices, extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order temporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by non-compliant actors, which in turn could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with these regulations, obligations and standards may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we cease conducting the noncompliant activity. Finally, as a technology vendor, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our sales, business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

For example, events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank during 2023 created temporary uncertainty on their ----- customers’ cash deposits in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits prior to actions taken by governmental entities. In addition, in 2024, Republic First Bank collapsed. We had no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, Signature Bank or Republic First Bank. While we maintain our cash deposits across a variety of highly rated financial institutions, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions will not experience similar liquidity issues or that actions taken by governmental entities to mitigate these risks will be sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits and sources of liquidity. Moreover, a liquidity crisis may also result in additional disruption that is not immediately evident but which results in, for example, negative impact on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us in a timely basis or at all and changes in interest rates and availability of credit that impact the nature and timing of customer projects. As a result, a failure of one or more financial institutions with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We also rely on bandwidth providers, Internet service providers, mobile networks and other third-party IT service providers to operate our business and to deliver our solutions. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our service. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the need to implement costly or time-consuming protocols to comply with applicable regulations (including regulations related to conflict minerals), equipment malfunction, natural disasters and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. We also may experience disruptions or delays to our supply chain or fulfillment and delivery operations from, among other things, the temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer facilities, spikes in demand for manufacturing services, interruptions in product supply or insufficient supply of components, restrictions on export or shipment or disruptions in product fulfillment due to closure or delays of our delivery vendors. If we are unable to procure hardware and hardware components in a timely manner from our existing suppliers or are required to change suppliers, there could be a delay in the supply of our hardware or hardware components and our ability to meet the demands of our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers and delayed revenue recognition, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our cloud-based solutions are primarily operated through third-party cloud service providers, which we do not control and which may be subject to actual or perceived damage, interruption, vulnerabilities and other cyber-related risks, including, but not limited to, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery of services, network outages, disruptions in availability of the internet, unauthorized access or other problems. Customers of our cloud-based solutions need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide them with service level commitments with respect to uptime. Third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and therefore, we are vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party cloud providers’ infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our SLAs and the issuance of credits to our cloud offering customers, which may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our security, or that of any of these third-party cloud providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It is possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a thirdparty cloud provider’s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider. It may also become increasingly ----- difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes more complex and the usage of our software increases. Further, if for any reason our arrangement with one or more of our data centers is terminated, we could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities and support. Our data center facilities providers have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the facilities providers on commercially reasonable terms or if in the future we add additional data center facility providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center facilities. In addition, the failure of our data centers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in the availability of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. As we continue to add data centers and increase capacity in existing and future data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during such processes and procedures, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service, and we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer of data to other facilities. Similarly, some of our solutions’ features run or depend on IT services run by third parties, such as data feeds or public clouds such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, and an extended failure of such services might materially and adversely impact our ability to provide our services to our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.3.15,"Our AI offerings introduce risks, which, if realized, could adversely impact our business.","We use artificial intelligence (“AI”) and analytics in our cloud-based solutions and have announced partnerships on AI-related innovations. For example, we recently announced an eight-year strategic partnership with Microsoft that will support the development of new cloud-based and AI solutions. Our engineering organizations are deploying GitHub Copilot to all their engineers with the goal of increasing developer productivity, and Spotfire, a Cloud Software business unit, recently announced a new Spotfire Copilot extension built on Microsoft Azure OpenAI service. AI technologies are complex, rapidly advancing and present risks spanning, among other factors, development, training, sourcing, usage, IP leakage, investment and compliance. For example, datasets used to develop AI models, content generated by AI systems or application of AI systems may be unexpected, flawed, biased, offensive, harmful or violative of confidentiality agreements or current or future laws and regulations or may raise privacy concerns; and the way in which our offerings incorporate and use AI may be incompatible with our customers’ compliance requirements. Any perceived or actual inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or our partners could impair the acceptance of our AI solutions, give rise to legal liability, harm our brand or reputation and negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, if any of our employees, contractors, vendors or service providers use any third-party AIpowered software in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent disclosure of our confidential information, including inadvertent disclosure of our confidential information into publicly available third-party training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or confidential information, harming our competitive position and business. Our ability to mitigate risks associated with disclosure of our confidential information, including in connection with AI-powered software, will depend on our implementation, maintenance, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate technical and administrative safeguards, policies and procedures governing the use of AI in our business. AI technologies also present unique ethical issues and the regulatory landscape is evolving. For example, in Europe, on March 13, 2024, the European Parliament formally adopted a draft of the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (the “AI Act”) which is currently expected to be enacted in mid-2024, pending formal endorsement by the Council of the European Union and publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The current draft of the AI Act, if enacted, would establish, among other things, a risk-based governance framework for regulating AI systems operating in the European Union. AI-related regulations may develop at different rates and inconsistently across jurisdictions, require us to develop AI-specific governance controls, increase investment costs and cause delays in, or disruption to, our offerings. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data on which our AI solutions rely, we may incur liability through the violation of such regulations, third-party intellectual property, publicity or privacy rights or other rights or contracts to which we are a party. Further, our introduction or ----- enablement of new AI offerings or features may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns or other complications that could adversely affect our return on investment, ability to compete or reputation. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Third parties that we rely on may fail or refuse to perform critical operational tasks adequately, and these and other third parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us, refuse to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation, and harm our business. Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that we rely on to provide services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices without competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy or other business interruption, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.

In an effort to address these challenges, we have reorganized our sales leadership, re-aligned our customer-facing organization, enhanced our focus on indirect channels, and largely transitioned to sales of subscription licenses. We also have taken, and may continue to take, actions intended to re-align channel incentives to focus on landing and growing new business in the commercial segment of our business. These changes are significant and may cause short-term disruption. We may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining sales personnel with the knowledge and skills required to market our products and services effectively as part of our GTM strategy. As a result, there may be periods of time when our sales force is not at its desired headcount, which may result in fewer sales of our products and services. This sales reorganization may not result in the short or long-term benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all. Moreover, these changes, or other similar changes that we may choose to make, may cause disruptions in our business that may negatively impact sales over one or more future quarters. Risks related to these activities include: - challenges in reorganizing sales operations and personnel; - inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified direct quota carrying sales personnel; - reduced productivity among new sales team members or while members of the sales team adjust to their new roles and responsibilities and our new sales priorities; ----- - loss of key employees; - inability to re-engage distributors, resellers and other channel partners due to changing market demands or competitive offerings; - higher sales, marketing and services costs; - lengthening of sales cycles as customers evaluate their cloud strategy and competitive offerings; and - continued difficulties in accurately forecasting bookings and revenue and the estimated mix within subscription of on-premise versus cloud. If the disruptions caused by these operational and organizational changes are greater or longer than anticipated, we are unable to maintain an adequate workforce of direct quota carrying sales personnel or we are unable to achieve the expected benefits of these activities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Indirect sales channel partners are an important aspect of our business, and our primary route to market for the commercial and subscale international segments of our business. Our future growth in revenues and profitability depends in part on our ability to identify, establish, engage and retain successful channel partner relationships, which will take significant time and resources and involve significant risk. We have established, and are in the process of extending, long term partnerships in certain regions with the goal of outsourcing our sales and services organizations in those regions. These partnerships require significant administrative and operational ramp up efforts, as well as investment in training and systems implementation. While we are making every effort to ensure that we are selecting the best suited business partners, we cannot be certain that they will be able to attain the levels of revenue achievement expected by the respective organizations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify suitable indirect sales channel partners. To the extent we do identify such partners, we will need to negotiate the terms of a commercial agreement with them under which the partner would distribute our products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate commerciallyattractive terms with any channel partner, if at all. In addition, all channel partners must be trained to distribute our products. In order to develop our distribution channel, we must develop and improve our processes for channel partner introduction and training. We also cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain successful relationships with any channel partners.

Potential growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully maintain and expand international sales, we may need to establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could adversely affect the results of our international operations. These risks include: - compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, including the requirement to submit additional technical information for product registration in order to sell in certain countries; - variability of foreign economic, political, labor conditions and global policy uncertainty, including relocating operations internationally; ----- - risks associated with doing business with foreign government entities, including complex procurement processes, public sector budgetary cycles and availability, termination rights which exceed those typical in the private sector and being subject to audits as government contractors; - currency exchange rate fluctuations; - changing restrictions imposed by regulatory or contractual requirements or limitations, tariffs, quotas or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws; - regional data privacy, security, secrecy and related laws that apply to the transmission of and protection of our and our customers’ data across international borders; - health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic; - difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; - longer accounts receivable payment cycles; - potentially adverse tax consequences; - difficulties in enforcing and protecting intellectual property rights, including increased difficulty as a foreign entity in those international locations; - providing technical information in order to obtain foreign filing licenses for filing our patent applications in certain countries; - increased risk of non-compliance by foreign employees, partners, distributors, resellers and agents or other intermediaries with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; - burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws; - expansion of cloud-based products and services may increase risk in countries where cloud computing infrastructures are more susceptible to data intrusions or may be controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments; - our software and data of our customers being stored in foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to us being required to disclose or provide access to data or intellectual property to a foreign government pursuant to national security or other laws of such foreign jurisdiction; and - as we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if required, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner. Additionally, an increasing number of jurisdictions are imposing data localization laws, which require personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information, to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. For example, Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. These regulations may deter customers from using cloud-based services such as ours, and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. We do not own or operate servers in Russia. As such, to-date, we have not offered our cloud-based offerings in Russia. ----- We operate an engineering and customer support organization in China. Under the China Cyber Security Law (the “CSL”), network operators are required to provide technical support and assistance to public and state security authorities in national security and criminal investigations. The law does not provide details on the extent of technical support and assistance that may be required. There is the possibility that network operators may be required to disclose or provide access to information or data communicated or transmitted through the network owned, utilized or managed by the network operator to comply with the support and assistance requirement of the CSL. While we do not consider the Company to be a network operator, there is the possibility that China could decide to treat the Company as a network operator, and we would need to comply with this law. We have had and may, from time to time, enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures, OEM or similar business relationships with entities in foreign jurisdictions, including governmental or quasi-governmental entities, pursuant to which we may be required to license or transfer certain of our intellectual property rights to such entities. Such relationships could expose us to increased risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our intellectual property, economic and political risks, and contractual enforcement issues.

The risks we commonly encounter in undertaking, managing and integrating acquisitions are: - an uncertain revenue and earnings stream from the acquired company, which could dilute our earnings; - difficulties and delays integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, solutions and systems of the acquired companies; ----- - costs of integrating acquired companies in international transactions due to, among other things, local laws and regulations; - difficulties operating acquired companies as a stand-alone business, if desired, to further our objectives and strategy; - undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in solutions of the acquired companies; - our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; - challenges and costs associated with implementing adequate and appropriate controls, procedures and policies in the acquired business; - difficulties and costs associated with managing or integrating an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; - potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and development; - entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions and which are highly competitive; - the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; - potential difficulties integrating the acquired solutions and services into our sales channel or challenges selling acquired products; - assuming pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; - being subject to unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company’s practices; - potential difficulties securing financing necessary to consummate substantial acquisitions; - incurring a significant amount of debt to finance an acquisition, which would increase our debt service requirements, expense and leverage; - intellectual property claims or disputes; and - litigation arising from an acquisition. Our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies due to these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate transactions, or successfully operate acquired companies on a stand-alone basis, that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Any future divestitures we make may also involve risks and uncertainties. Any such divestitures could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture. For example, in connection with a divestiture, we may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic ----- relationships, including long-term services arrangements, or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction, which may result in additional expense. Further, if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our operating results and financial conditions could be adversely affected. In addition, we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources. Therefore, we may engage in discussions for, and incur expenses and fees for, acquisitions that do not ultimately occur. This could result in a diversion of our management’s time and increased expenses. Additionally, in order to finance any acquisition, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or a capital contribution, or to use our cash reserves. In that event, we may not be able to raise additional funds or we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us. Use of our cash reserves for acquisitions could limit our financial flexibility in the future. The terms of existing or future loan agreements may place limits on our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions. If we are not able to acquire strategically attractive businesses, products or technologies, we may not be able to remain competitive in our industry or achieve our overall growth plans.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business.,"In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2022, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls relating to accounting and disclosures associated with the Merger, which has not yet been remediated. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In particular, we determined that we should ensure that individuals with appropriate competence and authority evaluate and review the accounting for acquisitions. We believe that the material weakness was isolated to processes surrounding the acquisition accounting for the Merger and we are in the process of remediating the material weakness to ensure it does not recur. For example, we are in the process of adding additional qualified accounting personnel to our reporting team, adding additional controls and increasing the levels of review to ensure that the material weakness does not recur. While we are undertaking efforts to remediate this material weakness, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until our remediation plans have been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. As there were no business combinations or similar transactions affecting the Company during fiscal 2023, management was unable to implement its remediation plans and, thus, unable to test such remediation. Therefore, at this time, we cannot predict the success of our remediation efforts or the outcome of our assessment of such efforts. We also can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, which could materially adversely affect us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. However, we do amortize certain product related technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles and we periodically evaluate them for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value, at the reporting unit level, which for us also represents our operating segment. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets, including estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, estimating the applicable tax rates, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, projecting the future industry trends and market conditions, and making other assumptions. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates ----- we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates, may materially affect our results of operations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, including changes in our reporting structure, could materially affect our determinations of fair value. In addition, due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Also, we may make divestitures of businesses in the future. If we determine that any of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions is impaired or goodwill is impaired, then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a charge to current earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets, or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We depend on the companies with which we have strategic relationships to successfully test our solutions, to incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those solutions. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic relationships or that they will continue in the future. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, such relationships carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic relationship and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development, reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, service mark, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our source code, innovations and other intellectual property, all of which offer only limited protection. The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, tradename, patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights or steal, or misappropriate, copy, disclose or reverse engineer our proprietary information, including certain portions of our solutions or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary source code. We have sought to protect our intellectual property through offensive litigation and may seek other avenues for enforcement or for return on our investment in our patent portfolio, which may be costly and unsuccessful and/or subject us to successful counterclaims or challenges to our intellectual property rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate, and we may choose not to pursue or maintain protection for our intellectual property in the United States or foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our ability to monitor and control theft, misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States as the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary information as do the laws of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property from infringement and our proprietary source code against unauthorized theft, copying, disclosure or use, we could lose market share, including as a result of unauthorized third parties’ development of solutions and technologies similar to or better than ours. The scope of our patent protection may be affected by changes in legal precedent and patent office interpretation of these precedents. Software-based patents are difficult to obtain and enforce in many jurisdictions and there may also be limits on recovery for damages in those jurisdictions. Further, any patents owned by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being ----- currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of protection we seek, if at all; and if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law and the enforceability of licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our solutions under “click-to-accept” license agreements that are not signed by licensees and through electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our solutions. Moreover, with respect to the various confidentiality, license or other agreements we utilize with third parties related to their use of our solutions and technologies, there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements. We may depend on third-party licensors of technology to enforce and protect intellectual property rights that we may license, and such third parties may refuse to enforce and protect such intellectual property rights. Further, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights (such as initiating infringement lawsuit against a third party), the results of such proceedings, regardless of merit, are uncertain and our success cannot be assured. Even if we were to prevail, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

While we seek to protect such proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors, advisors, consultants and other third parties, we cannot guarantee that we have entered or will enter into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information, or that these agreements will not be breached. We may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, now or in the future, were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or other third party, our competitive position could be materially and adversely harmed. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these measures, they may be breached or insufficient, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or insufficiency. We may now or in the future engage in business and technology collaborations with third-party partners that may result in the partner owning, or the parties jointly owning, certain intellectual property, which may be based on or derived from our or the partner’s proprietary information or existing intellectual property. If we do not have adequate rights to use such partner-owned proprietary information or intellectual property, we may be restricted from using it in our process, products or services.

We have been subject to patent infringement claims and may in the future be subject to an increased number of intellectual property claims, including claims alleging the ----- unauthorized use of a third-party’s code in our solutions. We may also be subject to ownership or inventorship disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants, contractors or others who are involved in developing our intellectual property. Although it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property, or be required to pay royalties for access to such intellectual property rights (which may not be commercially reasonable). Other owners may also be able to license such rights to other third parties, including our competitors. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. In addition, our use of open source software components in our products may make us vulnerable to claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property rights, in particular because many of the open source software components we may incorporate with our products may be developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. An increase in intellectual property claims may occur for a variety of reasons, including: - the expansion of our product lines through product development and acquisitions; - the volume of patent infringement litigation commenced by non-practicing entities; - an increase in the number of competitors in our industry segments and the resulting increase in the number of related solutions and services and the overlap in the functionality of those solutions and services; - an increase in the number of our competitors and third parties that use their own intellectual property rights to limit our freedom to operate and exploit our solutions, or to otherwise block us from taking full advantage of our markets; - our reliance on the technology of others and, therefore, the requirement to obtain intellectual property licenses from third parties in order for us to commercialize our solutions or services, which licenses we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain from these third parties on reasonable terms; and - the unauthorized or improperly licensed use of third-party code in our solutions. Further, responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity or merit, could result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays and divert our management’s attention away from running our business. Intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following: - pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods) to the party claiming infringement; - cease selling solutions or services that use the challenged intellectual property; - obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or - redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or not be accomplished. If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted. ----- Our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of our customers for intellectual property infringement claims. Further, particularly because patent applications in the United States and many other countries are not publicly disclosed at the time of filing, applications covering technology used in our software products may have been filed without our knowledge. If we were to discover that our products infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, we would have to obtain licenses from these parties, which could require the payment of royalty or licensing fees, in order to continue offering our products without substantial re-engineering. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, and if we could not obtain such licenses, we might not be able to re-engineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion.

Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Apache License (version 2), “BSDstyle” licenses, “MIT-style” licenses and other open source licenses which permit the user to copy, modify and distribute the software, typically free of charge. Certain open source software is licensed pursuant to license agreements that require a party who distributes the open source software as a component of the party’s software to publicly disclose part or all of the source code to the party’s software. This effectively renders what was previously proprietary software open source software. Even though we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, including ensuring no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, such use could inadvertently occur and it is possible that not all instances of our open source code usage are properly reviewed. Additionally, software purchased through the supply chain may contain open source software of which we are unaware that could present license rights and/or security risk. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use such that we have not triggered any of these conditions, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation or enforcement of many of the terms of these types of licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the distribution of our solutions that contained open source software, and required to comply with the terms of the applicable license, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in an unintended manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to publicly release the source code of our proprietary software, offer our solutions that use the open source software for no cost, make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and/or license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software. Open source software may also present risks of unforeseen or unmanaged security vulnerabilities that could potentially unintentionally be introduced into our solutions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the geographic mix of our revenue, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, our ----- intercompany transfer pricing allocations and other tax liabilities. Any change in the geographical allocation of our business could adversely affect our tax rates to the extent the shift is weighted towards jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Pillar Two of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Global Tax Deal establishes a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% applied to cross-border profits of large multinational corporations. The OEDC expects countries to implement components of Pillar Two starting in 2024, although jurisdictions may establish a safe harbor delaying implementation a number of years. Additionally, there may also be future guidance and interpretation from the IRS, the SEC, the FASB and various other tax jurisdictions that affect our results of operations and financial condition. The tax impact from any of these provisions may have a material effect on our U.S. taxes and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and situations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our income tax returns are routinely subject to audits by tax authorities and those authorities may disagree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine our estimates of uncertain tax positions, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many countries in the EU, and other countries where we do business, are actively considering or have enacted changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, which may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the U.S., may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions.

For example, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would result in lower revenues from our international sales when sales are translated into U.S. dollars, although these decreases may be partially offset by lower operating expenses. Additionally, customers in foreign countries that incur higher costs due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar may elect to delay payments or default on credit extended to them. Any material delay or default in our collection of significant accounts could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Further, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar could require us to offer discounts, reduce pricing or offer other incentives to mitigate any negative effects on demand from such a rise in the U.S. dollar. In the event that the U.S. dollar weakens compared to foreign currencies, we may incur higher operating expenses in those locations and, therefore, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. As our international operations continue to grow, or if large fluctuations in foreign exchange rates continue, our revenue, operating expenses and income may be adversely affected. In order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar, we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as we deem ----- appropriate for a portion of our expenses, which are denominated in the local currency of our foreign subsidiaries. We generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses for those currencies to which we have the greatest exposure. When the dollar is weak, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher, and these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gains realized from our hedging contracts. If the dollar is strong, foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower. These lower expenses will in turn be partially offset by the losses incurred from our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk and there is no guarantee that we will accurately forecast the expenses we are hedging, and our hedging program may not reduce the impact of short-term or long-term volatility in foreign exchange rates. Further, a substantial portion of our overseas assets and liabilities are denominated in local currencies. To protect against fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in currency exchange rates when remeasuring our balance sheet, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to this potential volatility. Our foreign currency forward contracts are intended to reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For example, we do not execute forward contracts in all currencies in which we conduct business. There is no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective. In addition, as a result of entering into these contracts with counterparties who are unrelated to us, the risk of a counterparty default exists in fulfilling the hedge contract.

Significant portions of our computer equipment, intellectual property resources and personnel, including critical resources dedicated to research and development and administrative support functions are presently located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an area of the country that is particularly prone to hurricanes, and at our various locations in California, an area of the country that is particularly prone to earthquakes and wildfires. We also have operations in various domestic and international locations that expose us to additional diverse risks. The occurrence ----- of natural disasters, such as extreme weather, hurricanes, floods or earthquakes; pandemics and global public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; or other unanticipated catastrophes, such as telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, fires or terrorist attacks, at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers and customers do business, could cause interruptions in our operations. For example, hurricanes have passed through southern Florida causing extensive damage to the region. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. In addition, even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other casualty events could have a significant impact on our partners’, suppliers’ and customers’ businesses, which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, or our partners’, suppliers’ or customers’ businesses, due to natural disasters, pandemics or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Additionally, a substantial portion of our product orders are usually received in the last month of each fiscal quarter, with a concentration of such orders in the final two weeks of the quarter. We typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order and may have orders that have not shipped at the end of any given quarter.

The combination has created a portfolio of companies under the management of Cloud Software, collectively one of the world’s leading software providers capable of providing comprehensive, secure and optimized infrastructure for enterprise application and data management. Our mission is to create long-term financial value by building a diversified software company that develops, sells and supports mission-critical products that serve the largest enterprises globally. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Krause, our strategy is to focus on high-quality, sustainable ARR while driving industry leading EBITDA. We achieve those results by: - maintaining a rigorous and disciplined approach to investment; - critical examination of our products to determine core value propositions; - investment to deliver highly innovative and competitive solutions to our customers; - a focus on renewals and expansion within our existing customer base; - divestiture of assets that are not conducive to long-term favorable results in our model; and - highly efficient and scalable corporate functions that support our businesses. We build or buy technology to enhance our businesses’ core products. We anticipate acquiring additional businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to customers and are good fits to operate within our model. The Company goes to market under seven portfolio Company brands: Citrix, NetScaler (as a brand of Citrix), TIBCO, ibi (as a brand of TIBCO), ShareFile, NetScaler eCommerce, Spotfire, Jaspersoft, and XenServer. We have coalesced our strategy around these brands to: - allow focus by those brands on core value propositions with increased innovation investment; - create significant cost savings and long-term operating efficiencies; - drive accountability in each business; and - leverage increased cash flow to allow debt repayment and future acquisitions. Collectively, Citrix, NetScaler and TIBCO represent about 87% of Cloud Software’s ARR for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

According to IDC, Citrix is a leader in the Virtual Client Computing (“VCC”) market. Citrix customers include some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world ----- and span major industry verticals, including healthcare, financial services, technology, manufacturing, consumer and government agencies. Citrix has long-standing relationships with its customers with an average 10 years of tenure. Citrix supports today’s remote and hybrid work environment with a broad range of features and functionalities that tie together the myriad of applications that reside within enterprises. Citrix provides secure access to employees, helps minimize distractions and improve focus, enabling them to do their best work, elevating employee productivity and employee engagement, and improving an enterprise’s security profile. Further, Citrix delivers a unified and secure offering with single sign-on access to all the applications and content employees use in one unified platform. For administrators, Citrix enables proactive management of security threats in complex, distributed, hybrid, multi-cloud and multi-device environments, and it empowers administrators to deliver applications to end users more securely than operating them natively. Citrix, through its brand NetScaler, has a long history as the application delivery controller of choice for Fortune 500 companies who rely on it for both employee-facing and customer-facing applications. Today, NetScaler is a line of networking technology, which includes application delivery, applications insights, and application security - to help enterprises efficiently consolidate their application delivery and security infrastructure. In March 2024, Citrix announced a new platform licensing program and evolved its universal subscription licensing. The new licensing programs bring the suite of Citrix capabilities, including VDI, DaaS, ADC, Zero Trust, Observability and others, together in a single license. For customers, these changes: - consolidate and optimize costs; - protect business-critical applications and data; - reduce operational complexity; and - improve user experience. Effectively, the unified licensing model gives customers entitlements to all capabilities, delivering greater value. For Citrix, the new licensing programs simplify our sale process by consolidating the suite of capabilities into a single license, and our back-end operations by reducing the number of SKUs we manage. Citrix goes to market directly and through partners, depending on customer ARR. Our largest customers have assigned account executives and often receive support from large systems integrators partnered with Citrix. Customers below a certain ARR level are serviced by resellers and distributors.  Sales to all customer tiers are outsourced to partners in the three following regions: Latin America (excluding Brazil), ASEAN and emerging markets (Middle East and Africa). Meaningful Citrix competitors include certain offerings from VMWare’s EUC division recently acquired by KKR, Microsoft, AWS, F5, Radware, A10 and Cisco. _Technology Relationships_ Citrix’s most important technology relationship is with Microsoft, a relationship that has for over 30 years spanned product development, GTM initiatives and channel partner development. This has provided mutual customers secure, high-performance delivery of applications, desktops and data to their employees. In April 2024, Citrix and Microsoft extended its strategic partnership for an additional eight years. The renewed strategic partnership includes a focus on the development of new cloud and AI solutions with an integrated Citrix / Microsoft product roadmap, allowing Citrix the opportunity to enhance the value of Citrix software as well as contribute to Microsoft AVD. Specifically, Citrix will be the preferred Microsoft Global Azure Partner solution for Enterprise Desktop-as-a-Service when collaborating with joint Azure customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, product enhancements, and new product developments are all essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and similar rights in other countries, as well as on contractual measures. In order to limit access to and disclosure and use of confidential information and proprietary technology, our portfolio of brands enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors; into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties; and into confidentiality and/or license agreements with distributors and customers. In addition to these contractual measures, the Company also relies on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect the brand and other intellectual property. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and while steps are taken to protect and preserve trade secrets, including maintaining security of on-site premises and physical and electronic security of information technology systems, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. The Company has a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of its products, services, and technologies where appropriate. As of May 1, 2024, the Company owns approximately 2,500 U.S. granted patents and 250 U.S. pending patent applications.

Certain Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.” As of and for the twelve months ended February 28, 2024, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries generated approximately 42.5% of our consolidated revenues, held approximately 5.7% of our consolidated assets and had no debt for borrowed money outstanding, in each case after intercompany eliminations. Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the ----- Guarantor, to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture; (2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; (4) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the First Lien Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor as a result of its Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release); (5) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (6) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and (7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any First Lien Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any First Lien Shared Collateral in any insolvency and solvency proceeding of the Company (including any adequate protection payments) or any Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such First Lien Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or distribution in respect thereof in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or any payment received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such payment, proceeds, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any ----- sale, collection or other liquidation of any First Lien Shared Collateral and all such payments, distributions, and proceeds of any such payment or distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied: (i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) and each Authorized Representative (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any applicable First Lien Document; (ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of the First Lien Obligations of each Series secured by a valid and perfected Lien on such First Lien Shared Collateral on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that, following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to any Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, in the event that the value of the First Lien Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and (iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any First Lien Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening _Creditor”), the value of any First Lien Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be_ deducted on a ratable basis solely from the First Lien Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a mortgage that applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy ----- Code or any other provision of any bankruptcy law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any First Lien Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such First Lien Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such First Lien Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such First Lien Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any First Lien Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such First Lien Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such First Lien Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided, that any proceeds of any First Lien Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above, subject to the Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties on the same rights and priorities as set forth herein. _Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_ The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to a case or proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law, each Authorized Representative (other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the First Lien Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP _Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes First Lien Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling_ Collateral Agent (in the case of any Collateral Agent other than the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such First Lien Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such First Lien Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such First Lien Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such First Lien Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral (in each case, except to the extent a Lien on additional collateral is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive a Lien on such additional collateral), with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each ----- case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not First Lien Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute First Lien Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not (other than as a provider of DIP Financing) object to or oppose (or support any other Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.6,Security for the Notes,21.6.9,Sufficiency of Collateral,"The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first-priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.6,Security for the Notes,21.6.10,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,"The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by any applicable bankruptcy law in the event that any bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon ----- or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase ----- Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.10,Selection and Notice,21.10.1,,"If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Trustee will select by lot or on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.11,Change of Control,21.11.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the First Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. In addition, the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture would require us to make a change of control offer with respect to the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, respectively. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the ----- Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released during the Suspension Period. All such further obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken or the continuance of any circumstances resulting from actions taken or the performance of obligations under agreements entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period (other than agreements to take actions after the Reversion Date that would not be permitted outside of the Suspension Period entered into in contemplation of the Reversion Date). On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

(10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture ----- shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Ratio Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as determined by the Company in good faith and without giving effect to any “pricing flex” term that may be included in any committed financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant or any other covenant to the contrary, (i) if (x) any restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower component”) ----- and (y) the grower component of the applicable restriction, basket, threshold or permission exceeds the applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall be deemed to increase to the highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component and (ii) in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, shall in each case be deemed to be a permitted Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for any period. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions in amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent Entity, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $1,390.0 million and 45.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The First Lien Credit Agreement, the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements conflict with the provisions of the Indenture with respect to the application of proceeds of Asset Dispositions, the Company shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”); ----- and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $1,235.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding; (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”); (6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of $1,235.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such judgment) other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”); (7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other than (1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture or (3) in connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a bankruptcy are less than the greater of $465.0 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such bankruptcy);

or (9) the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents). However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Company ----- does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; _provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to_ Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. ----- If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ----- (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,Depository Procedures,239.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and ----- settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes or the IAI Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes or the IAI Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture that will govern the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuer and the applicable Trustee will treat the persons in whose names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. ----- DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to or from DTC, as applicable. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default (as defined in the “Description of Notes”) under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such additional amounts does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that such additional amounts will have to be paid, in the aggregate, is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that these contingencies are, in the aggregate, remote or incidental is binding on a beneficial owner, unless such beneficial owner explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, then the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a beneficial owner subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the Notes at a rate in excess of yield on the Notes in the absence of these contingencies based upon a “comparable yield”. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Holders of Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,108,CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,108.2,U.S. Holders,108.2.1,,"The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations if you are a U.S. Holder. For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or ----- - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in place under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust. _Stated Interest_ Stated interest on a Note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _Original Issue Discount_ It is expected that the Notes will be issued to investors in this offering for a price equal to the stated principal amount set forth on the cover page of this document. If, contrary to current expectations, the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily-defined de minimis threshold (generally, 1/4 of 1% of the principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID for United States federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID on a Note generally is equal to the excess of the Note’s stated principal amount over its issue price. If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder of a Note (i) generally will be required to include the OID on a Note in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as such OID accrues, on a constant yield basis over the term of the Note, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such OID and regardless of its regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, but (ii) generally will not be required to recognize any additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on the Note that is attributable to previously accrued OID that has been included in such U.S. Holder’s income. The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds such Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the note’s yield to maturity (adjusted for the length of the period) less (b) the stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note as of the beginning of any accrual period will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_ Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Note, less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as described above under “—Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such holder, increased by any OID included in income by such U.S. Holder with respect to such Note. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. _Medicare Tax_ A 3.8% tax is imposed on certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts on the lesser of (1) the U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income” in the case of a trust or estate) for ----- the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). A U.S. Holder’s net investment income will generally include its interest income (including any OID) and its net gains from the disposition of Notes, unless such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). If you are a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to a U.S. Holder’s income and gains in respect of your investment in the Notes. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ In general, applicable payors must report certain information to the IRS with respect to payments of stated interest, accruals of OID, and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including upon a retirement or redemption) of a Note, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) may be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder will generally be allowed as a credit against that U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

For purposes of this summary, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - a nonresident alien individual; - a foreign corporation; or - a foreign estate or trust. The following discussion assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by a non-U.S. Holder in respect of the Notes at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. NonU.S. Holders with any item of income, gain, deduction or loss in respect of the Notes that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax and branch profits tax consequences of investing in the Notes. _Payment of Interest_ Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest (including any OID) paid on a Note by us or any paying agent to a non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax and withholding, provided that: - the non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or constructively; and - either (a) the non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address on a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8 delivered to the applicable withholding agent, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is ----- not a U.S. person as defined under the Code, or (b) the non-U.S. Holder holds its Notes through certain intermediaries and satisfies the certification requirements under applicable Treasury regulations. If a non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (including any OID) made to such non-U.S. Holder on the Notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless it provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8 (or suitable substitute form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable tax treaty. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_ Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest (including any OID) on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payment of Interest”), unless the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition of a Note and certain other requirements are met, in which case such nonU.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable tax treaty rate applies) on any such non-U.S. Holder’s net U.S.-source gain. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ The amount of interest (including OID) paid to a non-U.S. Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-U.S. Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may make this information available to other parties under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty which may include the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder is resident. Provided that a non-U.S. Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on a Note. Certain rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note are generally as follows: - if the proceeds are paid to or through the U.S. office of a broker, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W8) or otherwise establishes an exemption; - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or that has certain specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) unless the non U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on a properly executed and applicable IRS Form W-8) or otherwise establishes an exemption; and - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and does not have certain specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. Holder will generally be allowed as a credit against the non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and the applicable foreign country, or future Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Proposed Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 eliminate potential FATCA withholding on the gross proceeds of a disposition of a Note. The proposed Treasury regulations provide that taxpayers may rely upon such proposal until final Treasury regulations are issued.

Each Plan should also consider the fact that none of Issuer, the initial purchasers, any Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide any investment advice, including in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338
1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” (including “plan assets” that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as IRAs or an entity deemed to hold the assets of such plans) with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of ----- any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, an initial purchaser or a Guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction in violation of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1 respecting specified transactions involving employee benefit plans and broker-dealers, reporting dealers and banks, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 9560 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by inhouse asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied with respect to transactions involving the Notes. Some Plans, including governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. We make no representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for Plans in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular Plan. Neither this discussion nor anything in this offering circular is or is intended to be investment advice directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or at such purchasers generally. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The purchase agreement also provides that, if an ----- initial purchaser defaults with respect to its obligations to purchase the Notes, the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting initial purchasers with respect to the Notes may be increased or, in some cases, the offering with respect to the Notes may be terminated. We have agreed that, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering circular, we will not, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or the Guarantors or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its debt securities (“LockUp Securities”): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (v) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Lock-Up Securities or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the representative. The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the relevant offering price on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. In addition, one or more of the initial purchasers may not be U.S.-registered broker-dealers. All sales of the Notes in the United States will be made by or through U.S.-registered broker-dealers, which may include such affiliates of one or more of the initial purchasers. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date of the offering, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells Notes in reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about       , 2024, which will be the          business day following the date of this offering circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+ , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering), may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A, or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Issuer and the guarantors party thereto have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments which they may be required to make in that respect. The Notes constitute a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Certain initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending ----- on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. - Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions, and in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in investment banking or other transactions of a financial nature with Cloud Software and its affiliates, including the provision of certain advisory services and the making of loans to Cloud Software and its affiliates, for which they have received or may receive customary compensation. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates act as joint lead arrangers, joint bookrunners and/or lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and receive customary fees for performing those services. In particular, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates act as agents and/or lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, as a result, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and/or customary compensation for acting in such capacities. See “Use of Proceeds” for more information. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may be now or in the future be party to certain of our hedging arrangements. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

1182_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.4,Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements,103.4.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. ----- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit. _Deloitte & Touche LLP_ March 8, 2024 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Key sources of revenue include: - Subscription revenue: consists of sale of software, rights to unspecified future products and maintenance, and includes revenue from (i) term-based licenses and related support for a variety of on-premise offerings and (ii) hosted software as a service (“SaaS”) licenses. Subscription offerings deliver the products, updates, and upgrades through the term of the agreement for a single fee and are available through on-premise or cloud deployment models. - Product and license revenue: includes software products sold as perpetual and term-based licenses, with optional maintenance, and to a lesser extent, the sale of hardware products. Licenses are usually sold through product license agreements in case of smaller deployments and enterprise agreements for larger scale deployment with multiple products. License agreements typically include maintenance, which is charged in addition to the license fee. Subscription revenue and product and license revenue are presented together as software revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. - Maintenance revenue: consists of fees for providing software updates on a when-and-if available basis and technical support for software products. Maintenance contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support and include online access to technical content, as well as online and telephone access to technical support personnel, and are usually priced as a percentage of the net on-premise license fees. - Professional services revenue: consists primarily of revenue received for assisting with the implementation of software, on-site support, training, and other consulting services to deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade, and secure our customer’s investments in their applications and infrastructure technologies. Many customers who license our software also enter into separate professional services arrangements with us. Maintenance revenue and professional services revenue are presented together as services and maintenance revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, price concessions, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, we include an estimate of the amount we expect to receive for the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, when the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts _with Customers, we determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following_ steps: - Identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, and the payment terms for the products or services can be identified.

Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives, Accounting Standard Codification ASC 420, “Exit or _Disposal Cost Obligations” (ASC 420) liabilities, and accrued rent. Our lease terms that are used in determining our_ operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease component.

See Note 16 for more information regarding our leases. We review leases for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. Refer to Note 16 for more details. We also sublease certain office space to third-parties.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” and perform an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. For the purposes of testing for impairment, we have determined that we have five reporting units. To assess if goodwill is impaired, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, we consider it more-likelythan-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. This includes comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and, in a second step, the measuring of such impairment. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value. The estimate of the fair value, based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, is subjective and requires judgment, including management assumptions about expected future revenue and earnings forecasts and discount rates, changes in the overall economy and other factors. We perform our annual impairment test at September 30 of each fiscal year. To date, no impairment has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Historically, we assessed the recoverability of our goodwill as of the last day of our fourth quarter.

Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, which includes amortizable intangible and tangible assets, in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. We evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the net asset group exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use of the asset group, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure fair value and to determine the impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets to assess whether a revision to the remaining periods of amortization is required. No long-lived assets impairment losses were incurred in the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. None of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions executed through the acquisition of an entity’s stock is deductible for income tax purposes. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date, estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the preliminary purchase price allocation period, we record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed in operating results in the period in which the adjustments were determined. The total purchase price allocated to the tangible assets acquired is assigned based on the fair values (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy) as of the acquisition date. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired is determined on an income approach, using either the profit allocation method, the relief-from-royalty method, or the multi-period excess earnings method. Under the profit allocation method, we estimate the value of an asset by capitalizing the profit saved due to our owning the asset, rather than paying a royalty for its use. Under the relief-from-royalty method, we estimate the value of an asset by capitalizing the royalties saved because the company owns the asset. We generally use the profit allocation method or the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired trade names and developed technology intangible assets. Under the multi-period excess earnings method, we estimate the value of an asset based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining economic life.

We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current tax exposures, if any, under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, whether or not under audit, including contemplated resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. If the first step is met, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be sustained upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, or refinement of estimates due to new information. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which such determination is made. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If there is a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted.

This standard is effective for non-public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim reporting periods therein.

If the employee is, and has been, continuously employed by the Company through the date of consummation of an approved sale, any incentive service awards which were unvested incentive service awards immediately prior to such approved sale are deemed vested units. Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the incentive service units during the years ended November 30, 2023 and 2022 was $10.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested incentive service stock option awards is $32.9 million as of November 30, 2023 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. Stock option incentive performance awards vest in tranches of 50% upon consummation of a change in control or IPO if the total equity return multiple is equal or greater than 2.0x and the remaining 50% upon a 2.5x attained multiple and if the employee has been employed continuously at the consummation of such an event. All incentive performance awards that are not vested as of the consummation of an approved sale shall terminate and be of no value as of the consummation of such approved sale. Since a liquidity event is a contingent event and not considered probable until the event occurs, no compensation expense for the incentive performance units was recognized for the year ended November 30, 2023. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive performance stock option awards is $45.4 million as of November 30, 2023. These stock option incentive awards are primarily equity-classified awards as there is no requirement for cash settlement and they are only settled in shares that require a hold period of at least six months passing the risk of ownership to the option holder. The value of these equity classified stock option incentive awards is determinable as of the grant date. There is a portion of stock option incentive service units that are liability-classified given they contain an unrestricted put option at the option holder’s discretion at specified periods after the anniversary of the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option incentive awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model, whereby the allocable equity value of the Company is divided by the fully diluted shares to calculate the fair value of the underlying common stock. The stock volatility for each grant is estimated from the historical daily price changes of comparable companies. The expected term of options granted is derived from the weighted average of estimated time to fully vesting of the incentive performance stock awards through a vesting event and the contractual life of the award, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods aligns with the expected life of the option is based on the Daily U.S. Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so. The grant date fair value of performance and service-based stock option incentive awards granted in 2023 and 2022 was calculated using the following assumptions:",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The amount of cash award to be paid is equal to the target incentive multiplied by the difference between the defined equity return multiple and 1. As the multiple is tied to an equity valuation, any compensation charge associated with these awards is considered stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”. As a result of the Merger, we recognized an expense of $76.4 million and paid out a portion of the amount during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022.No liability remains outstanding as of November 30, 2023 with respect to the Plan.

Standard payment terms vary, including based on the country in which the contract is executed, but are generally between 30 and 60 days. Payment terms provide customers with a simplified purchasing experience aligned with the industry and are not intended to secure financing for either party. We assess collectability at the onset of the arrangement, primarily based on the customer’s creditworthiness and collection history. We do not offer right of return or retrospective price protection to any of our customers. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract. Our contracts do not contain warranties that give rise to separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each distinct product or service in the contract.The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis for those performance obligations with stable observable prices and the residual method is applied for any performance obligation with highly variable pricing. We apply judgment to determine whether promised products or services are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised products or services are combined with other products or services and accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue is then recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on our evaluation of when the customer obtained control of the promised products or services. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue recorded in a given period. In addition, we have developed assumptions that required judgment to determine the SSP for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We determine the SSP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographies, market conditions, product life cycles, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, purchase volumes and pricing practices. We review the SSP for each of our performance obligations on a periodic basis and update it, when appropriate, to ensure that the practices employed reflect our recent pricing experience and maximize the use of observable data. When a contract includes an option for a customer to purchase additional products or services at a stated price, we evaluate whether the option provides a material right and if so, allocate a portion of the transaction price to such right based on SSP. Subscription revenue related to on-premise term license agreements includes software licenses, rights to unspecified future products and maintenance. Subscription revenue relating to the software license performance obligation is recognized upfront when we transfer control of the license to the customer while the revenue relating to the maintenance and related rights to unspecified future products, is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. The control of the software license is considered to be transferred upon delivery to the customer or the subscription start date, whichever is later. Subscription revenue for SaaS offerings is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Invoices are generally issued when products are made available to a customer for new transactions and in advance of the subscription period for renewals. Billing terms are generally annual with standard payment terms. License revenue is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Provided all other revenue criteria are met, the upfront, minimum, non-refundable license fees from original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers are recognized upon delivery, and on-going royalty fees are recognized based on OEM units shipped. Revenue on shipments to resellers is recognized when all revenue criteria are met and is recorded net of any consideration payable to the resellers. Invoices are generally issued when products are made available to the customer and follow standard payment terms. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Invoices are issued annually in advance. Payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Professional services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for assisting with the implementation of software, on-site support, training, and other consulting services. Many customers who license the software also enter into separate professional services arrangements with us. Judgment is involved in determining whether the separate consulting agreements need to be considered together with software products to be combined and accounted for as a single contract. If contracts are determined to be economically linked, the total transaction price across the contracts are allocated across the various performance obligations. Substantially all of the professional services ----- arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and, accordingly, are recognized as the services are performed. Contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees are recognized on a proportional performance model based on actual services performed. If there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for professional services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. Work performed and expenses incurred in advance of invoicing are recorded as unbilled receivables. These amounts are billed subsequent to when the work was performed. Training revenue is recognized as training services are delivered. Payments received in advance of consulting or training services performed are deferred and recognized when the related services are performed. We have included the appropriate disclosures by applying the following practical expedients in the application of ASC 606: - We exclude from revenue the taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected from customers; - If at contract inception we expect that the period between performance and customer payment will be one year or less, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component; and - We expense contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing such costs would have been amortized in one year or less. strategic business planning process and allow for operational expediency. The Company believes this change does not represent a material change to a method of applying an accounting principle. This voluntary change in accounting principle, applied prospectively, is preferable as it aligns the annual goodwill impairment test date more closely with our internal budgeting process and did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment of our goodwill. Trademarks 4-10 years The Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). This requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value. The Company estimated, using Level 3 inputs, the fair value of fixed assets using a combination of the cost approach and the market approach. Specific to intangible assets, trade names and developed technology were valued using the relief from royalty method, a variation of the income approach, and customer relationships and maintenance agreements were valued based on the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The Company has recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the purchase date (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy).

The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets described above were as follows (in thousands, except amortization period): significant to operations are the Euro, British pound, and Indian rupee. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are initially reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently recognized in income. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in Other expense, net. The total cumulative unrealized gain on cash flow derivative instruments was $4.4 million as of November 30, 2023. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow derivatives are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gain as of November 30, 2023 is expected to be recognized in income over the next 12 months at the same time the hedged items are recognized in income. We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage currency exposure related to net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and these forward contracts are generally settled within 90 days from trade dates. Our forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For those contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized currently in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on our debt. We may choose whether or not to designate these contracts as hedges. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was derived from discounted cash flow analysis based on terms of the contract and the forward interest rate curves adjusted for our credit risk. The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our interest rate swap agreements.

With the exception of three cases (Birnie, McCauley, and _Werner), each of the Comcast Data Breach Actions erroneously alleges that Citrix had possession of the Comcast_ customer data at the time of the breach. The plaintiffs in Hammond and Carey voluntarily dismissed Citrix on February 14 and March 1, respectively, leaving fifteen Comcast Data Breach Actions pending against Citrix as of March 4, 2024. On January 4, 2024, a plaintiff in one of several cases against Comcast only (i.e., where Citrix is not named a co-defendant) concerning the Comcast data breach pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, filed a Motion to Consolidate and Transfer (“MDL Motion”) with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, seeking to transfer and consolidate all Comcast Data Breach Actions to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for all pretrial proceedings. Briefing on the MDL Motion is complete and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) has set a hearing on the motion for March 28, 2024. A decision from the JPML is anticipated in March or April 2024. Other than one judge in the Southern District of Florida, judges have granted the parties’ requests to delay filing responsive pleadings in the cases until after the JPML decides on the MDL Motion. Accordingly, Citrix was required to file a response to the complaint in Brown on February 26, 2024, and did so in the form of a motion to dismiss. There are five additional Comcast Data Breach Actions pending before the same judge, with at four of those actions currently requiring that a responsive pleading be filed by Citrix prior to the JPML hearing on March 28, 2024. Two additional putative class action lawsuits filed against Citrix in January 2024 (Dailey v. Citrix Systems. _Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case No. 0:24-cv-60038-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Daily”) and Newell v. Citrix Systems, Inc., Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and LoanCare, LLC, Case 0:24-cv-60048-XXXX (S.D. Florida) (“Newell”)_ erroneously alleged that CVE-2023-4966 had a role in a data breach experienced by LoanCare. Following a clear communication from LoanCare to the plaintiffs that Citrix products had no role in the data breach, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed both the Newell and Dailey case without prejudice on January 30, 2024. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in all of the CVE-2023-4966 Class Actions; however, the Company is unable to currently determine the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential exposure or loss, if any. On December 27, 2023, we acquired all outstanding shares of capital stock of Vast Limits GmbH, a company that provides user experience monitoring and endpoint security analytics products.

As of November 30, 2023, and 2022, we had $21.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of deferred tax liability, and a corresponding provision for U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon. The following table summarizes our effective tax rate for fiscal years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021: Effective tax rate ............................................................ 24% 32% 60% The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 24% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 and 32% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate when comparing the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets related to Section 163(j) interest expense limitation. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and 60% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of the prior year integration and the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 release of the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets related to the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation and foreign tax credits as a result of the significant deferred tax liabilities acquired through the merger with Citrix.

At November 30, 2023, $198.0 million included in the balance for tax positions would affect the annual effective tax rate if realized. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax expense. As of November 30, 2023, the Company accrued $25.3 million for the payment of interest. The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income taxes in the United States, as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Specifically, Citrix is currently under review by the United States Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2017 through 2018. With few exceptions, the Company is generally not subject to examination for state and local income tax, or in non-U.S. jurisdictions by tax authorities for years prior to 2018. The statute of limitations for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 remains open for material foreign tax jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty of tax audit outcomes and the timing of tax audit settlements, we are unable to estimate the changes to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

As of November 30, 2023, the Company determined a $509.1 million valuation allowance was necessary, which primarily relates to deferred tax assets for capital loss carryforwards, Section 163j interest limitation carryforwards, tax credits, and net operating losses. As of November 30, 2023, our capital loss carryforward before valuation allowance for income tax purposes was $288.7 million. The capital losses will begin to expire in fiscal year 2028 if not utilized. Our Section 163j interest limitation carryforward before valuation allowance for income tax purposes was $308.2 million and it can be carried forward indefinitely. We provided a valuation allowance of approximately $335.5 million for deferred tax assets related to capital losses and Section 163j carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. As of November 30, 2023, our federal, state, and foreign net operating losses carryforwards before valuation allowance for income tax purposes were approximately $41.2 million. The utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards are limited in any one year pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and may begin to expire in 2025. As a result, we provided a valuation allowance of $17.8 million for deferred tax assets related to domestic and $2.0 million of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized. As of November 30, 2023, the Company held $314.7 million of federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards in the United States, a portion of which may begin to expire in 2027. Subsequently, we provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized related to federal and California research and development tax credits of $1.7 million and $143.6 million, respectively. The changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for the year ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, are as follows (in thousands): ----- Beginning balance ............................................................................... $ 429,048 $ 127,086 Adjustments to prior year valuation ............................................... 32,311 13,379 Current year increase ..................................................................... 59,764 364,171 Current year decrease ....................................................................

In connection with the Merger, total consideration was $15,389.1 million, of which $124.8 million consisted of non-cash consideration in the form of rollover equity of Elliott management and $113.0 million consisted of an assumed liability for the portion of the replacement equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition that were associated with services rendered through the date of the acquisition (“Merger Consideration”). The Merger was funded through a combination of cash, rollover equity, contributions by Holdco, and debt financing. The results of Citrix’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the close of the Merger on September 30, 2022.

Other equity awards that were unvested were automatically canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive an aggregate amount in cash (referred to as a converted cash award) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such Citrix stock option, by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Citrix common stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Citrix stock option immediately prior to the effective time. The converted cash awards were subject to generally the same terms as the corresponding, canceled equity award, including vesting conditions.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including foreign currency contracts. We execute foreign currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements primarily in the retail market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large multi-national and regional banks. The valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended November 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. As of November 30, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted only of cash held in our bank accounts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We review our impairment of long-lived assets, including ROU assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value of the ROU assets is determined by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. We re-evaluated our real estate needs, resulting in a reduction of owned space and leased space, and the impairment of the associated ROU assets and property and equipment. Due to the actions taken, we tested the operating lease ROU assets and certain property and equipment for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. Based on the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups were below the carrying values, indicating impairment. We then determined the fair value of the asset groups by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. For the year ended November 30, 2023, we recognized $29.3 million which primarily consisted of depreciation expense for property and equipment and ROU lease impairment charges which were recorded as Restructuring charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

On January 7, 2024, a plaintiff’s counsel, who originally filed a complaint on December 19, 2023, in the Southern District of Florida against Citrix and Comcast, amended the complaint to name a new plaintiff as the class representative for the putative class action, substituted Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“FHCC”) in place of Comcast as a defendant, and revised the complaint to allege claims arising from a customer data breach announced by FHCC on December 28, 2023, on the basis that FHCC stated on its website that the actors who exfiltrated the FHCC customer data “exploited a vulnerability in a software called Citrix”. The amended complaint was captioned in Paves v. Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Paves”) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Case No. 0:23-cv-62375 (S.D. Florida). Citrix entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff in the Paves case, resulting in Citrix being dismissed with prejudice from Paves on February 6, 2024. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

The $75.0 million related party note to Finco was repaid in full in December 2021, as the proposed acquisition was not consummated. Finco was dissolved on September 21, 2022.

(“Citrix”)","Effective September 30, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), VEP and Elliott, completed their acquisition of Citrix and combined it with Cloud Software Group (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, total consideration was $15,389.1 million, of which $124.8 million consisted of non-cash consideration in the form of rollover equity of Elliott and $113.0 million consisted of an assumed liability for the portion of the replacement equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition that were associated with services rendered through the date of the acquisition (“Merger Consideration”). The Merger was funded through a combination of cash, rollover equity, contributions by Holdco, and debt financing. The results of Citrix’s operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the close of the Merger on September 30, 2022. The Company incurred $50.6 million in transaction costs, which were included in operating expenses for fiscal year 2022. For a description of Citrix’s business, see Note 1 - “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” above. The following is a summary of the purchase price consideration (in thousands): Base purchase price .......................................................................................................... $ 11,836,760 Non-cash consideration of rollover equity ....................................................................... 124,800 Closing indebtedness ........................................................................................................ 3,259,870 Consideration to settle stock-based compensation [(1)] ....................................................... 167,653 Total purchase price consideration ................................................................................... $ 15,389,084 (1) Holders of deferred stock unit awards and restricted stock units received payments of cash and replacement cash awards at $104.00 per share. Equity awards that were vested, outstanding, and exercised immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger were automatically converted into a right to receive cash from the Company. Other equity awards that were unvested were automatically canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive an aggregate amount in cash (referred to as a converted cash award) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Citrix stock option, by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Citrix common stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Citrix stock option immediately prior to the effective time. The converted cash awards were subject to generally the same terms as the corresponding, canceled equity award, including vesting conditions. Amount includes cash consideration of $54.0 million related to vested stock awards and a non-cash assumed liability of $113.0 million related to the replacement equity awards described above. The Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). This requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value. The Company estimated, using Level 3 inputs, the fair value of fixed assets using a combination of the cost approach and the market approach. Specific to intangible assets, trade names and developed technology were valued using the relief from royalty method, a variation of the income approach, and customer relationships and maintenance agreements were valued based on the multi- period excess earnings method of the income approach. The Company has recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the purchase date (except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy).

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including foreign currency contracts. We execute foreign currency contracts primarily in the retail market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large multi-national and regional banks. The foreign currency contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the three months ended February 28, 2024 and 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

As a result, the financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in economic conditions in foreign markets. The U.S. dollar is the major transaction currency; we also transact business in approximately thirty-six foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to operations are the Euro, British pound, and Indian rupee. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are initially reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income and (loss) and are subsequently recognized in income when the hedged exposure is recognized in income. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in Other expense, net. The total cumulative unrealized gain on cash flow derivative instruments was $4.4 million as of February 28, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow derivatives are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income and (loss) in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gain as of February 28, 2024 is expected to be recognized in income over the next 12 months at the same time the hedged items are recognized in income. We enter into forward contracts with financial institutions to manage currency exposure related to variable cash flows of forecasted foreign currency expenses, and these forward contracts are generally settled within twelve months from trade dates. Our forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For those contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized currently in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on our debt.

Citrix produced certain materials related to the request, including redacted board meeting minutes.On March 7, 2023, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action.

The complaint alleges a single claim, for breach of fiduciary duty against former Citrix Chairman and CEO Robert Calderoni, in connection with the Merger. The complaint alleges that Mr. Calderoni breached his fiduciary duties by approving the proxy statement sent to shareholders soliciting approval of the Merger that was allegedly misleading and by not securing a higher purchase price for Citrix shares.

Starting on December 19, 2023, twenty-one nationwide putative class action lawsuits were filed against Citrix alleging various state law claims based on data breach incidents experienced by Company customers, where such incidents allegedly arose from exploits of CVE-2023-4966 (collectively, the “CVE-2023-4966 Class Actions”).

Following the Comcast December 18, 2023 announcement, plaintiffs filed eighteen putative class action lawsuits against Citrix in three different district courts (S.D. Florida, E.D. Pennsylvania, and South Carolina), asserting claims for negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, unjust enrichment, and other state law claims, based on Comcast’s identification of CVE-2023-4966 in connection with Comcast’s data breach. Each of the cases has either been transferred to the E.D. Pennsylvania (where Comcast is headquartered) or dismissed. There are fifteen complaints pending in the E.D. Pennsylvania concerning the Comcast data breach; all fifteen cases have been consolidated by the Court. Five different plaintiffs’ counsel filed applications for appointment as interim lead class counsel for the consolidated cases. The Court set a hearing on those applications for May 14, 2024. The foregoing cases, most of which include Comcast as a co-defendant, are referred to here as the “Comcast Data Breach Actions”. The majority of complaints in the now-consolidated Comcast Data Breach Actions erroneously allege that Citrix had possession of the Comcast customer data at the time of the breach.

The total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive performance stock option awards is $45.2 million as of February 28, 2024. These stock option incentive awards are primarily equity-classified awards as there is no requirement for cash settlement and they are only settled in shares that require a hold period of at least six months passing the risk of ownership to the option holder. The value of these equity classified stock option incentive awards is determinable as of the grant date. There is a portion of stock option incentive service units that are liability-classified given they contain an unrestricted put option at the option holder’s discretion at specified periods after the anniversary of the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option incentive awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model, whereby the allocable equity value of the Company is divided by the fully diluted shares to calculate the fair value of the underlying common stock. The stock volatility for each grant is estimated from the historical daily price changes of comparable companies. The expected term of options granted is derived from the weighted average of estimated time to fully vesting of the incentive performance stock awards through a vesting event and the contractual life of the award, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods aligns with the expected life of the option is based on the Daily U.S. Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so. We recorded approximately $75.3 million in expenses in the period after the Merger and before November 30, 2022. Of that amount, $35.7 million was expensed related to the vesting of awards paid out immediately upon the close of the Merger. The remaining $39.6 million was expensed related to the vesting of cash awards during the period after the Merger and before November 30, 2022. For the three months ended February 28, 2024, the Company recorded approximately $10.4 million in expenses. For the three months ended February 28, 2023, the Company recorded approximately $56.3 million in expenses. As of February 28, 2024, there was $5.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards. The unrecognized cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.2 years. jurisdictions by tax authorities for years prior to 2018. The statute of limitations for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 remains open for material foreign tax jurisdictions.

Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value of the ROU assets is determined by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. We re-evaluated our real estate needs, resulting in a reduction of owned space and leased space, and the impairment of the associated ROU assets and property and equipment. Due to the actions taken, we tested the operating lease ROU assets and certain property and equipment for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. Based on the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups were below the carrying values, indicating impairment. We then determined the fair value of the asset groups by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized $1.6 million which primarily consisted of depreciation expense for property and equipment and ROU lease impairment charges which were recorded as Restructuring charges on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,338

We accrue for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable.

The accruals or estimates, if any, resulting from the foregoing analysis, are reviewed at least quarterly, and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent that it is probable and reasonably estimable that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, we will, as applicable, adjust the accrual in the period the determination is made, disclose an estimate of the additional loss or range of loss, indicate that the estimate is immaterial with respect to our financial statements as a whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate cannot be made.

The Company maintains certain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. The Company’s effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on earnings generated by our foreign operations that are taxed primarily in Switzerland and Ireland. For the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized an effective tax rate of approximately (24.3)% and net tax expense of $9.05 million. During the three months ended February 28, 2024, we recognized a discrete tax expense of $10.4 million, primarily due to a change in tax reserves of $6.7 million. The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2024, was primarily due to a valuation allowance against the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation. For the three months ended February 28, 2023, we recognized an effective tax rate of approximately (5.6)% and net tax expense of $32.7 million.

The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023, was primarily due to the expense related to the valuation allowance against the Section 163(j) interest expense limitation.
