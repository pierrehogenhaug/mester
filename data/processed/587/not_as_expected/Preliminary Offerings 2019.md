Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” and, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “ADT,” “we,” “our,” and “us”),
are offering $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 (the “Unsecured Notes”).
In a concurrent transaction, the Issuers are also offering $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % First-Priority
Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % First-Priority Senior

The Unsecured Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum and will mature on, 2027. Interest on the
Unsecured Notes will be payable semi-annually on and of each year, commencing on, 2019.
The proceeds from the offering of the Unsecured Notes will be used to repurchase or redeem $1,246 million aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Prime Notes (as defined herein). The proceeds from the offering of the First-Priority Notes will be used to (a)
repurchase or redeem $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes and (b) repay $500.0 million of
outstanding term loans under our First Lien Credit Agreement (as defined herein). If the offerings of the Senior Unsecured Notes and
the First-Priority Notes are both successfully consummated, the Issuers expect to repurchase or redeem all outstanding Prime Notes.
The Unsecured Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Issuer’s wholly owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries that guarantees our First Lien Credit Agreement (as defined herein). Subject to certain exceptions, to the
extent lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement release the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor, such subsidiary
guarantor will also be released from its obligations under the Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes and guarantees will
(i) rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior indebtedness, (ii) rank senior to all of the
Issuers’ future subordinated indebtedness, (iii) be pari passu with all of the Issuers’ future unsecured indebtedness, (iv) be
effectively junior to all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral, including indebtedness
under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes (as defined herein) and the First-Priority Notes, to the extent of the value
of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and (v) be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of the Issuers’
subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the Unsecured Notes.
We may redeem some or all of the Unsecured Notes at any time at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum. We may be required to redeem the Unsecured Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if we experience a change of control. There is no sinking fund for the Unsecured
Notes. See “Description of Unsecured Notes.”
We are not obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the Unsecured Notes for
resale or to exchange the Unsecured Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Unsecured Notes on any
securities exchange or for inclusion of the Unsecured Notes in any automated quotation system.
**Investing in the Unsecured Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15.**
Price of the Unsecured Notes: % plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from, 2019

This offering memorandum has been prepared by us based on information we have or have
obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. Summaries of documents contained in this
offering memorandum may not be complete, and we refer you to such documents for a more
complete understanding of what we discuss in this offering memorandum. The initial

We are offering the Unsecured Notes in reliance on exemptions from registration under the

representations and warranties as detailed under “Notice to Investors.” You may be required to

Each prospective purchaser of the Unsecured Notes must comply with all applicable laws

Notes and must obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase,
offer or sale by it of the Unsecured Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any

this offering.

### NO SEC REVIEW

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state**
**securities commission has approved or disapproved of the Unsecured Notes or**
**determined if this offering memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation**
**to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information
that would be required if this offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with
the SEC. This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this
offering, will not be reviewed by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the
Unsecured Notes, and we have no intention to offer notes in a transaction registered under the
Securities Act in exchange for the Unsecured Notes or to file a registration statement with
respect to the Unsecured Notes. The indenture governing the Unsecured Notes will not be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”).

### USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

To provide to holders of the Unsecured Notes additional information in connection with our
results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (“GAAP”), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as non-GAAP measures.
These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not
be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other
measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.

iii


-----

**Adjusted EBITDA**

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional
information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not
expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe
Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for
evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our
performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes,
(iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other
fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred
costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based
compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger,
restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses, (ix) financing and
consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio
conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take
into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes,
and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best
addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by
considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with
GAAP.

**Free Cash Flow**

We believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional
information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay
dividends.

We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related
to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant,
and equipment; subscriber system asset additions and deferred subscriber installation costs;
and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of
our authorized dealer network. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating
activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business
activities.

Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to
direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most
comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for
discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary
expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in
combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.
All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum,

“could,” “may,” “should,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,”

with possible future events and is forward-looking in nature. However, the absence of these
words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. For ADT,
particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those
expressed in our forward-looking statements include, without limitation:

   - our ability to launch new product and service offerings that achieve market acceptance
with acceptable margins;

   - changes in law, economic and financial conditions, including tax law changes, changes
to privacy requirements, changes to telemarketing, email marketing and similar
consumer protection laws, interest and exchange rate volatility, and trade tariffs
applicable to the products we sell;

   - the impact of potential information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches;

   - the other factors that are described in this report under the heading “Risk Factors.”

These forward-looking statements reflect our views with respect to future events as of the
date of this offering memorandum and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and
uncertainties. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in
conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included or incorporated by reference
in this offering memorandum and in other filings. Given these uncertainties, you should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this offering memorandum and,
except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or review publicly any forwardlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise after the

date of this prospectus. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our
views to change. You should read this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated
by reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be
materially different from what we expect. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the
potential impact of any future acquisitions, merger, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments
we may undertake. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary
statements.

**The Transactions**

We intend to execute a series of transactions in connection with this offering.

**_Credit Agreement Amendment_**

On March 15, 2019, the Issuer, as borrower, Prime Security Services Holdings, LLC, as
holdings (“Holdings”), the lenders party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as the administrative
agent thereunder entered into that certain Amendment Agreement No. 8 (the “Credit
Agreement Amendment”), which amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement (as
defined in “Description of Other Indebtedness.”) The Credit Agreement Amendment amended
the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things, (a) increase the Net First Lien Leverage
Ratio (as defined therein) for the incurrence of pari passu indebtedness to 3.20 to 1.00 (from 2.35
to 1.00), (b) provide for $300 million of additional incremental pari passu debt capacity,
(c) increase the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional
$50 million, which replaced the revolving credit commitments under the Mizuho Agreement (as


1


-----

defined below) and (d) make several other changes to provide the Issuer with additional
flexibility to de-lever its balance sheet and opportunistically refinance existing indebtedness.
The effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment is subject to market and other
conditions, and the prepayment of $500.0 million term loans outstanding under the First Lien
Credit Agreement with the proceeds of this offering and of the offering of the First-Priority
Notes.

Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Issuer will
terminate that certain revolving credit agreement, dated February 15, 2019, by and among the
Issuer, as borrower, Holdings, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Mizuho Bank,
Ltd., as administrative agent (the “Mizuho Agreement”).

**_Offering of First-Priority Notes_**

Concurrently with this offering, we are offering $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount
of % First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and $750,000,000
aggregate principal amount of % First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026
Notes”, and, together with the 2024 Notes, the “First-Priority Notes”), which we expect will
close concurrently with the closing of this offering. The consummation of this offering is not
contingent upon the consummation of the offering of the First-Priority Notes. Additionally, the
consummation of the offering of the First-Priority Notes is not contingent upon the
consummation of this offering. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Unsecured Notes—The consummation of the offering of the Unsecured Notes and the
consummation of the offering of the First-Priority Notes are not contingent on each other.”

The 2024 Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum and will mature on,
2024. The 2026 Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum and will mature on,
2026. Interest on the First-Priority Notes will be payable semi-annually on and
of each year, commencing on, 2019. The First-Priority Notes will be fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Issuer’s wholly owned domestic restricted
subsidiaries that guarantees our First Lien Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, to
the extent lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement release the guarantee of any subsidiary
guarantor, such subsidiary guarantor will also be released from its obligations under the FirstPriority Notes. The First-Priority Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority
security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of our existing and future assets,
which assets also secure our First Lien Credit Agreement and certain other debt, as further
described in this offering memorandum. The First-Priority Notes and guarantees will (i) rank
equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior indebtedness,
(ii) rank senior to all of the Issuers’ future subordinated indebtedness, (iii) be effectively senior
to the Unsecured Notes and all of the Issuers’ future unsecured indebtedness, to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing the First-Priority Notes, (iv) equal to all of the Issuer’s
existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis,
including indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the ADT Notes (as defined
herein), to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, (v) effectively
senior to all of the Issuers’ future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a juniorpriority basis to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the First-Priority Notes and
(vi) structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of the Issuers’ subsidiaries that is not a
guarantor of the Unsecured Notes.

Notes.”

**_Tender Offer for Prime Notes_**

On March 18, 2019, the Issuers commenced a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase
for cash up to $2,246 million outstanding principal amount of 9.250% Second-Priority Secured
Notes (the “Prime Notes”) of the Issuers. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
$2,246 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes were outstanding, and accrued
and unpaid interest on the Prime Notes was $71.0 million. The purchase for cash of
$2,246 million outstanding principal amount of Prime Notes contemplated by the Tender Offer is
conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the offering of the Unsecured Notes and
the closing of the offering of the First-Priority Notes. If neither the offering of the Unsecured
Notes nor the offering of the First-Priority Notes is consummated, the Issuers will not purchase
any Prime Notes tendered in the Tender Offer. If either the offering of the Unsecured Notes or
the offering of the First-Priority Notes is not consummated, the Issuers will purchase Prime
Notes tendered in the Tender Offer in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000 million and
$1,246 million, respectively.

Nothing in this offering memorandum should be construed as an offer to purchase any
Prime Notes, as the Tender Offer is being made only to the recipients of an Offer to Purchase,
dated as of March 18, 2019, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

**_Redemption of Prime Notes_**

On March 18, 2019, the Issuers issued a conditional notice of redemption with respect to the
Prime Notes in accordance with the indenture governing such notes. We intend to redeem any
Prime Notes not tendered in the Tender Offer in an aggregate amount not to exceed the
aggregate proceeds received as a result of this offering and the offering of the First-Priority
Notes. For example, if the offering of the Unsecured Notes and the offering of the First-Priority
Notes are both consummated and assuming no Prime Notes are tendered in the Tender Offer,
we intend to redeem all such Prime Notes (the “Full Redemption”) and simultaneously to
discharge our obligations with respect to such Prime Notes and the indenture governing such
Prime Notes in accordance with the terms of that indenture. If the offering of the Unsecured
Notes is consummated but the offering of the First-Priority Notes is not consummated and
assuming no Prime Notes are tendered in the Tender Offer, we intend to redeem such Prime
Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1,000 million (the “Partial Redemption” and,
together with the Full Redemption, the “Redemption”). The Redemption is conditioned upon the
closing of the offering of the Unsecured Notes.

Throughout this offering memorandum, we collectively refer to this offering, the execution
of the Credit Agreement Amendment, the offering of the First-Priority Notes, the Tender Offer
and the Redemption as the “Transactions.” See “—Sources and Uses of Funds” for additional
detail regarding the Transactions.

The proceeds from the offering of the Unsecured Notes will be used to repurchase or
redeem $1,246 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes. The proceeds
from the offering of the First-Priority Notes will be used to (a) repurchase or redeem $1,000
million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes and (b) repay $500.0 million of
outstanding term loans under our First Lien Credit Agreement. If the offerings of the Senior
Unsecured Notes and the First-Priority Notes are both successfully consummated, the Issuers
expect to repurchase or redeem all outstanding Prime Notes.

(6) As of December 31, 2018, $2,546 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes
were outstanding, $300 million of which were redeemed on February 1, 2019. Assumes that
the Issuers (a) will purchase no Prime Notes in the Tender Offer and (b) will redeem the
entire outstanding $2,246 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Prime
Notes on April 17, 2019, and pay all accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable
redemption premium on such Prime Notes to, but excluding, such date, in accordance with
the indenture governing the Prime Notes, which we expect will amount to approximately
$114.3 million. The Prime Notes have a maturity date of May 2, 2023 and bear interest at a
9.250%. As of the date hereof, accrued and unpaid interest on the Prime Notes was $71.0
million. Prior to May 15, 2019, the Issuers may redeem the Prime Notes at their option, in
whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

(7) Represents the prepayment of $500.0 million term loans outstanding under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, which is a condition to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement
Amendment.

(8) Reflects the estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including entry
into the Credit Agreement Amendment, the offering of the Unsecured Notes, the offering of
the First-Priority Notes, the Tender Offer, the Redemption, placement and other financing
fees, advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees, including any initial
purchasers’ commissions in connection with the offering of the Unsecured Notes. We
intend to pay all fees and expenses associated with the Transactions with cash on hand
and/or drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility.

such indebtedness; and

                    - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each
of the Issuers’ subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of

the Unsecured Notes would have ranked effectively junior
to $8,774 million face value of indebtedness drawn under
the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Facility, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes (with a
further $300 million available for borrowing under the
Revolving Credit Facility, without giving effect to the letters
of credit). As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full
Redemption), the Unsecured Notes would not be
structurally subordinated to any indebtedness of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries. See “Description of Unsecured
Notes—Ranking.”

As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption),
non-guarantor subsidiaries held less than 5% of our
consolidated assets and had no outstanding indebtedness,
excluding intercompany obligations and capital leases.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the
Full Redemption), including this offering, non-guarantor
subsidiaries generated approximately 5% of our total pro
forma revenue and less than 5% of our Adjusted EBITDA.

Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . None.

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . The Unsecured Notes are redeemable, at our option, in part

Unsecured Notes plus a “make-whole” amount, plus in
each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the redemption date. See “Description of Unsecured
Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Redemption of Unsecured Notes
for Tax Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem all, but not part, of the Unsecured Notes
upon the occurrence of specified tax events described in
the accompanying prospectus under “Description of

Change of Control Offer to
Repurchase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If a Change of Control as defined under “Description of

must offer to repurchase the Unsecured Notes at a
repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the repurchase date. See “Description of Unsecured
Notes—Change of Control.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture will include requirements that will, among
other things, restrict the ability of the Issuers and, as
applicable, the Guarantors to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                  - pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or
repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted
payments;

                  - make investments;

                   - consummate certain asset sales;

                     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                     - agree to any restrictions on the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to make payments to us;

                     - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of
our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.”

In addition, certain of the covenants will be suspended if
both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc., assign the Unsecured Notes an
investment grade rating in the future and certain other
conditions are met. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—
Certain Covenants.” In the event that we and our restricted
subsidiaries are not subject to such covenants for any
period of time as a result of the preceding sentence and, on
any subsequent date, one or both of such rating agencies
withdraws or downgrades the ratings assigned to the
Unsecured Notes or a default or event of default occurs
and is continuing under the indenture relating to the
Unsecured Notes, then we and our restricted subsidiaries
will thereafter again be subject to such covenants.

Transfer Restrictions; No
Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . The Unsecured Notes have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities
laws. The Unsecured Notes are subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or sold,
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” Holders of the
Unsecured Notes will not be entitled to any registration
rights, and we will not be required to complete a registered
exchange offer or file a shelf registration statement for
resales of the Unsecured Notes. We do not intend to issue
registered notes in exchange for the Unsecured Notes and
the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the
transferability of the Unsecured Notes. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured
Notes—There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or
resell the Unsecured Notes without registration or the filing
of a prospectus under applicable securities laws, and the
Unsecured Notes are not subject to any future registration
rights or obligations.”

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We will use the proceeds from the offering of the
Unsecured Notes to repurchase or redeem $1,246 million
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes.
We will use the proceeds from the offering of the FirstPriority Notes to (a) repurchase or redeem $1,000 million
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes
and (b) repay $500.0 million of outstanding term loans
under our First Lien Credit Agreement. If the offerings of
the Senior Unsecured Notes and the First-Priority Notes are
both successfully consummated, we expect to repurchase
or redeem all outstanding Prime Notes. We intend to pay
all fees and expenses associated with the Transactions with
cash on hand and/or drawings under our Revolving Credit
Facility. See “—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Unsecured Notes will be new securities for which there
is currently no public trading market. Although certain of
the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Unsecured Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making
activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Unsecured
Notes will develop or be maintained. We do not intend to
list or apply to list the Unsecured Notes on any securities
exchange or for quotation through any automated
quotation system. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Unsecured Notes—Your ability to
transfer the Unsecured Notes may be limited by the
absence of an active trading market, and there is no
assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if
developed be maintained, for the Unsecured Notes.”

-----

Book-Entry Form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Unsecured Notes will be issued in registered book-entry
form represented by one or more global notes to be
deposited with or on behalf of DTC or its nominee. Transfers
of the Unsecured Notes will only be effected through
facilities of DTC. Beneficial interests in the global notes may
not be exchanged for certificated notes except in limited
circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Additional Unsecured Notes . . . . From time to time, without notice to, or the consent of, the
holders of the Unsecured Notes, the Issuers may issue
other debt securities under the indenture in addition to the
Unsecured Notes, increase the principal amount of the
Unsecured Notes that may be issued under the indenture
and issue additional Unsecured Notes in the future. Any
additional Unsecured Notes will have the same terms as
the Unsecured Notes being offered by this offering
memorandum but may be offered at a different offering
price or have a different issue date, interest accrual date or
initial interest payment date than the Unsecured Notes
being offered by this offering memorandum. If issued,
these additional Unsecured Notes will become part of the
same series as the Unsecured Notes being offered by this
offering memorandum, including for purposes of voting,
redemptions and offers to purchase. If any additional
Unsecured Notes are issued at a price that causes such
additional Unsecured Notes to have more than a de
minimis amount of “original issue discount” within the
meaning of Section 1273 of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations of the
United States Department of Treasury thereunder (the
“Code”), such additional Unsecured Notes may not have
the same CUSIP number as the Unsecured Notes offered
by this offering memorandum.

Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The governing law for the Unsecured Notes and the
indenture is New York.

Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . You should carefully consider the information set forth
herein under “Risk Factors” and in the section entitled
“Risk Factors” in the 2018 Annual Report and the other
information included or incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum in deciding whether to purchase the
Unsecured Notes.

make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that
calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and
refinements in the ordinary course of business. These refinements, for example, may
include changes due to systems conversion or historical methodology differences in legacy
systems.

(2) RMR is generated by contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring
services provided to our customers, including contracts monitored but not owned. We
believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under
contract at a given point in time.

(3) Gross customer revenue attrition is defined as the RMR lost as a result of customer attrition,
net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not
owned. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer
charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the
customer canceled service during the charge-back period, generally twelve to fifteen
months.

Gross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the
numerator of which is the annualized RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of
dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not
owned, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR
under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.

Gross customer revenue attrition for 2016 is presented on a pro forma basis for The ADT
Corporation business.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful to investors to measure
the operational strength and performance of our business and to provide additional
information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do
not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we
believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because
we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and
comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes,
(iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and
other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization
of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) sharebased compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP,
(vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses,
(ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on
extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other
charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take
into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest,
taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations
are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items
independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

### RISK FACTORS

_In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this offering_
_memorandum, including the matters addressed under “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-_
_Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risks before investing in the_
_Unsecured Notes._

_You should also read the risk factors and other cautionary statements, including those_
_described under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the 2018 Annual Report filed by ADT Inc.,_
_which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum._

_We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties due to the nature of the business activities_
_we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, are not the only risks we_
_face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us; or, as a_
_result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be_
_immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash_
_flows, and results of operations._

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to raise_**
**_additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in_**
**_the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under_**
**_the Unsecured Notes._**

We are a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), we would have had
$10,024 million face value of outstanding indebtedness (excluding capital leases). On a pro
forma basis giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), we will have total
debt service payments of $ million (including approximately $ million of debt service
relating to fixed rate obligations) for the first year following the consummation of the
Transactions.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you as a holder of the
Unsecured Notes. For example, it could:

   - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt
service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;

   - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness,
including the Unsecured Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of
our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could
result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes and the
agreements governing other indebtedness;

   - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other
purposes;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

   - make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a
competitive disadvantage;

   - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;

15


-----

   - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities,
introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

   - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

   - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness,
among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets;

   - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Unsecured Notes tendered
to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase
would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes; or

   - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including
borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest.

In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the ADT Notes,
the Unsecured Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes contain, or will
contain, restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our
long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of
default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our
indebtedness.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be_**
**_able to make payments on the Unsecured Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that are not waived by the
required holders and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could leave us
unable to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Unsecured Notes and could
substantially decrease the market value of the Unsecured Notes. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required
payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail
to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the
instruments governing our indebtedness (including the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT
Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes), we could be in default under the
terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders
of such indebtedness could elect to (i) declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and
payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, (ii) terminate their commitments and cease
making further loans and (iii) institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could
be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the
required lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the holders of the ADT Notes, the
Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes to avoid being in default. If we breach our
covenants under the documents governing our indebtedness and seek a waiver, we may not be
able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders, as applicable. If this occurs, we
would be in default under the documents governing our indebtedness, the lenders or holders,
as applicable, could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Unsecured
Notes” and “Description of First-Priority Notes.”

Upon any such bankruptcy filing, under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the
“Bankruptcy Code”), we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the
Unsecured Notes, and the holders of the Unsecured Notes would not be entitled to receive postpetition interest or applicable fees, costs or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations

16


-----

due under the Unsecured Notes exceeded the value of the collateral (after taking into account all
other senior debt that was also secured by the collateral), or any “adequate protection” on
account of any undersecured portion of the Unsecured Notes.

**_Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly_**
**_more debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our substantial_**
**_indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future.
Although the terms of the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes and agreements governing
our other indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur
additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a
number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent
us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), we
would have had approximately $300 million available for additional borrowing under the
Revolving Credit Facility (without giving effect to letters of credit), all of which would be secured
on a first-priority basis. In addition to the Unsecured Notes and our indebtedness under the First
Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes, the
covenants under any other existing or future debt instruments could allow us to incur a
significant amount of additional indebtedness. The more leveraged we become, the more we,
and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under “—Our
substantial indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional
capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our
industry and prevent us from making debt service payments on the Unsecured Notes.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness,_**
**_including the Unsecured Notes, and to fund our working capital and capital_**
**_expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under our indebtedness that may not be successful._**

Our ability to pay principal and interest on the Unsecured Notes and to satisfy our other
debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:

   - our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost
savings described herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and
competitive conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control;

   - our future ability to refinance or restructure our existing debt obligations, which
depends on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets, our financial
condition, and the terms of existing or future debt agreements; and

   - our future ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which
depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit
agreement governing such facilities.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or
that we will be able to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount
sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on the
Unsecured Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may
be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or

17


-----

restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes. These alternative
measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service
obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the
capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt
agreements, including the instruments governing the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT
Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes, may restrict us from adopting some
of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations
to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those
dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from
any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.
Investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC, its
subsidiaries, and its affiliates, who collectively are our controlling shareholder, have no
continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to generate
sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, could result in a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and could negatively impact our ability to
satisfy our obligations under the Unsecured Notes.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and
holders of the Unsecured Notes, the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority
Notes and lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement could declare all outstanding principal
and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could
terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders (including the lenders under
our First Lien Credit Agreement and the holders of the Unsecured Notes, the ADT Notes, the
Prime Notes (if any) and the First-Priority Notes) could foreclose against the assets securing the
indebtedness owing to them, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these
events could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the Unsecured Notes.

If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to repay or refinance all or a portion of our
indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes, before maturity. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

**_Changes in our credit rating could negatively impact the market price or liquidity_**
**_of the Unsecured Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow,
including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their
credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. Additionally, we cannot be sure
that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the Unsecured Notes. A negative
change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices of the
Unsecured Notes and on our ability to secure future debt financing on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.

**_Repayment of our debt, including the Unsecured Notes, is dependent on cash_**
**_flow generated by our subsidiaries._**

The Issuers are holding companies and have no direct operations other than holding the
equity interests in our subsidiaries and activities directly related thereto. Accordingly,

18


-----

repayment of our indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes, is dependent on the generation
of cash flow by our subsidiaries and, if they are not guarantors of the Unsecured Notes, their
ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they
are guarantors of the Unsecured Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay
amounts due on the Unsecured Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to
make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes. Each of our
subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual
restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from them and we may be limited in our ability
to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us. While the First Lien Credit
Agreement limits, and the indentures governing the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the
First-Priority Notes limit, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are
subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions
from our non-guarantor subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest
payments on our indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes.

**_The Unsecured Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our_**
**_current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

The Unsecured Notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities
of our current and future subsidiaries that are not or will not be guaranteeing the Unsecured
Notes, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will have
priority as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will
pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors
before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. During the year ended
December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the
Full Redemption), non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 5% of our total revenue
and less than 5% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), non-guarantor subsidiaries
held less than 5% of our consolidated assets and had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding
intercompany obligations and capital leases.

In addition, the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes will permit non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount
of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

The Unsecured Notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any
subsidiaries that are not material or wholly owned. These non-guarantor subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any
amounts due pursuant to the Unsecured Notes, or to make any funds available therefore,
whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the
subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon
the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of
Unsecured Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors
and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries.

19


-----

**_The lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the discretion to_**
**_release any guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement in a variety of_**
**_circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their_**
**_guarantees of the Unsecured Notes._**

While any obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement remain outstanding, any
guarantee of the Unsecured Notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder
of the Unsecured Notes or the trustee under the indentures that will govern the Unsecured
Notes, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any other indebtedness. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Subsidiary
Guarantees” and “Description of First-Priority Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.” The lenders
under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the discretion to release the guarantees under
the First Lien Credit Agreement in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a
creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the Unsecured Notes, and the
indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of
those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating_**
**_our business._**

The First Lien Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Prime Notes (if any) and
the Unsecured Notes contain, and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely
contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on
us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

   - incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness, or issue certain preferred equity
interests;

   - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our
capital stock or make other restricted payments;

   - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

   - make loans or certain investments;

   - sell certain assets;

   - create liens on certain assets;

   - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

   - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

   - alter the businesses we conduct;

   - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

   - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial
covenants. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—First Lien Credit Agreement–Revolving
Credit Facility.”

As a result of these covenants, we will continue to be limited in the manner in which we
conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or
finance future operations or capital needs.

A failure to comply with the covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness
or any of our other future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or

20


-----

waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In the event of any such default, the lenders thereunder:

   - will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;

   - could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid
interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable;

   - could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or

   - could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the Unsecured
Notes;

any of which could result in an event of default under the Unsecured Notes.

Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we
were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement could
proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a
significant portion of our assets as collateral under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement or our other
indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes, were to be accelerated, there can be no
assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Unsecured Notes.”

**_Because each subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced_**
**_to zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive_**
**_any payments from some or all of the subsidiary guarantors._**

The guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that such
guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, any such guarantor’s
liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully below, a
court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could avoid the
obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor.
See “—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the
Unsecured Notes and guarantees, and require holders of Unsecured Notes to return payments
received.”

In addition, the subsidiary guarantors will be automatically released from their guarantees
upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following:

   - the designation of a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

   - the release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation
of the guarantee of the Unsecured Notes by a subsidiary guarantor; or

   - the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all the assets, of a
subsidiary guarantor.

If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor is released, no holder of the Unsecured Notes
will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities,
including trade payables and preferred equity interests, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of
that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the Unsecured Notes.
See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

21


-----

**_There are limited covenants and protections in the indenture._**

While the indenture and the Unsecured Notes contain terms intended to provide protection
to holders upon the occurrence of certain events involving significant corporate transactions
and our creditworthiness, these terms are limited and may not be sufficient to protect your
investment in the Unsecured Notes. For example, there are no financial covenants in the
indenture. In addition, as described under “Description of Unsecured Notes—Change of
Control,” upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuers are required to offer to all
holders the right to redeem their Unsecured Notes at 101% of their principal amount. However,
the definition of the term “Change of Control” is limited and does not cover a variety of
transactions (such as acquisitions by us, recapitalizations, reorganizations, ventures, mergers,
“going private” or similar transactions by us or our affiliates) that could negatively affect the
value of your Unsecured Notes. A change of control transaction under the indenture may only
occur if there is either (i) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or (ii) a change in the
majority of the voting interest in our business coupled with the acquisition by a third-party of an
entitlement to receive more than 50% of our equity distributions or partner allocations. If we
were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the
Unsecured Notes, but would not constitute a change of control, you would not have any rights
to require the Issuers to repurchase the Unsecured Notes prior to their maturity, which also
would adversely affect your investment.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Unsecured Notes upon a change of_**
**_control._**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we will be
required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding Unsecured Notes at 101% of the principal
amount thereof plus, without duplication, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
Additionally, under the First Lien Credit Agreement, a change of control constitutes an event of
default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings and terminate their
commitments to lend under the Revolving Credit Facility. The source of funds for any
repurchase of the Unsecured Notes, the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any) and the FirstPriority Notes and repayment of borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement would be our
available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including
borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds
at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of Unsecured Notes or that
restrictions in our other debt documents will not allow such repurchases. We may require
additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases, and we may be unable to
obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Unsecured
Notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged
recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a
change of control under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes. See “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Change of Control.”

Courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which will be the
governing law of the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes) have not provided clear and
consistent meanings of such change of control provisions, which leads to subjective judicial
interpretation. In addition, a court case in Delaware has questioned whether a change of control
provision contained in an indenture could be unenforceable on public policy grounds.

22


-----

**_We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control_**
**_that could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Unsecured_**
**_Notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the
indenture governing the Unsecured Notes may allow us to enter into transactions, such as
acquisitions, refinancing or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a change of control but
may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to satisfy our
obligations under the Unsecured Notes. The definition of change of control for purposes of the
Unsecured Notes includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of our
assets taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, your ability to require us to repurchase Unsecured Notes as a result of a transfer of
less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid_**
**_the Unsecured Notes and guarantees, and require holders of Unsecured Notes to_**
**_return payments received._**

If we or any guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code or
encounters other financial difficulty, under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer
law a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the Unsecured Notes or the guarantees. A
court might do so if it found that when we issued the Unsecured Notes or the subsidiary
guarantor entered into its guarantee, or in some states when payments became due under the
Unsecured Notes or the guarantees, we or the subsidiary guarantor received less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

   - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

   - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business;

   - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability
to pay; or

   - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money
damages docketed against us or the subsidiary guarantor if, in either case, the judgment
is unsatisfied after final judgment.

The court might also avoid an issuance of Unsecured Notes or a guarantee, without regard
to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the Unsecured Notes or the applicable
guarantor entered into its guarantee with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its
creditors.

A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for the Unsecured Notes or its guarantee if we or a guarantor did not
substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Unsecured Notes. Thus, if the
guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the
guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the
obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Unsecured Notes or any
guarantee, you would no longer have any claim against the Issuers or the applicable guarantor.
Sufficient funds to repay the Unsecured Notes may not be available from other sources,
including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any
amounts that you already received from us or a guarantor. In the event of a finding that a

23


-----

fraudulent conveyance or transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the
Unsecured Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Unsecured Notes could result in an event of
default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of
that debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws
will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent
conveyance or transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered
insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all
of its assets;

   - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities,
as they become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot assure you as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we
or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our
conclusions in this regard, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not
determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the
holders of the Unsecured Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences,
fraudulent conveyances or transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Unsecured
Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt.

Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to
limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, this
provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided
under fraudulent conveyance or transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the Unsecured Notes or by a guarantor under a
guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided
and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such
guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a
bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and such payment would give the
recipient more than it would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the
Unsecured Notes or guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under
the principle of “equitable subordination” if the court determines that (a) the holder of
Unsecured Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct
resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of
Unsecured Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could_**
**_cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and
expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain

24


-----

of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the
same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop collecting LIBOR rates from banks after
2021. The announcement indicates that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. We
are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any
alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may
be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements
relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked
securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us. As
such, LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial
condition.

We have entered into, and in the future we continue to enter into, interest rate swaps that
involve the exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments to reduce interest rate
volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable
rate indebtedness, and any such swaps may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove
disadvantageous, or may create additional risks. As of December 31, 2018, assuming our
Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in interest rates would result in a
$2 million change in annual interest expense, including the impact of our interest rate swaps, on
indebtedness under our First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Unsecured Notes_**
**_without registration or the filing of a prospectus under applicable securities_**
**_laws, and the Unsecured Notes are not subject to any future registration rights or_**
**_obligations._**

The Unsecured Notes are being issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state and securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the
Unsecured Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may
be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. We will not be
obligated to offer to exchange the Unsecured Notes for notes registered under the Securities
Act or to register the reoffer and resale of Unsecured Notes under applicable securities laws. As
a result, the transferability of the Unsecured Notes may be negatively affected. By receiving the
Unsecured Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations
and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, the indenture governing
the Unsecured Notes will not be qualified under the TIA and the Issuers will not be required to
comply with the provisions of the TIA. Therefore, holders of the Unsecured Notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the TIA or similar provisions in the
indenture governing the Unsecured Notes.

**_Your ability to transfer the Unsecured Notes may be limited by the absence of an_**
**_active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market_**
**_will develop, or if developed be maintained, for the Unsecured Notes._**

The Unsecured Notes are each a new issue of securities for which there is no established
public trading market. We do not intend to have the Unsecured Notes listed on a national
securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system. Affiliates of the initial
purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Unsecured Notes, if issued,
as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, but they are not obligated to make a market in
any of the Unsecured Notes, and they may discontinue their market making activities at any

25


-----

time without notice. Therefore, an active market for any of the Unsecured Notes may not
develop or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any market for the Unsecured
Notes will depend upon the number of holders of the Unsecured Notes, our performance, the
market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the
Unsecured Notes and other factors. A liquid trading market may not develop for the Unsecured
Notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the
Unsecured Notes may be materially and adversely affected. The market, if any, for any of the
Unsecured Notes may not be free from disruptions that may cause substantial volatility in the
price of the Unsecured Notes, and any such disruptions may materially and adversely affect the
prices at which you may sell your Unsecured Notes. In addition, the Unsecured Notes may trade
at a discount from their value on the date you acquired the Unsecured Notes, depending upon
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the Unsecured Notes at maturity._**

At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Notes, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will become due and payable. We may not have the funds to
fulfill these obligations or the ability to renegotiate these obligations. If, upon the maturity date,
other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the Unsecured Notes, we could try to obtain
waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we
could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. In these circumstances,
if we were not able to obtain such waivers or refinance these borrowings, we would be unable
to repay the Unsecured Notes.

**_The market price for the Unsecured Notes may be volatile and may require you to_**
**_hold the Unsecured Notes for an indefinite period of time._**

The market for investment grade debt, such as the Unsecured Notes, may become subject
to disruptions that may cause substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the
Unsecured Notes. Any market that may develop for the Unsecured Notes may be subject to
similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may negatively impact the value of your Unsecured
Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Unsecured Notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market
for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_The Unsecured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore_**
**_holders must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise_**
**_their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until certificated notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the
Unsecured Notes, owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders
of Unsecured Notes. Instead, DTC, or its nominee, will be the sole holder of the Unsecured
Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the
Unsecured Notes in global form will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to
DTC. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to DTC participants’ accounts that hold bookentry interests in the Unsecured Notes in global form and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. Unlike holders of the Unsecured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry
interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for
waivers or other actions from holders of the Unsecured Notes. Instead, if a holder owns a bookentry interest, such holder will be permitted to act only to the extent such holder has received
appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, a participant. We cannot assure holders
that the procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable
holders to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

26


-----

**_The Unsecured Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal_**
**_income tax purposes._**

If the Unsecured Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity exceeds their “issue price,” as
determined under U.S. Treasury regulations, by more than a statutory de minimis amount, the
Unsecured Notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If the Unsecured Notes are issued with OID, in addition to including stated
interest as ordinary interest income in accordance with a U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax
accounting, each U.S. Holder must include OID in gross income as ordinary income regardless
of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method. A U.S. Holder must include OID in income as it
accrues calculated on a constant yield to maturity method before the receipt of cash attributable
to the income, and will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID
over the life of the Unsecured Notes. The rules governing instruments with OID are complex.
Prospective investors should see “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for
additional information and are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
application of such rules to the Unsecured Notes.

**_If the Unsecured Notes are issued with OID, and a bankruptcy petition were filed_**
**_by or against us, the allowed claim for the Unsecured Notes may be less than the_**
**_principal amount of the Unsecured Notes stated in the indenture governing the_**
**_Unsecured Notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the Bankruptcy Code after the
issuance of the Unsecured Notes, the claim by any holder of the Unsecured Notes for the
principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal to the sum of:

   - the original issue price of the Unsecured Notes; and

   - that portion of the stated principal amount of the Unsecured Notes that exceeds the
issue price thereof, if any, that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the
purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would
constitute unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the
Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, holders of the Unsecured Notes under these circumstances may
receive an amount that is less than the principal amount thereof stated in the indenture
governing the Unsecured Notes.

**_Delivery of any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that such_**
**_guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Certain guarantees will be granted after the issue date of the Unsecured Notes. If such
guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after the issue date of the Unsecured
Notes, any guarantees delivered after the issue date of the Unsecured Notes would face a
greater risk than guarantees in place on the issue date of being avoided by the guarantor (as
debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a
preference under bankruptcy law if certain events or circumstances exist or occur.

Specifically, guarantees issued after the issue date of the Unsecured Notes may be treated
under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to guarantee previously existing indebtedness.
Any future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the Unsecured Notes, including
pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the Unsecured Notes
are issued, may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the guarantor is
insolvent at the time of the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the issuance of the guarantee permits

27


-----

the holders of the Unsecured Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7
case than if the guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the
guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain
circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy
protection after the issue date of the Unsecured Notes and any guarantees not issued on the
issue date of the Unsecured Notes (as applicable) had been issued, less than 90 days before
commencement of such bankruptcy case, such guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a
preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of
the Unsecured Notes (even if the other guarantees issued on the issue date of the Unsecured
Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such
guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the guarantee.

**_The Unsecured Notes will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to our_**
**_existing and future secured indebtedness._**

The Unsecured Notes will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to our existing and
future secured debt (including the Unsecured Notes, the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any)
and the First-Priority Notes and the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement), to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. On a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), we expect to have $8,674 million of
secured indebtedness, consisting of the $1,500 million First-Priority Notes, $3,750 million ADT
Notes, $3,424 million of borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and $100 million of
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. We also expect to have $300 million of
additional secured debt borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The indenture
governing the Unsecured Notes will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness in the
future. Upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of our secured indebtedness,
or in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, any
indebtedness that is secured and therefore effectively senior to the Unsecured Notes will be
entitled to be paid in full from our assets securing such indebtedness before any payment may
be made with respect to the Unsecured Notes. As a result, the holders of the Unsecured Notes
may receive less than the holders of secured debt in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution or reorganization. Further, holders of the Unsecured Notes will
participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the
same class as the Unsecured Notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors,
based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in our remaining assets.

**_The consummation of the offering of the Unsecured Notes and the_**
**_consummation of the offering of the First-Priority Notes are not contingent on_**
**_each other._**

The consummation of the offering of the Unsecured Notes is not contingent upon the
consummation of the offering of the First-Priority Notes. Additionally, the consummation of the
offering of the First-Priority Notes is not contingent upon the consummation of the offering of
the Unsecured Notes. If the offering of the First-Priority Notes is not consummated at all or in
part, the Issuers will not be able to redeem the Prime Notes in full. See “Summary—The
Transactions.” Assuming this offering is consummated and the offering of the First-Priority
Notes is not consummated, Prime Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1,000
million will remain outstanding (assuming the repurchase or redemption of the Prime Notes in
an amount equal to $1,246 million of the proceeds of this offering). Each $1,000 decrease in the
principal amount of Unsecured Notes would result in an additional $1,000 aggregate principal
amount of Prime Notes that remains outstanding. The Prime Notes have a maturity date of
May 2, 2023 and bear interest at a 9.250%. For a description of the Prime Notes, see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Prime Notes.”

### USE OF PROCEEDS

The proceeds from the offering of the Unsecured Notes will be used to repurchase or
redeem $1,246 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes. The proceeds
from the offering of the First-Priority Notes will be used to (a) repurchase or redeem $1,000
million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Prime Notes and (b) repay $500.0 million of
outstanding term loans under our First Lien Credit Agreement. If the offerings of the Senior
Unsecured Notes and the First-Priority Notes are both successfully consummated, the Issuers
expect to repurchase or redeem all outstanding Prime Notes. We intend to pay all fees and
expenses associated with the Transactions with cash on hand and/or drawings under our
Revolving Credit Facility. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may
hold loans under the First Lien Term Facility and/or the Prime Notes, and, therefore, such initial
purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See “Plan of
Distribution”.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with
the Transactions, assuming they occurred on December 31, 2018 and based on estimated

-----

(1) As of December 31, 2018, $2,546 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes
were outstanding, $300 million of which were redeemed on February 1, 2019. Assumes that
the Issuers (a) will purchase no Prime Notes in the Tender Offer and (b) will redeem the
entire outstanding $2,246 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Prime
Notes on April 17, 2019, and pay all accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable
redemption premium on such Prime Notes to, but excluding, such date, in accordance with
the indenture governing the Prime Notes, which we expect will amount to approximately
$114.3 million. The Prime Notes have a maturity date of May 2, 2023 and bear interest at a
9.250%. As of the date hereof, accrued and unpaid interest on the Prime Notes was $71.0
million. Prior to May 15, 2019, the Issuers may redeem the Prime Notes at their option, in
whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

(2) Excludes amounts associated with debt discount, deferred financing costs, and fair value
adjustments. As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt discount, deferred
financing costs, and fair value adjustments approximated $268 million. This amount
decreased by approximately $2.6 million associated with the write-off of deferred financing
costs as part of the $300 million partial redemption of Prime Notes on February 1, 2019. We
expect that this amount will also decrease by (a) approximately $5 million, associated with
the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs as part of the $500 million
prepayment of the First Lien Term Loan Facility with the proceeds of the Notes offering, and
(b) approximately $20 million, associated with the write-off of the remaining deferred
financing costs upon the redemption of the Prime Notes (assuming the Full Redemption).
We also anticipate that this amount will increase by (a) approximately $24 million, due to
fees paid in connection with the issuance of the First-Priority Notes and (b) approximately
$19 million, due to fees paid in connection with the origination of the Unsecured Notes.

(3) As of December 31, 2018, stockholders’ equity was approximately $4,225 million. This
amount decreased by approximately $22 million due to the payment of a make whole
premium and the write-off of deferred financing costs as part of the $300 million partial
redemption of Prime Notes on February 1, 2019. We expect that this amount will decrease
by (a) approximately $5 million, associated with the write-off of debt discount and deferred
financing costs as part of the $500 million payment of the First Lien Term Loan Facility with
the proceeds of the Notes offering, (b) approximately $19 million, due to fees associated
with the Credit Agreement Amendment, and (c) approximately $134 million, due to the
payment of a make whole premium and the write-off of the remaining deferred financing
costs upon the redemption of the Prime Notes (assuming the Full Redemption).

(4) Represents outstanding shares of common stock (excluding unvested shares) of
756,590,285 at a closing price of (a) $6.01 per share as of December 31, 2018 and (b) $6.47
per share as of March 15, 2019.

(5) Represents the aggregate of (a) total debt plus (b) market capitalization.

### DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS

The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements does not
purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
underlying documents.

**First Lien Credit Agreement**

**_General_**

The Issuer is the borrower under that certain Seventh Amended and Restated First Lien
Credit Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended and restated on May 2, 2016, June 23,
2016, December 28, 2016, February 13, 2017, June 29, 2017, March 16, 2018 and December 3,
2018 (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”), consisting of (after giving effect to the Transactions):

   - a first lien term loan, in an aggregate principal amount of $3,424 million, maturing on
May 2, 2022 (the “First Lien Term Loan Facility”); and

   - a first lien revolving credit facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$400 million, maturing on March 16, 2023 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

As of December 31, 2018, the Issuer had borrowings of $3,924 million outstanding under the
First Lien Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
After giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer will have borrowings of $3,424 million
outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and borrowings of $100 million outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition: (i) under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer may request one or more
incremental term loan facilities or incremental revolving credit facilities and/or increase
commitments under the First Lien Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility in an
aggregate amount of up to the sum of a specified dollar amount plus any additional amounts so
long as on a pro forma basis (a) in the case of loans under such incremental facilities secured by
liens that rank pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer’s
consolidated net first lien senior secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 2.35 to 1.00
and (b) in the case of loans under such incremental facilities that rank junior to the liens
securing the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer’s consolidated total net secured leverage
ratio would be no greater than 3.60 to 1.00. The incurrence of incremental facilities under the
credit agreements governing the First Lien Credit Agreement is subject, in each case, to certain
conditions, the receipt of commitments from existing or additional lenders and the limitations
on incurring additional indebtedness applicable to the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including
under the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes, the ADT Notes, the Prime Notes (if any)
and the First-Priority Notes and each other agreement governing the Issuer’s indebtedness.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of
customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the material accuracy of
representations and warranties, and are available to fund any ordinary course working capital
requirements or for general corporate purposes.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to, at our option, either (a) adjusted LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for

33


-----

dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a 1.00% floor, or
(b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus
0.50%, (ii) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the
U.S. or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest per annum interest rate
published by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519)
(Selected Interest Rates) as the “bank prime loan” rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted
therein, any similar rate quoted or any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board
and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin of 2.75%
for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the Issuer is required to pay a commitment fee between 0.375% and 0.50%
(determined based on a net first lien leverage ratio) with respect to the unused commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Amortization and Prepayments_**

The First Lien Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in annual amounts
equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the balance payable at
maturity.

In addition, the First Lien Term Loan Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loan
borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with:

   - 50% (which percentage will be reduced if the consolidated net first lien senior secured
leverage ratio is less than or equal to certain thresholds) of the Issuer’s excess cash flow,
as defined under the First Lien Credit Agreement;

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales, other dispositions
of property or certain casualty events, in each case subject to certain exceptions and
provided that the Issuer may (a) reinvest within twelve months or (b) commit to reinvest
those proceeds and so reinvest such proceeds within 18 months in assets to be used in
its business, or certain other permitted investments; and

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt, other than proceeds from debt
permitted under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_Collateral and Guarantors_**

All obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by
Holdings on a limited-recourse basis and by each of the Issuer’s existing and future direct and
indirect material, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The
obligations are secured by a pledge of the Issuer’s capital stock and substantially all of the
Issuer’s assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the subsidiary
guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are not
subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist
of a first-priority lien with respect to the collateral.

**_Restrictive Covenants and Other Matters_**

The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Issuer, subject to a testing threshold, comply
as of the last day of each fiscal quarter with a specified maximum consolidated net first lien
senior secured leverage ratio. The testing threshold will be satisfied at any time at which the

34


-----

sum of outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions,
exceeds 30% of the outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at such fiscal
quarter end.

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants and
events of default. The negative covenants in the First Lien Credit Agreement include, among
other things, limitations (none of which are absolute) on our ability to incur additional debt or
issue certain preferred equity interests; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or
investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our
capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with our
affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or
restrict liens; change our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational
agreements in a manner materially adverse to lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_Credit Agreement Amendment_**

On March 15, 2019, the Issuer, as borrower, Prime Security Services Holdings, LLC, as
holdings (“Holdings”), the lenders party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as the administrative
agent thereunder entered into that certain Amendment Agreement No. 8 (the “Credit
Agreement Amendment”), which amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement. The
Credit Agreement Amendment amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other
things, (a) increase the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined therein) for the incurrence of
pari passu indebtedness to 3.20 to 1.00 (from 2.35 to 1.00), (b) provide for $300 million of
additional incremental pari passu debt capacity, (c) increase the borrowing capacity under the
Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $50 million, which replaced the revolving credit
commitments under the Mizuho Agreement (as defined below) and (d) make several other
changes to provide the Issuer with additional flexibility to de-lever its balance sheet and
opportunistically refinance existing indebtedness. The effectiveness of the Credit Agreement
Amendment is subject to market and other conditions, and the prepayment of $500.0 million
term loans outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement with the proceeds of this offering
and of the offering of the First-Priority Notes.

Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Issuer will
terminate that certain revolving credit agreement, dated February 15, 2019, by and among the
Issuer, as borrower, Holdings, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Mizuho Bank,
Ltd., as administrative agent (the “Mizuho Agreement”).

**Prime Notes**

On May 2, 2016, the Issuers issued $3,140 million in principal amount of 9.250% SecondPriority Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the “Prime Notes”). The Prime Notes mature on
May 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 9.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2016.

The Issuers may redeem the Prime Notes at their option, in whole or in part, at any time on
or after May 15, 2019, at certain redemption prices. In addition, prior to May 15, 2019, the
Issuers may redeem the Prime Notes at their option, in whole at any time or in part from time to
time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed,
plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time on or prior to May 15, 2019,
the Issuers may redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount

35


-----

of the Prime Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional Unsecured Notes)
in an aggregate amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to 109.250% of the principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, so long as at least 50% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Prime Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional
Unsecured Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption. In addition, the issuers
of the Prime Notes are required to make an offer to repurchase such notes in the event of
certain change in control transactions.

The Issuers partially redeemed (i) on February 21, 2018, $594 million of aggregate principal
amount of Prime Notes, at a price of $649 million, using proceeds from the initial public offering
and (ii) on February 1, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of Prime Notes, at a price
of $319 million, using cash on hand. As of the date hereof, the Prime Notes have an outstanding
balance of $2,246 million.

The Prime Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Issuer’s domestic
restricted subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement. The Prime Notes are also
secured by substantially all of the Issuer’s assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, in
each case by the same assets that secure the First Lien Credit Agreement including the capital
stock of the subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign
subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such
security interests consist of a second-priority lien with respect to the collateral.

The Prime Notes contain certain customary negative covenants and events of default. The
negative covenants limit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things,
incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, create liens on certain assets,
pay dividends or prepay junior debt or make other restricted payments, make certain loans,
acquisitions or investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, conduct asset sales, restrict
dividends from subsidiaries or restrict liens, or merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets.

**ADT Notes**

The ADT Security Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the issuer of
each of the following series of notes, which we refer to collectively as the “ADT Notes”:

due 2032, which mature on July 15, 2032.

Each series of ADT Notes is governed by an indenture between ADT and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee, and we refer to these indentures (as they may have been

36


-----

supplemented from time to time prior to the date hereof) collectively as the “ADT Notes
Indentures.” Under the ADT Notes Indentures, The ADT Security Corporation may redeem ADT
Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the
notes to be redeemed, plus an applicable make-whole premium for each series of the ADT
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The ADT Notes Indentures contain covenants that, among other things and subject to a
number of qualifications and exceptions, limit The ADT Security Corporation’s ability, and the
ability of its restricted subsidiaries, to (i) create liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and
lease-back transactions; and (iii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets. In the event of a change in control triggering event (as defined in
the applicable indenture), The ADT Security Corporation is required to make an offer to
repurchase such notes. The ADT Notes Indentures also provide for customary events of default
which, if triggered, would permit the acceleration of the debt thereunder.

In addition, the ADT Notes benefit from (i) guarantees by the Issuer and each of its domestic
restricted subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement (other than The ADT
Security Corporation, as the issuer of the ADT Notes), (ii) first-priority security interests, subject
to permitted liens, in substantially all of the Issuer’s existing and future assets and those of each
guarantor, which assets also secure the First Lien Credit Agreement on a first-priority basis and
the Prime Notes on a second-priority basis, and (iii) the same reporting covenant as the Prime
Notes.

### DESCRIPTION OF UNSECURED NOTES

**General**

Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the

“Company”), and Prime Finance Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Co-Issuer,” together with the
Company, the “Issuers” and each, an “Issuer”), will issue % Senior Notes due 2027 (the

“unsecured notes”) under an indenture (the “indenture”), to be entered into by and among the
Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as Trustee. In this description, (i) “we,” “us” and “our” mean the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the Co-Issuer, and (ii) the term “Issuers” refers only to the Company and
the Co-Issuer, but not to any of their Subsidiaries. Copies of the indenture may be obtained from
the Issuers upon request.

The following summary of certain provisions of the indenture and the unsecured notes does
not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all
the provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein. Capitalized
terms used in this “Description of Unsecured Notes” section and not otherwise defined have the
meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuers will issue unsecured notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of
$1,250.0 million. Following the Issue Date, the Issuers may issue additional unsecured notes
from time to time. Any offering of additional unsecured notes is subject to the covenants
described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain
Covenants—Liens.” The unsecured notes and any additional unsecured notes subsequently
issued under the indenture may, at our election, be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase; provided that if the additional unsecured notes are not fungible with the
unsecured notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the additional unsecured notes will have
a separate CUSIP number, if applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes
of the indenture and this “Description of Unsecured Notes,” references to the unsecured notes
include any additional unsecured notes actually issued.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the unsecured notes will be payable, and the
unsecured notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency designated by the
Issuers (which initially shall be the designated office or agency of the Trustee).

The unsecured notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in
minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;
_provided that unsecured notes may be issued in denominations of less than $2,000 solely to_
accommodate book-entry positions that have been created by a DTC participant in
denominations of less than $2,000. No service charge will be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of unsecured notes, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

**Terms of the Unsecured Notes**

The unsecured notes will be senior obligations of the Issuers and will mature on,
2027. Each note will bear interest at a rate of % per annum from the Issue Date or from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semiannually to
holders of record at the close of business on or immediately preceding the
interest payment date on and of each year, commencing, 2019.

38


-----

**Optional Redemption**

On or after, 2022, the Issuers may redeem the unsecured notes at their option, in
whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice mailed by the Issuers by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, or
delivered electronically if held by DTC, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period
commencing on of the years set forth below:

In addition, prior to, 2022, the Issuers may redeem the unsecured notes at their
option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice mailed by the Issuers by first-class mail to each holder’s registered
address, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the unsecured notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2022,
the Issuers may redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the unsecured notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional unsecured
notes) in an amount not to exceed the amount of net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings (1) by the Company or (2) by any direct or indirect parent of the Company to the
extent the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of the
Company or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, at a
redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of %, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the unsecured notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional unsecured
notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption; provided, further, that such
redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is
consummated upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed by the Issuers to
each holder of unsecured notes being redeemed, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, and
otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture.

Notice of any redemption upon any corporate transaction or other event (including any
Equity Offering, Incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction) may be
given prior to the completion thereof. In addition, any redemption described above or notice
thereof may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a corporate transaction or other event. If any
redemption is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied
(or waived by the Issuers in the Issuers’ discretion), and/or such redemption may not occur and

39


-----

such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in the Issuers’ discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed, and/or that such notice may be rescinded at any time by the
Issuers if the Issuers determine in their discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be
satisfied (or waived). In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

**Selection**

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of unsecured notes for redemption will be
made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities
exchange, if any, on which the unsecured notes are listed (and the Issuers shall notify the
Trustee of any such listing), or if the unsecured notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the
extent practicable or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate (and, in such manner that complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable);
provided that no unsecured notes of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Notices of
redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or with respect to global notes, to the extent
permitted or required by applicable DTC procedures or regulations, sent electronically) at least
30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of unsecured notes to
be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the unsecured notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture. If any note
is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue
on unsecured notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuers have
deposited with the paying agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid
interest (if any) on, the unsecured notes to be redeemed.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund
payments with respect to the unsecured notes. However, under certain circumstances, the
Issuers may be required to offer to purchase unsecured notes as described under the captions
“—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” We may at any time, and from
time to time, purchase unsecured notes in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise.

**Ranking**

The indebtedness evidenced by the unsecured notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees,
respectively, will be senior Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors,
respectively, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior
Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors and will be senior in right of
payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary
Guarantors.

As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the
Issuers and their Subsidiaries would have had:

(1) $8,774 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting Secured Indebtedness,
consisting of (i) $3,524 million outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement

40


-----

(including $100 million drawn under the revolving facility of the First Lien Credit
Agreement), (ii) $3,750 million outstanding under the ADT Notes and (iii)
$1,500.0 million outstanding under the First-Priority Notes;

(2) $1,250 million of senior unsecured Indebtedness under the unsecured notes; and

(3) no Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not Subsidiary Guarantors.

In addition, as of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Issuers would have had $300 million of unutilized capacity (without giving
effect to letters of credit) under the revolving facility of the First Lien Credit Agreement, which
would constitute First Priority Lien Obligations.

Although the indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of
Disqualified Stock by the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries, and the issuance of Preferred
Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, such
limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. The Issuers and
their Restricted Subsidiaries are able to Incur additional amounts of Indebtedness. Under certain
circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to certain
limitations, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “—Certain Covenants —Liens.”

Unless a Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary,
including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary,
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of the Issuers, including holders of the unsecured notes. The holders of the
unsecured notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to holders of indebtedness and
other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary
of the Issuers that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor. As of the Issue Date, our only Subsidiaries that
are not Subsidiary Guarantors will be (i) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (ii) immaterial
subsidiaries, (iii) Foreign Subsidiaries or (iv) Subsidiaries of the foregoing, all of which, as of
December 31, 2018, had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured Notes—The Unsecured
Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our current and future non-guarantor
subsidiaries.”

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

Each of the Issuers’ direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are
Domestic Subsidiaries (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) and that are borrowers or
guarantors under the First Priority Lien Obligations will jointly and severally irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantee on a senior unsecured basis the performance and punctual payment
when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the
Issuers under the indenture and the unsecured notes, whether for payment of principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the unsecured notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all
such obligations guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantors being herein called the

“Guaranteed Obligations”). Such Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the
amount stated above, any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses)
incurred by the Trustee in enforcing any rights under the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the

41


-----

Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law
relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured
Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the
Unsecured Notes and guarantees and require holders of Unsecured Notes to return payments
received.” After the Issue Date, the Issuers will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary
that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) that Incurs or guarantees
certain Indebtedness of an Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to execute and deliver to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
guarantee payment of the unsecured notes on the same senior unsecured basis. See “—Certain
Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment
in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Subsidiary
Guarantor and its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

Each Subsidiary’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically released upon any of the
following:

(1) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock
(including any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer following which the
applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary), of the applicable
Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer is made in a
manner not in violation of the indenture;

(2) (i) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii) the
occurrence of any other event following which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer
a Restricted Subsidiary in a manner not in violation of the indenture;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the First Lien
Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to
guarantee the unsecured notes;

(4) the release or discharge by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Indebtedness which
resulted in the obligation to guarantee the unsecured notes;

(5) the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Defeasance” or if the Issuers’ obligations under the indenture are
discharged in accordance with the terms of the indenture;

(6) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge
or security interest securing Secured Indebtedness or other exercise of remedies in
respect thereof;

(7) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;

(8) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with
and into an Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor or upon the liquidation or

42


-----

dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, in a manner not in violation of
the indenture; and

(9) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the
Issuers to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s unsecured notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent
the Issuers have previously or concurrently elected to redeem unsecured notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption.”

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control, the terms of any Bank Indebtedness
restrict or prohibit the repurchase of unsecured notes pursuant to this covenant, then within 30
days following any Change of Control, the Issuers shall:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness or, if doing so will allow the purchase of unsecured
notes, offer to repay in full all Bank Indebtedness and repay the Bank Indebtedness of
each lender and/or noteholder who has accepted such offer; or

(2) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing the Bank Indebtedness to
permit the repurchase of the unsecured notes as provided for in the immediately
following paragraphs.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured Notes—We may
not be able to repurchase the Unsecured Notes upon a change of control.”

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have
exercised their right to redeem the unsecured notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers shall mail to each holder’s registered
address, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice (a “Change
of Control Offer”) stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the
Issuers to repurchase such holder’s unsecured notes at a repurchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change
of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically), except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as
described below (in which case the expected repurchase date will be stated and may be
based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that is expected to result in the
Change of Control and which may be tolled until the closing of such transaction); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder
must follow in order to have its unsecured notes purchased.

43


-----

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned
upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at
the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

In addition, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a
Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all unsecured notes properly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding unsecured
notes validly tender and do not withdraw such unsecured notes in a Change of Control Offer
and the Issuers, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as
described above, purchase all of the unsecured notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all unsecured notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Unsecured notes repurchased by the Issuers pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will
have the status of notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option
of the Issuers. Unsecured notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding
paragraphs will have the status of unsecured notes issued and outstanding.

The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase
of unsecured notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuers will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their
obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof.

This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations among the Issuers
and the initial purchasers. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction
involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in
the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, securitizations or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that
could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the
Issuers’ capital structure or credit rating.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a
default under the Credit Agreement. Future Bank Indebtedness of the Issuers may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Bank
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the unsecured notes upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself
does not cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Issuers. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuers’ then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Unsecured Notes—
We may not be able to repurchase the Unsecured Notes upon a change of control.”

44


-----

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer
of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
under New York law, which governs the indenture, there is no precise established definition of
the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of unsecured notes to
require the Issuers to repurchase such unsecured notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of
less than all of the assets of the Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make a Change of
Control Offer may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the unsecured notes.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the indenture.
If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the unsecured notes have Investment Grade Ratings
from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the
indenture then, beginning on such date (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the
covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Unsecured
Notes” section of this offering memorandum will not be applicable to the unsecured notes
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets”; and

(7) “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

If and while the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants, the unsecured notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the
event that the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their
Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the unsecured notes below an
Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again
be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture with respect to future events. The
period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in
this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Issuers will provide the Trustee with written
notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date within five Business Days of the
occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor or provide notice to the holders
of the unsecured notes of any such Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred or issued

45


-----

pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” below or one of the clauses set forth in the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock” below (to the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock would be permitted to be Incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after
giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding
on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
would not be so permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to the first or second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,” such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second
paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available
to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made
as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in
effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly,
Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available
to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have
occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuers or its Restricted
Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, the Issuers
must comply with the terms of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future
Subsidiary Guarantors.”

(a) through (aa) above (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma effect to the

paragraph above (or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Indebtedness
that may be Incurred, divided, classified or reclassified pursuant to any such clause or
paragraph (or any portion thereof) at such time; and

(3) in connection with the Incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of (x) revolving loan
Indebtedness under this covenant or (y) any commitment relating to the Incurrence or
issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under this covenant and
the granting of any Lien to secure such Indebtedness, the Issuers or applicable
Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Incurrence or issuance and the granting of
any Lien therefor as having occurred on the date of first Incurrence of such revolving
loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related
subsequent actual Incurrence or issuance and granting of such Lien therefor will be
deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been Incurred or issued and
granted on such Deemed Date, including without limitation for purposes of calculating
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable), the
Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio and EBITDA (and all such calculations on and after the Deemed Date
until the termination or funding of such commitment shall be made on a pro forma
basis giving effect to the deemed Incurrence or issuance, the granting of any Lien
therefor and related transactions in connection therewith).

Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in
the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable,
amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the accretion of original
issue discount or deferred financing costs or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies
or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness described in clause (3) of the
definition of “Indebtedness” will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or
obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in
the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the
determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the
Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in
compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on
the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first

53


-----

committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of
revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness does
not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of
Indebtedness that the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this
covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness,
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from
the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in
effect on the date of the refinancing.

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; or (B) dividends or
distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or
distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of Equity Interests issued by

Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution
in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of Equity Interests);

(2) purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Company or
any direct or indirect parent of the Company;

(3) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire

(A) Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of
such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement and
(B) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (g) and (i) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

Restricted Payments made by the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries after
May 2, 2016 (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (6)(c), (8) and
(13)(b) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted
Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the amount
equal to the Cumulative Credit outstanding at such time.

“Cumulative Credit” means the sum of (without duplication):

(1) an amount, not less than zero in the aggregate, equal to 50% of Consolidated Net

(d) such Indebtedness has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time Incurred
which is not less than the shorter of (x) the remaining Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of the Subordinated Indebtedness being so redeemed, repurchased,

any write-downs or write-offs thereof or subsequent changes in value); provided,
however, that if any Investment pursuant to this clause (7) is made in any Person that is
not an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary at the date of the making of such Investment
and such Person becomes an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after such date, such
Investment shall thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant to clause (1) of the
definition of Permitted Investments and shall cease to have been made pursuant to this
clause (7) for so long as such Person continues to be an Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(8) (a) Restricted Payments (or a Restricted Payment to any direct or indirect parent of the

applicable) attributable to its direct or indirect ownership of the Issuers and their

Subsidiaries with respect to such taxable period (assuming that each owner is
subject to tax at the highest combined marginal federal, state, and/or local income
tax rate applicable to any owner for such taxable period and taking into account the
deductibility of state and local income taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(and any limitations thereon), the alternative minimum tax, any cumulative net
taxable loss of the Company for prior taxable periods ending after the Issue Date to
the extent such loss is of a character that would allow such loss to be available to

already been utilized) and the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain
or ordinary or exempt) of the applicable income);

Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased,
redeemed or acquired for value;

appraisal rights pursuant to applicable law or as a result of the settlement of any
stockholder claims or action (whether actual, contingent or potential), pursuant to or in
connection with a consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, that complies with the covenant described under “Merger, Amalgamation,
Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; provided that as a result of
such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of assets, the Issuers shall have
made a Change of Control Offer (if required by the indenture) and that all unsecured
notes tendered by holders in connection with such Change of Control Offer have been
repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(19) any Restricted Payment made in connection with the Transactions and the payment of
fees and expenses Incurred in connection with the Transactions or owed by either

Payment, the Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal
quarters for which financial statements have been delivered to the Trustee immediately
preceding such Restricted Payment is not greater than 2.95 to 1.00 on a pro forma
basis.

provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment
permitted under clauses (6)(b), (7), (10), (11), (13)(b) and (20), no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; provided, further, that
any Restricted Payments made with property other than cash shall be calculated using the Fair
Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Issuers) of such property.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Restricted Payment or
Permitted Investment need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted
Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any portion thereof)
described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or
Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories
of permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any
portion thereof) described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof, the Issuers may, in
their sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such
permitted Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion
thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of division,
classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such
Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) in
one of the categories of permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted
Investments (or any portion thereof) described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof. In
the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any

61


-----

portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified under clause (20) above, the first proviso of
clause (19) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” or clause (27) of the definition of
“Permitted Investments” (such clauses, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the
amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that may be made pursuant to the
Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially
concurrent Incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any other Restricted Payment (or any portion
thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under
any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an Incurrence Clause.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to a
Restricted Payment or Investment, the Issuers or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may
designate such Restricted Payment or Investment as having occurred on the date of the
commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election
Date”) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment or Investment and all related
transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuers or any
of their Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on the
relevant Election Date in compliance with the indenture, and any related subsequent actual
making of such Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been
made on such Election Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating any ratio,
compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and EBITDA and for
purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such
calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission,
retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be
made on a pro forma basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection
therewith).

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuers will be Restricted Subsidiaries.
The Issuers will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary
except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any
Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated on
such date of designation will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as
set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be
permitted if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted
at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become
effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to either Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary (1) on its Capital Stock; or (2) with respect to any other interest or
participation in, or measured by, its profits; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to either
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make loans or advances to either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to either Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

62


-----

except in each case for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) (i) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date,
(ii) contractual encumbrances or restrictions pursuant to the Credit Agreement and
the other Credit Agreement Documents, (iii) contractual encumbrances or
restrictions pursuant to the indentures governing the ADT Notes and the FirstPriority Notes, and (iv) in each case, any similar contractual encumbrances or
restrictions or any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of such agreements or
instruments;

(2) the indenture, the unsecured notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(4) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by an Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary which was in existence at the time of such acquisition (but
not created in contemplation thereof or to provide all or any portion of the funds or
credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition), which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person,
other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person
and its Subsidiaries, so acquired;

(5) contracts or agreements for the sale of assets, including any restriction with respect
to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the
sale or disposition of the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the
covenants described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Liens” that limit the
right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(7) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by suppliers,
customers or landlords under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice or industry norm or arising in connection
with any Permitted Liens;

(8) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or
industry norm;

(9) purchase money obligations for property acquired and Capitalized Lease
Obligations in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature
discussed in clause (c) above on the property so acquired;

(10) customary provisions contained in leases, licenses and other similar agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or
industry norm;

(11) in the case of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant, any encumbrance or
restriction that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or
transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar
contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license (including without
limitation, licenses of intellectual property) or other contracts;

(12) any encumbrances or restrictions contained in any Permitted Securitization
Document with respect to any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary;

63


-----

(13) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (a) of either Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary or
(b) of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign
Subsidiary so long as such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
agreement or instrument will not materially adversely affect the Issuers’ ability to
make anticipated principal or interest payments on the unsecured notes (as
determined in good faith by the Issuers), provided that in the case of each of
clauses (a) and (b), such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date by the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(14) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments” and any Permitted Investment; or

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above
imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments
or obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (14) above; provided that such
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the
Issuers, not materially more restrictive with respect to such dividend and other
payment restrictions than those contained in the dividend or other payment
restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred
Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating
distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to
make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination of loans or advances made to an
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by an Issuer or any such
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales_**

(a) The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) an Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such
Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the
Issuers) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of, and (y) at least 75% of the
consideration for such Asset Sale received by such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(1) any liabilities (as shown on an Issuer’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet or in the unsecured notes thereto) of an Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
unsecured notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee
of any such assets or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with
the transaction with such transferee,

(2) any unsecured notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted
by such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the
receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash received),

-----

(3) Indebtedness of any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer an Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the other
Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of
payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the Asset Sale,

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons
who are not an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and

(5) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by any Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as
determined in good faith by the Issuers), taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $190.0 million and 6.25% of the Pro Forma
EBITDA of the Issuers for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements have been delivered to the Trustee immediately preceding the
receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration and after giving pro forma
effect thereto as if such event occurred at the beginning of such four fiscal quarters
(with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to any write-downs
or write-offs thereof or subsequent changes in value),

shall in each case be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

(b) Within 365 days after any Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net
Proceeds of any Asset Sale, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply the
Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to repay (i) Indebtedness constituting Bank Indebtedness and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien permitted under the indenture (and, if the
Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto), (ii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, (iii) Notes Obligations or (iv) other Pari Passu
Indebtedness (provided that if an Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall so
reduce Obligations under other Pari Passu Indebtedness under this clause (iv)
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include Indebtedness described in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), even if such Indebtedness may also constitute Pari Passu
Indebtedness), the Issuers will equally and ratably reduce Notes Obligations either,
as the Issuers shall elect in their sole discretion, as provided under “Optional
Redemption,” through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are at
or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, in the event that the unsecured
notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted
value thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase a pro rata principal
amount of unsecured notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof (or, in the event that the unsecured notes were issued with
significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any); or

(2) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such
investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such
acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers
or in an increase in the percentage ownership by the Issuers (or a Restricted
Subsidiary) in such Restricted Subsidiary), assets, or property or capital

-----

expenditures, in each case (a) used or useful in a Similar Business or (b) that
replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or in each
case to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on
which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Proceeds was contractually committed.

(c) In the case of clause (b)(2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the 18-month
anniversary of the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds; provided that in the event
such binding commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason after the 365[th]
day after the receipt of such Net Proceeds but before such Net Proceeds are so applied,
then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless such Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment (a “Second

Commitment”) within six months of such cancellation or termination of the prior
binding commitment; provided, further, that such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
may only enter into a Second Commitment under the foregoing provision one time
with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such Second Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied or are not
applied within 180 days of such Second Commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall
constitute Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, such Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or
otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net
Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied as provided and within the time period set
forth in paragraph (b) of this covenant (it being understood that any portion of such Net
Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase unsecured notes, as described in clause (b)(1)
above, shall be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) will be
deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
$190.0 million, the Issuers shall make an offer to all holders of unsecured notes (and, at the
option of the Issuers, to holders of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to
purchase the maximum principal amount of unsecured notes (and such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness), that is at least $2,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event the unsecured notes or such other Pari
Passu Indebtedness were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted
value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such other Pari
Passu Indebtedness) to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the indenture. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer
with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $190.0 million by mailing, or delivering electronically if
held by DTC, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the indenture, with a copy to the
Trustee. The Issuers may, at their option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any
Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net
Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above)
or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $190.0 million or less (it being understood that such Net
Proceeds used to make an Asset Sale Offer shall satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect
to Net Proceeds whether or not such offer is accepted). To the extent that the aggregate amount
of unsecured notes (and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to an Asset
Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds
for any purpose that is not prohibited by the indenture and shall not be required to use them for
any other purpose. If the aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes (and such other Pari

66


-----

Passu Indebtedness) surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Trustee, upon receipt of notice from the Issuers of the aggregate principal amount to be
selected, shall select the unsecured notes to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero
(regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion).

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the unsecured notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall
not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the indenture by virtue thereof.

If more unsecured notes (and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness) are tendered pursuant to
an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such unsecured notes
for purchase will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal
national securities exchange, if any, on which such unsecured notes are listed (and the Issuers
shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such unsecured notes are not so listed, on a pro
rata basis to the extent practicable, by lot or by such other method as the Issuers deem
appropriate (and in such manner as complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable);
provided that no unsecured notes of $2,000 or less shall be purchased in part. Selection of such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be made pursuant to the terms of such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by the Issuers by first class mail, postage
prepaid, or delivered electronically if held at DTC, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before
the purchase date to each holder of unsecured notes at such holder’s registered address, with a
copy to the Trustee. If any note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that
relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to
be purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuers
(each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess
of $42.0 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, when taken
as a whole, to the relevant Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have
been obtained in a comparable transaction by such Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary with
an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $90.0 million, the Issuers deliver to the
Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of
the Company, approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above.

by the Issuers, or any transaction contemplated thereby;

(7) the existence of, or the performance by an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its
obligations under the terms of, any stockholders, limited liability company, limited
partnership or other agreement (including any registration rights agreement or
purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party as of the Issue Date, and any
transaction, agreement or arrangement described in this offering memorandum and, in
each case, any amendment thereto or similar transactions, agreements or

arrangements which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence
of, or the performance by an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations
under, any future amendment to any such existing transaction, agreement or
arrangement or under any similar transaction, agreement or arrangement entered into
after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the
terms of any such existing transaction, agreement or arrangement together with all
amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction, agreement or arrangement
are not otherwise materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the unsecured
notes than the original transaction, agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue

Issuers;

(8) the execution of the Transactions, and the payment of all fees, expenses, bonuses and

proposed or outstanding issue amount of such class of securities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing covenant, the Sponsors and any portfolio company that is
an Affiliate of the Sponsors shall not be considered an Affiliate of an Issuer or its Subsidiaries
with respect to any transaction, so long as such transaction is in the ordinary course of
business.

**_Liens_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of their
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien (except
Permitted Liens) on any asset or property of any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary securing
Indebtedness of the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary unless the unsecured notes are equally
and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of obligations subordinated in right
of payment to the unsecured notes) the obligations so secured until such time as such
obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.

Any Lien that is granted to secure the unsecured notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee under
the preceding paragraph shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at
the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the unsecured
notes or such Subsidiary Guarantee.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) need not be permitted solely by reference to one category
of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any
portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Issuers may, in their sole discretion, divide, classify or
reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later time), such Lien
securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with

70


-----

this covenant and at the time of Incurrence, division, classification or reclassification will be
entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured
by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) will be treated as being Incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or
any portion thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof without giving pro forma effect to
such item (or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or any portion
thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to any revolving loan Indebtedness or
commitment relating to the Incurrence of Indebtedness that is designated to be Incurred on any
date pursuant to clause (3) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” any Lien
that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by the Issuers or any
Restricted Subsidiary to be Incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent
actual Incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be
Incurred on such prior date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien”
until such time as the related Indebtedness is no longer deemed outstanding pursuant to clause
(3) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such
Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be
permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of
any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue
discount or deferred financing costs, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms or in the form of common stock of an Issuer, the payment of
dividends on Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock of the same
class, accretion of original issue discount or deferred financing costs or liquidation preference
and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness
described in clause (3) of the definition of “Indebtedness.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The indenture will provide that so long as any unsecured notes are outstanding, the Issuers
will deliver to the Trustee and, upon request, to beneficial owners a copy of all of the
information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
non-accelerated filers, annual reports of the Reporting Entity (as defined below) for
such fiscal year containing the information that would have been required to be
contained in an annual report on Form 10-K (or any successor or comparable form) if
the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to
the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
non-accelerated filers, quarterly reports of the Reporting Entity for such fiscal quarter
containing the information that would have been required to be contained in a quarterly
report on Form 10-Q (or any successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had
been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to the extent permitted to be
excluded by the SEC; and

71


-----

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
filing current reports on Form 8-K, current reports of the Reporting Entity containing
substantially all of the information that would be required to be filed in a Current
Report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on the Issue Date pursuant to Sections 1, 2
and 4, Items 5.01, 5.02 (a), (b) and (c) and Item 9.01(a) and (b) (only to the extent
relating to any of the foregoing) of Form 8-K if the Reporting Entity had been a
reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that no such current
reports (or Items thereof or all or a portion of the financial statements that would have
otherwise been required thereby) will be required to be delivered (or included) if the
Issuers determine in its good faith judgment that such event (or information) is not
material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects
of the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

If at any time the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company has made a
good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an initial
public offering of such Person’s Capital Stock, the Issuers will not be required to disclose any
information or take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Issuers, would violate the
securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on such
initial public offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) none of the Issuers nor any Reporting Entity will be
required to deliver any information, certificates or reports that would otherwise be required by
(i) Section 302 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of
Regulation S-K, or (ii) Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any
non-generally accepted accounting principles financial measures contained therein, (b) such
reports will not be required to contain financial information required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10,
Rule 3-16 or Article 11 of Regulation S-X or include any exhibits or certifications required by
Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K (or any such successor or comparable forms) or related rules
under Regulation S-K, (c) such reports shall be subject to exceptions, exclusions and other
differences consistent with the presentation of financial and other information in this offering
memorandum and shall not be required to present compensation or beneficial ownership
information and (d) trade secrets and other proprietary information may be excluded from any
disclosures.

The financial statements, information and other documents required to be provided as
described above, may be those of (i) the Company or (ii) any direct or indirect parent of the
Company (any such entity described in clause (i) or (ii), a “Reporting Entity”), so long as in the
case of (ii) such direct or indirect parent of the Company will not conduct, transact or otherwise
engage, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage, in any business or operations
other than its direct or indirect ownership of all of the Equity Interests in, and its management of
the Company; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such direct or
indirect parent of the Company, the same is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description
of the quantitative differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand,
and the information relating to the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone
basis, on the other hand.

In addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuers will make available to
the holders, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the
unsecured notes and securities analysts the information required to be provided pursuant to
clauses (1), (2) or (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, by posting such information to the
website of the Company (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Company) or on
IntraLinks or any comparable online data system or website.

72


-----

The Issuers have agreed that, for so long as any unsecured notes remain outstanding
during any period when they are not or any Reporting Entity is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish the SEC with certain information
pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, they will deliver to the holders of the unsecured
notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. The Issuers will also hold quarterly
conference calls, beginning with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date, for all
holders of the unsecured notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial
purchaser of the unsecured notes and securities analysts to discuss such financial information
no later than ten business days after the distribution of such information required by clauses
(1) or (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, and prior to the date of each such conference
call, the Issuers will announce the time and date of such conference call and either include all
information necessary to access the call in such announcement or inform holders of unsecured
notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the
unsecured notes and securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including,
without limitation, the applicable password or other login information (if applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers will be deemed to have delivered such reports
and information referred to above to the holders, prospective investors, market makers,
securities analysts and the Trustee for all purposes of the indenture if an Issuer or a Reporting
Entity has filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system (or any successor
system) and such reports are publicly available. In addition, the requirements of this covenant
shall be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would be required to be provided to the
holders on the Company’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the
Company).

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Subsidiary and that guarantees or becomes a borrower under
the Credit Agreement or that guarantees any other Indebtedness of either Issuer or any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant
to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the unsecured notes.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Subsidiary
Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be released in accordance with the provisions of the
indenture described under “—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The indenture will provide that the Company may not, directly or indirectly, consolidate,
amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up or convert into, consummate a Delaware LLC
Division (whether or not the Company is the surviving Person or successor, as applicable) or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division, merger, winding up or
conversion (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,

73


-----

lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof (the Company or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Company”); provided that in the event that the Successor Company is not a
corporation, a co-obligor of the unsecured notes is a corporation;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Company under the indenture pursuant to supplemental indentures
or other applicable documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (and treating any
Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction),
either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
sentence of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be no less than such ratio immediately
prior to such transaction;

(5) if the Company is not the Successor Company, each Subsidiary Guarantor, unless it is
the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by supplemental
indenture confirmed that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s
obligations under the indenture and the unsecured notes; and

(6) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or
transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the indenture.

The Successor Company (if other than the Company) will succeed to, and be substituted for,
the Company under the indenture and the unsecured notes, and in such event the Company will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture and the
unsecured notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) the Company may merge, consolidate
or amalgamate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing the Company in another state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any
territory of the United States (collectively, a “Permitted Jurisdiction”) or may convert into a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby. This “—Merger,
Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” will not apply to a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to
Permitted Securitization Financings.

74


-----

The indenture will further provide that, subject to certain provisions in the indenture
governing release of the Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantee and other release provisions upon
the sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is the Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor,
none of the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Company will not permit the
Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or
wind up into, consummate a Delaware LLC Division (whether or not the Co-Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or successor, as applicable), or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets
in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) either (a) the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving
Person or successor, as applicable, or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division or merger (if other than the
Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation (in the case
of the Co-Issuer) or a company, corporation, partnership or limited liability company or
similar entity organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (the Co-Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor”), and the Successor (if other than the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor under the indenture and the unsecured notes or the Subsidiary Guarantee,
as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other applicable documents or
instruments, or (b) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger
is not in violation of the covenant described above under the caption “—Asset Sales”;
and

(2) the Successor (if other than the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall have
delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the indenture.

Subject to certain provisions described in the indenture, the Successor (if other than the
Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Co-Issuer or
such Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture and the unsecured notes or the Subsidiary
Guarantee, as applicable, and the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be
released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture and the unsecured notes or its
Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Co-Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated
solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Subsidiary Guarantor in a
Permitted Jurisdiction or (other than the Co-Issuer) may convert into a limited liability company,
corporation, partnership or similar entity organized or existing under the laws of any Permitted
Jurisdiction so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor is not increased thereby and (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge, amalgamate or
consolidate with an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate,
amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets to an
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor.

**Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will be defined in the indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any note when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuers for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or
the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes
then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of their obligations,
covenants or agreements contained in the provisions of the indenture described in
“Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”;

(4) the failure by any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice
given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the unsecured notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with its
other obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses
(1), (2) and (3) above) contained in the unsecured notes or the indenture;

(5) the failure by any Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay
any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owing to an Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary or any Permitted Securitization Financing) within any applicable
grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the
holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such
Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $125.0 million or its foreign currency
equivalent (the “cross-acceleration provision”);

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of an Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of
Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any
Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay
final judgments aggregating in excess of $125.0 million or its foreign currency
equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable insurance policies
issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a
period of 60 days (the “judgment default provision”); or

(8) the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that
together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) with respect to the unsecured notes
ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or an
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary (or any
group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) denies or
disaffirms its obligations under the indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect
to the unsecured notes (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) and such Default
continues for 10 days.

Each of the foregoing will constitute an Event of Default whatever the reason for any such
Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or

76


-----

pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clauses (3) or (4) will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee notifies the Issuers or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
outstanding unsecured notes notify the Issuers, with a copy to the Trustee, of the default and
the Issuers do not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3) or (4) hereof after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by
notice to the Issuers or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding
unsecured notes by notice to the Issuers, with a copy to the Trustee, may declare the principal
of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the unsecured notes to be due and
payable; provided, however, that so long as any Bank Indebtedness remains outstanding, no
such acceleration shall be effective until the earlier of (1) five Business Days after the giving of
written notice to the Issuers and the Representative under the Credit Agreement and (2) the day
on which any Bank Indebtedness is accelerated. Upon such a declaration, such principal and
interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of an Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on all the unsecured notes will become immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances,
the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding unsecured notes may rescind any
such acceleration with respect to the unsecured notes and its consequences.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such
Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment
default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the
Trustee or the holders of the unsecured notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose
the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or
guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders
thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving
rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the
unsecured notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of
any such events.

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders
unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
indenture or the unsecured notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing,

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding unsecured
notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy,

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against
any loss, liability or expense,

77


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity, and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding unsecured notes have
not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding
unsecured notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action
under the indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to
a Trust Officer or the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder of the unsecured notes, or
deliver electronically if held by DTC, notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it
occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by
the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or
interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust
Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In
addition, the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, annually, a certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Issuers are also required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action
the Issuers are taking or propose to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture, the unsecured notes and the Subsidiary
Guarantees may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount
of the unsecured notes then outstanding and any past default or compliance with any
provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the unsecured notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an
outstanding note affected, no amendment may:

(1) reduce the amount of unsecured notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any note;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the dates on
which any such premium is payable upon redemption as described under “—Optional
Redemption” above;

(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in such note;

(6) expressly subordinate the unsecured notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee to any other
Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor;

(7) impair the contractual right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on such holder’s note on or after the due dates therefor or to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s
note; or

78


-----

(8) make any change in the amendment provisions or in the waiver provisions which
require each holder’s consent.

Without the consent of any holder, the Issuers and the Trustee may amend the indenture,
the unsecured notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission,
mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for the assumption by a Successor Company
(with respect to an Issuer) of the obligations of an Issuer under the indenture and the unsecured
notes; (3) to provide for the assumption by a Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (with respect to
any Subsidiary Guarantor), as the case may be, of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor
under the indenture, the unsecured notes and its Subsidiary Guarantee; (4) to provide for
uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes (provided that the
uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or
in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code);
(5) to add a Subsidiary Guarantee or collateral with respect to the unsecured notes; (6) to secure
the unsecured notes and/or the related Subsidiary Guarantees and to add provisions regarding
the release of collateral; (7) to add to the covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders
or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuers; (8) to make any change that
would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders or that does not adversely affect
the rights of any holder in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuers); (9)
to conform the text of the indenture, Subsidiary Guarantees or the unsecured notes to any
provision of this “Description of Unsecured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of Unsecured Notes” was intended by the Issuers to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the indenture, Subsidiary Guarantees or the unsecured notes, as applicable, as
stated in an Officer’s Certificate; (10) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection
with the qualification of the indenture under the TIA (if the Issuers elect to qualify the indenture
under the TIA); (11) to effect any provision of the indenture; (12) to make certain changes to the
indenture to provide for the issuance of additional unsecured notes; or (13) to add provisions to
the indenture and a new form of note to permit the issuance by the Issuers or a Subsidiary
thereof of escrow notes under the indenture, which may have different terms than other notes
issued under the indenture so long as the proceeds of such notes remain in escrow (including,
but not limited to, collateral, different or no guarantees and redemption provisions).

The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Managers and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator or holder of any Equity Interests in
either Issuer or any direct or indirect parent companies, as such, will have any liability for any
obligations of either Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the unsecured notes, the
indenture or the Subsidiary Guarantees, as applicable, or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of unsecured notes by accepting
a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the unsecured notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange unsecured notes in accordance with the indenture.
Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among
other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuers may

79


-----

require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the indenture. The Issuers
are not required to transfer or exchange any unsecured notes selected for redemption or to
transfer or exchange any unsecured notes for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of
unsecured notes to be redeemed or between a record date and the relevant payment date. The
unsecured notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a note will be
treated as the owner of such note for all purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights, indemnities and immunities of the Trustee and rights of registration or transfer
or exchange of unsecured notes, as expressly provided for in the indenture) as to all
outstanding unsecured notes when:

(1) either (a) all the unsecured notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost,
stolen or destroyed notes which have been replaced or paid and unsecured notes for
whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held
in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged from such
trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the unsecured
notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year or (iii) if
redeemable at the option of the Issuers, are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers, and the Issuers have
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the unsecured notes not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the unsecured notes to the date of deposit (in the case of unsecured
notes that have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as
applicable, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuers directing the Trustee
to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may
be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of
the redemption only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of
the redemption;

(2) the Issuers and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors have paid all other sums payable under
the indenture; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all of its obligations under the unsecured notes and

the indenture with respect to the holders of the unsecured notes (“legal defeasance”), except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register
the transfer or exchange of the unsecured notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
unsecured notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the unsecured notes.
The Issuers at any time may terminate their obligations under the covenants described under

80


-----

“—Certain Covenants” for the benefit of the holders of the unsecured notes, the operation of the
clauses (3), (5), (6) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries), (7) and (8) under “—Defaults” and
the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”
(“covenant defeasance”) for the benefit of the holders of the unsecured notes. If the Issuers
exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary
Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to the unsecured notes and its
Subsidiary Guarantee.

The Issuers may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior exercise
of their covenant defeasance option. If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option,
payment of the unsecured notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with
respect thereto. If the Issuers exercise their covenant defeasance option, payment of the
unsecured notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3),
(4), (5), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (7) or (8) under “—Defaults” or
because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with clause (4) under “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

In order to exercise their defeasance option, the Issuers must irrevocably deposit in trust

(the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations in an amount
that is sufficient for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the unsecured
notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
beneficial owners of the unsecured notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of
legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law); provided that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall
be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption,
with any deficit as of the date of the redemption only required to be deposited with the Trustee
on or prior to the date of the redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of
Counsel required by the immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance
need not be delivered if all of the unsecured notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers.

**Registration Rights**

The Issuers will not be obligated under any registration rights agreement or other
obligation to register the resale of the unsecured notes or to register the exchange of the
unsecured notes under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of any jurisdiction. The
indenture will not be qualified under the TIA and the Issuers will not be required to comply with
the provisions of the TIA. The absence of registration rights may adversely impact the
transferability of the unsecured notes.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association will be the Trustee under the indenture and will be
appointed by the Issuers as registrar and a paying agent with regard to the unsecured notes.

81


-----

In the event that the Issuers or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, repays, repurchases

in which case interest expense shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period) or issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, repayment,
repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as
determined in accordance with GAAP) and any operational changes, business realignment
projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations that the Issuers or any
Restricted Subsidiary have determined to make and/or made during the four-quarter reference
period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the
Fixed Charge Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a “pro forma event”) shall
be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,

96


-----

dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other
operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings
or reorganizations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If
since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged with or into an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued operation, operational change, business
realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization that would have
required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change,
business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. If since the beginning of such
period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted
Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma
event, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments
appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Issuers as set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements,
synergies or cost savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event, and (2) all
adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” as set
forth in the offering memorandum for the unsecured notes (including the documents
incorporated by reference therein) or otherwise consistent with the indenture to the extent such
adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the
applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate
based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other
rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in giving effect to each New
Project which commences operations and records not less than one full fiscal quarter’s
operations during such period, the operating results of such New Project shall be annualized on
a straight line basis during such period, taking into account any seasonality adjustments
determined by the Issuers in good faith.

For purposes of this definition, any amount in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be
converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the most

97

consistent with that used in calculating EBITDA for the applicable period.

have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession; provided, however,
that (i) if the Issuers notify the Trustee that the Issuers request an amendment to any provision
hereof to eliminate the effect of any change in accounting principles or change as a result of the
adoption or modification of accounting policies occurring after the Issue Date in GAAP or in the
application thereof on the operation of such provision, regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision
shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such
change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such
provision amended in accordance with this definition, and (ii) any calculation or determination
in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP across multiple quarters need not be
calculated or determined using the same accounting standard for each constituent quarter. The
Issuers will give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the
Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action)
referred to in this definition will not (1) be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness or (2) have
the effect of rendering invalid any payment, Investment or other action made prior to the date of
such election pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” or any incurrence of Indebtedness incurred prior to the date of such
election pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (or any
other action conditioned on the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries having been able to
incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness) if such payment, Investment, incurrence or other action
was valid under the Indenture on the date made, incurred or taken, as the case may be. For the
purposes of the indenture, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person shall mean such
Person consolidated with its Restricted Subsidiaries, and shall not include any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, but the interest of such Person in an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be accounted for
as an Investment.

collection in the ordinary course of business), direct or indirect, in any manner (including,
without limitation, letters of credit and reimbursement agreements in respect thereof), of all or
any part of any Indebtedness or other obligations. The amount of any guarantee shall be
deemed to be an amount equal to the stated or determinable amount of the Indebtedness in
respect of which such guarantee is made or, if not stated or determinable, the maximum
reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such person in good faith.

“Hedge Bank” shall mean any person that, at the time it enters into a Hedging Agreement,

case of the foregoing, whether or not exchange traded; provided, that no phantom stock or

shall be a Hedging Agreement.

however, that any Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person existing at the time such person
becomes a Subsidiary (whether by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, acquisition or
otherwise) shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Person at the time it becomes a Subsidiary.

“Indebtedness” means, with respect to any Person:

(1) the principal of any indebtedness of such Person, whether or not contingent, (a) in
respect of borrowed money, (b) evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or similar
instruments or letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances (or, without duplication,

business or consistent with past practice or industry norm, (ii) any earn-out obligations
until such obligation becomes a liability on the balance sheet of such Person in
accordance with GAAP and (iii) liabilities accrued in the ordinary course of business or

pay, as obligor, guarantor or otherwise, the obligations referred to in clause (1) of

(3) to the extent not otherwise included, Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien

asset at such date of Incurrence, and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness of
such other Person;

provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness shall be deemed not to
include (1) Contingent Obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice and not in respect of borrowed money; (2) deferred or prepaid revenues;
(3) purchase price holdbacks in respect of a portion of the purchase price of an asset to satisfy

accounting for any embedded derivatives created by the terms of such Indebtedness; and any
such amounts that would have constituted Indebtedness under the indenture but for the
application of this sentence shall not be deemed an Incurrence of Indebtedness under the
indenture.

firm or consultant, in each case of nationally recognized standing, that is, in the good faith
determination of the Issuers, qualified to perform the task for which it has been engaged.

therein, or the financing thereof, by selling or borrowing against Securitization Assets and any
Hedging Obligations or hedging agreements entered into in connection with such Securitization
Assets; provided, that recourse to an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Special

an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, repays, repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which Pro Forma EBITDA is being
calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of Pro Forma EBITDA is made (the
“Pro Forma EBITDA Calculation Date”), then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro
forma effect to such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such
issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if the same had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as
determined in accordance with GAAP) and any operational changes, business realignment

projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations that an Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary has determined to make and/or made during the four-quarter reference
period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Pro
Forma EBITDA Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a “pro forma event”) shall
be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other
operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings
or reorganizations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in

beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued operation, operational change, business
realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization that would have
required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated
giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition,
discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business
realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. If since the beginning of such period any
Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is
designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma
event, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments
appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Issuers as set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements,
synergies or cost savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event, and (2) all
adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” as set
forth in the offering memorandum for the unsecured notes (including the documents
incorporated by reference therein) or otherwise consistent with the indenture to the extent such
adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Pro Forma
EBITDA Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account
any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the
applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate
based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other
rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in giving effect to each New
Project which commences operations and records not less than one full fiscal quarter’s

subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Secured Leverage Ratio is being
calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Secured Leverage Ratio is made

business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. If since the beginning of such

115

period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted
Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Secured Leverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma
event, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments
appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Issuers as set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements,
synergies or cost savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event, and (2) all
adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” as set
forth in the offering memorandum for the unsecured notes (including the documents
incorporated by reference therein) or otherwise consistent with the indenture to the extent such
adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Secured Leverage
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma

additional Indebtedness is Incurred. In the event that an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
Incurs, repays, repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of
the period for which the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to the event
for which the calculation of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is made (the “Senior Secured

shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation,
discontinued operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New
Project, restructuring or reorganization, in each case with respect to an operating unit of a
business, that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if
such Investment, acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project,
restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period. If since the beginning of such period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary,
then the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for

117


-----

such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma
event, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments

interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Senior Secured
Leverage Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account
any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the
applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate
based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a Eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other
rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in giving effect to each New
Project which commences operations and records not less than one full fiscal quarter’s
operations during such period, the operating results of such New Project shall be annualized on
a straight line basis during such period, taking into account any seasonality adjustments
determined by the Issuers in good faith.

For purposes of this definition, any amount in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be

determined in accordance with GAAP) and any operational changes, business realignment
projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations that the Issuers or any
Restricted Subsidiary has determined to make and/or made during the four-quarter reference
period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the

and other operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects,
restructurings or reorganizations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations
and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since
the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued operation, operational change, business

shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or
reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. If since the

forth in the offering memorandum for the unsecured notes (including the documents
incorporated by reference therein) or otherwise consistent with the indenture to the extent such
adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Total
Indebtedness Leverage Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging
Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized
Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the
applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate
based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other
rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in giving effect to each New
Project which commences operations and records not less than one full fiscal quarter’s
operations during such period, the operating results of such New Project shall be annualized on
a straight line basis during such period, taking into account any seasonality adjustments
determined by the Issuers in good faith.

For purposes of this definition, any amount in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be
converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the most
recent twelve month period immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner
consistent with that used in calculating EBITDA for the applicable period.

“Transactions” means the transactions described under “Summary—The Transactions.”

“Treasury Rate” means, as of the applicable redemption date, as determined by the Issuers,
the yield to maturity as of such redemption date of United States Treasury securities with a
constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical
Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two business days prior to such
redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available
source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from such redemption date
to, 2022; provided, however, that if the period from such redemption date
to, 2022, as applicable, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actively
traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be
used.

### DESCRIPTION OF FIRST-PRIORITY NOTES

The 2024 Notes will be issued under an indenture (the “2024 Indenture”), among Prime
Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”), Prime
Finance Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Co-Issuer,” together with the Company, the “Issuers”
and each, an “Issuer”), the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

The 2026 Notes will be issued under an indenture (the “2026 Indenture, and together with
the 2024 Indenture, the “Indentures” and each, an “Indenture”), among the Issuers, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee.

We urge you to read the Notes, the Indentures, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements because they, not the summaries below, define your rights. You may
obtain a copy of these documents as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section shall have the respective meanings
set forth in the Indentures.

**General**

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuers and will have the benefit of the firstpriority security interests in the Collateral described below under “—Security.” We will issue a
total of $750,000,000 initial aggregate principal amount of % First-Priority Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and $750,000,000 initial aggregate principal amount of %
First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”, and, together with the 2024
Notes, the “Notes”). Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indentures
and this “Description of First-Priority Notes,” references to the Notes include any additional
notes actually issued, see “—Additional Notes”.

The 2024 Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per year. The 2026 Notes will bear interest
at a rate of % per year. The date from which interest will accrue on each series of Notes will
be from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date on which
interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually in arrears
on and of each year, to the holders of record at the close of business on
the and prior to each interest payment date. The basis upon which interest
shall be calculated will be that of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

The Notes will be issuable in whole in the registered form of one or more global securities,
and the depository for such global securities shall be The Depository Trust Company, New York,
New York. The Notes will be issuable in denominations of $2,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

Except as provided below, the Notes shall not be subject to redemption, repurchase or
repayment at the option of any holder thereof, upon the occurrence of any particular
circumstances or otherwise. The Notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund. The Notes
are not convertible into shares of common stock or other securities of the Issuers.

Barclays Bank PLC, the administrative agent and collateral agent under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, will also be the collateral agent, either in its own capacity or by means of a
subagent or a designee, for the holders of the Notes. The rights of the holders of the Notes with
respect to the Collateral that will secure the Notes on a first-priority basis will be subject to a

124


-----

First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2016, as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified, and a First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified.

We and the Subsidiary Guarantors will not be obligated to offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under U.S. securities laws or register the reoffer and resale of the Notes under
U.S. securities laws. As a result, the transferability of the Notes may be negatively affected. By
receiving the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements,
representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Indentures will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“TIA”), and the Issuers will not be required to comply with the provisions of the TIA. Therefore,
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the TIA
or similar provisions in the Indentures.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be senior
Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, respectively, will rank pari passu in
right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuers and the
Subsidiary Guarantors, will have the benefit of the security interest in the Collateral as
described under “—Security” and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future
subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The Notes will have the benefit of a security interest in the Collateral that will be first in
priority and pari passu with the liens securing the obligations under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the ADT Notes and all other existing and future First Priority Lien Obligations, and
senior in priority to the Second Lien Notes (if any) and all other existing and future Second
Priority Lien Obligations, with respect to all Collateral, subject to certain permitted liens and
exceptions described under “—Security.” All of the Issuers’ Domestic Subsidiaries that are
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries and that guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement, the
ADT Notes, the Second Lien Notes (if any) or any other Indebtedness of either Issuer or any of
the Subsidiary Guarantors will become Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the Notes, and
their assets and property will secure the Notes to the extent described below under
“—Security.”

As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions
(assuming the Full Redemption), the Issuers and their Subsidiaries would have had:

(1) $8,774 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting First Priority Lien Obligations,
consisting of $3,524 million of secured Indebtedness outstanding under the First Lien
Credit Agreement (including $100 million drawn under the revolving facility of the First
Lien Credit Agreement), $3,750 million aggregate principal amount of secured
Indebtedness outstanding under the ADT Notes and $1,500 million aggregate principal
amount of secured Indebtedness outstanding under the Notes;

(2) no outstanding Indebtedness constituting Second Priority Lien Obligations;

(3) $1,250.0 million of outstanding Indebtedness under the Unsecured Notes (as defined in
this offering memorandum); and

(4) no Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not Subsidiary Guarantors.

In addition, as of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions (assuming the Full Redemption), the Issuers would have had $400 million of

125


-----

unutilized capacity (without giving effect to letters of credit) under the revolving facility of the
First Lien Credit Agreement, which would constitute First Priority Lien Obligations.

The Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries are able to incur additional amounts of
Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be
substantial and, subject to certain limitations, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness
constituting First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations.

Unless a Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary,
including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary,
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of the Issuers, including holders of the Notes. The holders of the Notes,
therefore, will be effectively subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuers
that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor. As of the Issue Date, our only Subsidiaries that are not
Subsidiary Guarantors will be (i) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (ii) Immaterial Subsidiaries (as
such term is defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof),
(iii) Foreign Subsidiaries and (iv) Subsidiaries of the foregoing, all of which, as of December 31,
2018, had no outstanding Indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations.

**Security**

The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests
(subject to certain permitted liens) in the Collateral. The Collateral consists of substantially all of
the property and assets, in each case, that are held by any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor,
to the extent that such assets secure the other First Priority Lien Obligations.

The initial Collateral does not include, subject to certain exceptions:

(i) any real property other than Material Real Property;

(ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title and letter of credit
rights (in each case, except to the extent a Lien on such assets or such rights can be
perfected by filing a UCC-1 financing statement) and commercial tort claims with a
value of less than $10,000,000;

(iii) assets to the extent the pledges and security interests therein are prohibited by
applicable law, rule, regulation or contractual obligation permitted under the First
Lien Credit Agreement, the Security Documents and certain other documents and
binding on assets to the extent in existence on May 2, 2016 or on the date of
acquisition thereof and not entered into in contemplation of acquisition of such asset
(in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code) or which could require governmental (including regulatory)
consent, approval, license or authorization to be pledged (unless such consent,
approval, license or authorization has been received);

(iv) assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to
result in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by the
Company in consultation with the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent;

(v) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness with respect to which the First-Priority Collateral
Agent and the Company reasonably agree that the cost or other consequences of
pledging such Equity Interests or Indebtedness under the Security Documents are
likely to be excessive in relation to the value to be afforded thereby;

126


-----

(vi) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiary that is a
CFC (in each case, that is owned directly by an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) to
secure the Notes Obligations, any voting Equity Interest of such Foreign Subsidiary in
excess of 65% of the outstanding Equity Interests of such class;

(vii) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any FSHCO (in each case, that
is owned directly by an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) to secure the Notes
Obligations, any voting Equity Interest of such FSHCO in excess of 65% of the
outstanding Equity Interests of such class;

(viii) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness to the extent the pledge thereof would be
prohibited by any requirement of law;

(ix) any Equity Interests of any Person that is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary to the
extent (A) that a pledge thereof to secure the Notes Obligations is prohibited by
(i) any applicable organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder
agreement or (ii) any other contractual obligation with an unaffiliated third party not
in violation of certain provisions of the First Lien Credit Agreement (other than, in this
subclause (A)(ii), customary non-assignment provisions which are ineffective under
Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable requirements of law),
(B) any organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement
(or other contractual obligation referred to in subclause (A)(ii) above) prohibits such a
pledge without the consent of any other party; provided, that this clause (B) shall not
apply if (1) such other party is an Issuer, Holdings, a Subsidiary Guarantor or a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary or (2) consent has been obtained to consummate such
pledge (it being understood that the foregoing shall not be deemed to obligate an
Issuer or any Subsidiary to obtain any such consent) and shall apply for so long as
such organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement
or replacement or renewal thereof is in effect, or (C) a pledge thereof to secure the
Notes Obligations would give any other party (other than an Issuer, Holdings, a
Subsidiary Guarantor or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) to any organizational
documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement governing such
Equity Interests (or other contractual obligation referred to in subclause (A)(ii) above)
the right to terminate its obligations thereunder (other than, in the case of other
contractual obligations referred to in subclause (A)(ii), customary non-assignment
provisions which are ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or
other applicable requirement of law);

(x) any Equity Interests of any Immaterial Subsidiary (as such term is defined in the First
Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof), any Unrestricted Subsidiary or
any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary (as each such term is defined in the
First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof);

(xi) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of, or other Equity Interests owned by, a
Foreign Subsidiary;

(xii) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Equity
Interests could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax
consequences to an Issuer or any Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the
Company in consultation with the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent;

(xiii) any Equity Interests that are set forth on certain schedules to the First Lien Credit
Agreement or that have been identified on or prior to May 2, 2016 in writing to the
First-Priority Collateral Agent by the Company;

(xiv) any margin stock;

127


-----

(xv) any lease, license or other agreement to the extent that a grant of a security interest
therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or create a right
of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than Holdings or any Issuer
or any Subsidiary Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code;

(xvi) those assets as to which the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the Company
reasonably agree that the cost or other consequence of obtaining such a security
interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the value afforded thereby;

(xvii) any governmental licenses or state or local licenses, franchises, charters and
authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or
authorizations are prohibited or restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable
anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code;

(xviii) any “intent-to-use” applications for trademark or service mark registrations filed
pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051, unless and until an
Amendment to Allege Use or a Statement of Use under Section 1(c) or 1(d) of the
Lanham Act has been filed, (xix) other customary exclusions under applicable local law
or in applicable local jurisdictions set forth in the applicable Security Documents;

(xix) Securitization Assets (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) sold to any
Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary or otherwise pledged, factored, transferred
or sold in connection with any Permitted Securitization Financing (as defined in the
First Lien Credit Agreement), and any other assets subject to Liens securing Permitted
Securitization Financings;

(xx) any segregated accounts or funds, or any portion thereof, received by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as agent on behalf of third parties in accordance with a
written agreement that imposes a duty upon the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries to collect and remit those funds to such third parties;

(xxi) any equipment or other asset that is subject to certain liens permitted under the First
Lien Credit Agreement or is otherwise subject to a purchase money debt or a
Capitalized Lease Obligation, in each case, as permitted by certain provisions of the
First Lien Credit Agreement, if the contract or other agreement providing for such
debt or Capitalized Lease Obligation prohibits or requires the consent of any Person
(other than Holdings or an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) as a condition to the
creation of any other security interest on such equipment or asset and, in each case,
such prohibition or requirement is permitted hereunder after giving effect to the
applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or
other applicable law; and

(xxii) certain other exceptions described in the Security Documents, including the limitation
on stock Collateral described below (all such excluded assets referred to as “Excluded
Assets”).

The foregoing excluded property and assets do not secure any of the First Priority Lien
Obligations or the Second Priority Lien Obligations. The security interests securing the Notes
are pari passu in priority with any and all security interests at any time granted to secure the
First Priority Lien Obligations and are also subject to certain permitted liens. The First Priority
Lien Obligations include the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, as well as
certain hedging obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management
services, and the ADT Notes.

128


-----

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the Collateral Agent may grant
extensions of time or waiver of requirement for the creation or perfection of security interests in
or the obtaining of insurance (including title insurance) or surveys with respect to particular
assets (including extensions beyond the Closing Date for the perfection of security interests in
the assets of the Loan Parties on such date) where it reasonably determines, in consultation
with the Company, that perfection or obtaining of such items cannot be accomplished without
undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required by the
indentures or the other Security Documents, (B) no control agreement or control, lockbox or
similar arrangement shall be required with respect to any deposit accounts, securities accounts
or commodities accounts, (C) no landlord, mortgagee or bailee waivers shall be required, (D) no
foreign-law governed security documents or perfection under foreign law shall be required,
(E) no notice shall be required to be sent to account debtors or other contractual third parties
prior to an Event of Default.

The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors are able to incur additional Indebtedness in the
future that could share in the Collateral, including additional First Priority Lien Obligations that
would be secured on a pari passu basis and obligations that would be secured on a junior
priority basis with the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees. Under the Indentures, there are no
limitations on the incurrence of such Indebtedness or other Indebtedness.

**Limitations on Stock Collateral**

The Capital Stock and securities of a Subsidiary that are owned by any Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor will constitute Collateral only to the extent that such Capital Stock and
securities can secure the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, without
Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requiring separate financial
statements of such Subsidiary to be filed with the SEC (or any other governmental agency). In
the event that Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires or is
amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or
regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with
the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary
due to the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities secure the Notes or any
Subsidiary Guarantee, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall
automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral (but only to the extent necessary to not
be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to such
requirement). In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the
consent of the Trustee or any holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security
interests on the shares of Capital Stock and securities that are so deemed to no longer
constitute part of the Collateral. Since the Notes do not have registration rights, this limitation
will not limit the Collateral on the Issue Date.

In the event that Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended,
modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or
any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital
Stock or securities to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing
with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such
Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be
deemed to be a part of the Collateral (but only to the extent that it will not result in such
Subsidiary being subject to any such financial statement requirement). In such event, the
Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of the Trustee or any
holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to subject to the Liens under the Security Documents
such additional Capital Stock and securities, on the terms contemplated herein.

129


-----

You may not have a perfected security interest in all of the Collateral as of the Issue Date.
For example, some or all of the amendments to the Mortgages needed to cause the Notes and
Subsidiary Guarantees to be secured thereby may not be in place upon the issuance of the
Notes. However, to the extent that any instrument or deliverable is required for such perfection,
the Issuers will be required to use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such
instruments and deliverables within 120 days following the Issue Date or such longer period of
time as agreed to by the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent with respect to perfecting security
interests in such Collateral thereunder.

If any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to enter into a Security Document after using
commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuers shall be solely responsible for determining whether
they have used commercially reasonable efforts, which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the First-Priority Collateral Agent (upon which the
Trustee and the First-Priority Collateral Agent may conclusively rely without any investigation),
and the Issuers shall notify the holders of Notes. Neither the First-Priority Collateral Agent nor
the Trustee shall have any obligation to enter into such an agreement and shall have the right to
decline signing such an agreement if, after being advised by counsel, the Trustee or FirstPriority Collateral Agent determines in good faith that such action would expose the Trustee or
First-Priority Collateral Agent to liability or if doing so is not consistent with its rights, privileges,
protections and immunities set forth in the Indentures, the Security Documents or other
documents governing the Notes.

**Maintenance of Collateral**

The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that any Issuer will, and will cause each
of the Subsidiary Guarantors to (i) at all times maintain, preserve and protect all property
material to the conduct of its business and keep such property in good repair, working order
and condition (other than wear and tear); (ii) keep its insurable property adequately insured at
all times by financially sound and reputable insurers; and (iii) maintain such other insurance, to
such extent and against such risks as is customary with companies in the same or similar
businesses operating in the same or similar locations.

**After-Acquired Collateral**

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset (other than Excluded Assets)
to secure any First Priority Lien Obligations (which include obligations in respect of the First
Lien Credit Agreement and the ADT Notes), it must concurrently grant a first-priority security
interest (subject to certain permitted liens) in favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for its
benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and deliver certain joinder
agreements and certificates in respect thereof to the extent required by the Security Documents.

**Further Assurances**

The Security Documents and the Indenture provide that the Issuers and the Subsidiary
Guarantors shall, at their expense, duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and
delivered, such further agreements, documents, instruments, financing and continuation
statements and amendments thereto and do or cause to be done such further acts as may be
necessary or proper to evidence, perfect, maintain and enforce the security interests and the
priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for its benefit and
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee, and to otherwise effectuate the
provisions or purposes of the Indenture and the Security Documents.

130


-----

**Security Documents**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the First Lien Credit
Agreement entered into a security agreement and mortgages in connection with the First Lien
Credit Agreement. The trustee for the ADT Notes joined such Security Documents prior to the
date hereof. On the Issue Date the Trustee for the Notes will join the security agreement by
executing a joinder to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and will appoint the FirstPriority Collateral Agent as collateral agent for the Notes.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the
Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to
collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

**First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent and the trustee of
the ADT Notes are parties to that certain First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, dated as
of May 2, 2016 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement”), with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended or
supplemented from time to time without the consent of the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent,
the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or any other First Priority Secured Party to add other
parties holding First Priority Lien Obligations not prohibited to be incurred under the Indentures,
the First Lien Credit Agreement and the agreements governing any other First Priority Lien
Obligations. On the Issue Date, the Trustee will deliver a joinder to the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

The First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement governs the relative rights and remedies
with respect to the Collateral of the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the holders
of the Notes, the holders of the ADT Notes and the holders of any other First Priority Lien
Obligations. Under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the
“Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent
to foreclose on Common Collateral and take other actions with respect to the Common
Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations
have no right to so direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent or to take actions with respect to the
Common Collateral. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” will initially be the First Lien
Credit Agreement Agent, and the Trustee for the holders of the Notes, as Authorized
Representative in respect of the Notes, will initially have no rights to take any action with
respect to the Common Collateral under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The
First-Priority Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, at the request of the FirstPriority Collateral Agent, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such
amendment) to any Security Document (including, without limitation, to release any Liens
securing any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations), so long as such amendment is not
prohibited by the terms of the documents governing each Series of First Priority Lien
Obligations. The First-Priority Collateral Agent may additionally enter into any amendment (and,
at the request (of the First-Priority Collateral Agent, each Authorized Representative shall sign a
consent to such amendment) to any Security Document solely as such amendment to such
Security Document relates to a particular Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (including,
without limitation, to release Liens securing such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations);
provided that any such amendment is in accordance with the documents pursuant to which
such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations was incurred and such amendment does not
adversely affect the First-Priority Secured Parties of any other Series.

131


-----

The First Lien Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative
until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable
Authorized Agent Date”). From and after the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable
Authorized Representative, with respect to any Common Collateral, will be the Authorized
Representative (the “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”) of the Series of First Priority
Lien Obligations (other than obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement) that constitutes
the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Lien
Obligations with respect to such Common Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative”). As of the Issue Date, the trustee for the ADT Notes will be the Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date”, with respect to any
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, is the date that is 180 days (throughout which
180-day period the applicable Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default,
under and as defined in the applicable Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for
that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, and (b) the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s and each
other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an Event of Default, as defined in the
applicable Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First Priority
Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Lien Obligations of the
Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized
Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof
or otherwise) in accordance with the applicable Indenture or other applicable indenture or
agreement for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be
deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Common Collateral (1) at any time the Credit
Agreement Agent or the First-Priority Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently
pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Common Collateral or (2) at any time any
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common
Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to instruct the FirstPriority Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral. The
First-Priority Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common
Collateral from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First-Priority Secured
Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative), and no Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized
Representative) will instruct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or
non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator
or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any
right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security
interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common
Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the First-Priority
Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may
deal with the Common Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior
Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any Non-Controlling

132


-----

Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by
the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling
Secured Party or any other exercise by the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable
Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating
to the Common Collateral or cause the First-Priority Collateral Agent to do so. Each other
Authorized Representative agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not accept any Lien on
any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other Series of First
Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or
defeasance of the Indentures or the agreement governing such other Series of First Priority Lien
Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each of the FirstPriority Secured Parties also agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not (and will waive
any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien
held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the
Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien/
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a
third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any enforcement by the First-Priority
Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions thereof, the Liens in favor of the First-Priority
Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First-Priority Secured Parties upon such
Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged.

If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First Priority Lien
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any FirstPriority Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or
any distribution is made in respect of any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of any
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment
pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other
liquidation of any such Common Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or received by the
First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such
intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such
distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the paragraph
immediately following) to which the First Priority Lien Obligations are entitled under any other
intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First Priority Lien Obligations to the
payment in full of the First Priority Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all
amounts owing to the First-Priority Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third
party (other than a First-Priority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable
intercreditor agreements) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security
interest of any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate
legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First
Priority Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common
Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a
ratable basis solely from the Common Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the
Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to which such impairment exists.

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit,
bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First-Priority Collateral Agent
or any other First-Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific
performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition,
none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part

133


-----

thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any FirstPriority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or
payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of First Priority Lien
Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the
other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or
payment to the First-Priority Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien/
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First
Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
shall, as debtor(s)-in possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be
provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code
or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority
Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of
any Controlling Secured Party) agrees that it will raise no objection to any such DIP Financing or
to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any
use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party,
or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to
such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent
that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the
benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate
its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the
Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to
secure the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each
Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Common
Collateral as set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long
as:

(A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all
such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising
after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the
other First-Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the
bankruptcy case,

(B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional
collateral pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or
otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the
same priority vis-a-vis the other First-Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First
Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the
First Priority Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien/First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and

(D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the
form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash
collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First
Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the
grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the

134


-----

First-Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not
constitute Common Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Priority Secured Parties
receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving
adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Priority
Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First-Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Priority Lien Obligations of any
Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the documents governing each Series of First
Priority Lien Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented,
restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time,
all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any Series.

**First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent and the Applicable Second Lien Agent are party to the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified, the “First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”),
with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended or supplemented from time to time
without the consent of the Trustee, the holders of the Notes, any other First Priority Secured
Party or any Second Priority Secured Party to add other parties holding First Priority Lien
Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations not prohibited to be incurred under the
Indentures, the First Lien Credit Agreement, the agreements governing any other First Priority
Lien Obligations and the agreements governing any Second Priority Lien Obligations. On the
Issue Date, if any Second Lien Notes remain outstanding and the indenture for the Second Lien
Notes has not been discharged in accordance with its terms, the Trustee will execute and deliver
a joinder to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, at any time
prior to the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, the Applicable First Lien Agent and other
representatives of the First Priority Lien Obligations will have the exclusive right to enforce
rights, exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral subject to other provisions of the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

So long as the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Applicable
Second Lien Agent will not be permitted to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or
recoupment) with respect to the Collateral, except they may take certain specified permitted
remedies, including:

(a) the Applicable Second Lien Agent will be permitted to take certain protective measures
described in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

(b) the Applicable Second Lien Agent will have a right to exercise rights or remedies with
respect to the Collateral after a period of 180 days has elapsed since the delivery of the notice of
the acceleration of the applicable Second Priority Lien Obligations to the applicable first lien
agent, if no holder of First Priority Lien Obligations is diligently pursuing the enforcement or
exercise of rights or remedies with respect to a material portion of Collateral or requested a
relief of any stay to enable commencement of such exercise, any such acceleration has not been
rescinded and no Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor is then a debtor in any insolvency proceeding,

(c) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any
motion, claim, adversary proceeding, or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or

135


-----

otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Second Lien Secured Parties,
including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the terms of the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

(d) file any pleadings, objections motions, or agreements that assert rights or interests
available to unsecured creditors of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor arising under either
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not
inconsistent with or prohibited by the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or applicable law (including the bankruptcy laws of an applicable jurisdiction), or

(e) vote on any plan of reorganization, file any proof of claim, make other filings and make
any arguments, obligations, and motions (including in support of or opposition to, as
applicable, the confirmation or approval of any plan of reorganization) that are, in each case, in
accordance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain limited rights, the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that it will not
take any action that would hinder or interfere with any exercise of remedies undertaken by any
holder of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Collateral and waived any and all
rights it or any such Second Lien Secured Party may have as a junior lien creditor or otherwise
to object to the manner in which any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations seeks to enforce or
collect the First Priority Lien Obligations or the Liens granted to secure any First Priority Lien
Obligations, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by such holder is adverse to the
interests of the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time
any Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations delivers
notice to the Applicable Second Lien Agent that any specified Collateral held by such Person (or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof) is disposed of (other than to an Issuer or a Subsidiary
Guarantor) (i) by the owner of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the
documents governing First Priority Lien Obligations and Second Priority Lien Obligations or
(ii) during the existence of any Event of Default under (and as defined in) the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any applicable documents governing other First Priority Lien Obligations in
connection with any enforcement action, exercise of rights or remedies or to the extent that the
applicable first lien agent has consented to such disposition, then the Liens securing the Second
Priority Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as
and upon, but only to the extent, such Liens on such Common Collateral securing the First
Priority Lien Obligations are released and discharged.

In addition, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the
Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, except as provided in the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement (1) the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations and the First-Priority
Collateral Agent shall have the exclusive right to make determinations regarding the release of
Collateral without the consent of any Second Lien Secured Parties, (2) the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement may be supplemented, without the consent of the Applicable Second
Lien Agent or the holders of any Second Priority Lien Obligations, to add additional secured
creditors holding other First Priority Lien Obligations and other Second Priority Lien Obligations
so long as such other First Priority Lien Obligations or other Second Priority Lien Obligations, as
applicable, are not prohibited by the provisions of the First Lien Credit Agreement, the
Indentures, the documents governing any other First Priority Lien Obligations or the documents
governing any Second Priority Lien Obligations and (2) in the event the holders of the First
Priority Lien Obligations change, waive, modify or vary the Security Documents, such
modification will automatically apply to the comparable provisions of the security documents

136


-----

governing the Second Priority Lien Obligations without the consent of any holders of the
Second Priority Lien Obligations, provided that any such change, waiver or modification does
not materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations
to a greater extent than the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations in a like or similar
manner.

In addition if any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of any Second Priority Lien
Obligations agreed that:

(1) until the Discharge of First-Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the First-Priority
Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use, sale or lease of cash collateral or to
permit such Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing, they will not
object to, or support any objection to or otherwise contest, and will be deemed to have
consented to, such use, sale or lease of such cash collateral and DIP Financing and will
not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to
the extent permitted by clause 7 below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the First
Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will
subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating
thereto, including any “carve-out” from the Collateral granting administrative priority
status or Lien priority to secure the payment of fees and expenses of the United States
Trustee or professionals retained by any debtor or creditors’ committee agreed to by
the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the other holders of First Priority Lien Obligations)
and to any adequate protection Liens granted to the First-Priority Collateral Agent, on
the same basis as the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated
to the Liens securing the DIP Financing; provided, that the aggregate principal amount
of the DIP Financing does not exceed the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of the First
Priority Lien Obligations (after taking into account any “roll-up” thereof) and (2) an
amount equal to 100% of the aggregate commitments (whether drawn or undrawn)
under such then existing revolving credit facilities, in each case determined as of the
commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

(2) they will raise no objection to, and will not support any objection to or otherwise
contest, any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against
foreclosure or enforcement in respect of any First Priority Lien Obligations made by the
First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations;

(3) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest,
any lawful exercise by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority
Lien Obligations of the right to credit bid the First Priority Lien Obligations under
Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other
applicable Bankruptcy Law) or at any sale in foreclosure or in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding of the Collateral or other collateral securing any First Priority
Lien Obligations;

(4) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest,
any other request for judicial relief made in any court by the First-Priority Collateral
Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement
of any Lien on any Collateral or other Collateral securing any First Priority Lien
Obligations;

(5) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest,
any order relating to a sale of any Collateral of any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor for
which the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations

137


-----

has consented that provides, to the extent that the sale is to be free and clear of Liens,
that the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations and the Second Priority Lien
Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the
Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations do relate to the Liens securing the
Second Priority Lien Obligations in accordance with the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, provided that the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the
holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations may assert any objection to the proposed
bidding or related sale procedures to be utilized in connection with a sale or disposition
that could be asserted by an unsecured creditor in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding;

(6) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they will not (i) seek
relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding in respect of the Collateral or any other collateral securing any First Priority
Lien Obligations without the prior written consent of all First-Priority Collateral Agent or
the required lenders under each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations or (ii) oppose
the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations from
seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay;

(7) none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (a) any request by
the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations for
adequate protection in any form or (b) any objection by the First-Priority Collateral
Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to any motion, relief, action or
proceeding based on the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s or the holders of First Priority
Lien Obligations’ claiming a lack of adequate protection. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of First Priority
Lien Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of
a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative
claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363
or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the Applicable Second
Lien Agent and any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations (A) may seek or request
adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral
and/or a superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), which Lien or superpriority
claim is junior and subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate
protection for, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations and such
DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens
securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to the
Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under
the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (B) will not seek or request,
without the consent of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or as otherwise set forth in the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, adequate protection in any other form,
and (ii) in the event that the Applicable Second Lien Agent or any holder of Second
Priority Lien Obligations seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate
protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or
a superpriority administrative claim, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that
the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall also be granted a senior Lien on
such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the
applicable First Priority Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing and/or a
superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), and that any Lien on such additional
or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Second
Priority Lien Obligations and/or a superpriority claim shall be junior and subordinated
to the Liens on such collateral securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority
Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and

138


-----

any other Liens granted to the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations as adequate
protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing, and the claims with respect
to, the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to such Liens
securing, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations are granted
adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Applicable Second
Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations shall not be prohibited
from seeking and accepting adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount
of current post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as
applicable), subject to the right of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of
First Priority Lien Obligations to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees
and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Applicable Second Lien Agent
and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations; and

(8) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they (i) will not assert
or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar
provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on a parity with the
Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or
disposing of any Collateral or other collateral, and (ii) will waive any claim it may have
arising out of the election by any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations of the
application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under
any other applicable bankruptcy law).

In addition, under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of Second
Priority Lien Obligations may support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization proposed in
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (and shall be deemed to have voted to reject any such
plan) unless it (a) pays off, in cash in full, all First Priority Lien Obligations, (b) is accepted by the
class of holders of First Priority Lien Obligations voting thereon in accordance with Section 1126
of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law), or
(c) otherwise provides the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations with the value of the
Collateral in cash or otherwise, prior to any payment or distribution on account of the Second
Priority Lien Obligations (subject to a certain other provision of the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement).

The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the parties thereto
agree that (i) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents and the security
documents governing the Second Priority Lien Obligations constitute two separate and distinct
grants of Liens and (ii) because of their differing rights in the Collateral, the Second Priority Lien
Obligations must be separately classified from the First Priority Lien Obligations in any plan of
reorganization proposed or confirmed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The parties
thereto further agree that regardless of whether any claim for interest, fees, costs, or expenses
that accrue after the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding is allowed or
allowable, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement expressly is intended to include
and does include the “rule of explicitness” in that the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement expressly entitles the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of First Priority
Lien Obligations with the right to receive, in respect of the First Priority Lien Obligations,
payment from the Collateral of all such post-petition claims through distributions made
therefrom pursuant to the provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
even if any such post-petition claims are not allowed or allowable against the bankruptcy estate
of any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable

139


-----

bankruptcy law. If it is held that the claims of the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations
and the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute
only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then
the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the
amounts distributed to them from, or in respect of, the Collateral in respect of principal,
prepetition interest, and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition claims,
irrespective of whether any claim for such amounts is allowed or allowable in such insolvency
or liquidation proceeding, before any distribution from, or in respect of, any Collateral is made
in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien Secured Parties, with the holders of the Second
Lien Secured Parties acknowledging and agreeing in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement to turn over to the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations amounts otherwise
received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the
intent of the foregoing, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of
the holders of the Second Lien Secured Parties.

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors are entitled to the automatic release of property
and other assets included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes Obligations under
any one or more of the following circumstances or any applicable circumstance as provided in
the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement:

(1) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the consummation
of any transaction permitted by the Indentures as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor
ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Issuers or otherwise ceases to be a pledgor under the Security
Documents;

(2) to enable the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor to consummate the disposition of
such property or assets to a Person that is not an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent
not prohibited under the Indentures;

(3) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of
such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary;

(4) in respect of the property or assets of an Issuer, upon the release or discharge of such
Issuer’s Notes Obligations in accordance with the Indentures;

(5) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or
discharge of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the
Indentures;

(6) in respect of any property and assets that are or become Excluded Assets pursuant to a
transaction not prohibited under the Indentures;

(7) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or
discharge of the pledge granted by such Subsidiary Guarantor to secure the obligations under
the First Lien Credit Facility or any other Indebtedness the guarantee in respect of which
resulted in the obligation to become a Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Notes; and

(8) upon any sale or other transfer by the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any
Collateral that is permitted under the Indentures to any Person that is not an Issuer or a

otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Indentures and the Notes, whether for
payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or

expenses) incurred by the Trustee in enforcing any rights under the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the
Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law
relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

After the Issue Date, the Issuers will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is

Indebtedness of an Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, including Indebtedness under
the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes or any other First Priority Lien Obligations, to
execute and deliver to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes and (ii) joinders to or new
Security Documents and take all actions required by the Security Documents to perfect the Liens
created thereunder.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment
in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Subsidiary
Guarantor and its successors; and

consolidation, amalgamation, Delaware LLC, Division, dividend, distribution or
otherwise) of the Capital Stock (including any sale, disposition, exchange or other
transfer following which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary), of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, disposition, exchange
or other transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the Indentures;

(2) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or such
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the

Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes;

(4) the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations” or if the Issuers’
obligations under the Indentures are discharged in accordance with the terms of the

(5) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge
or security interest in favor of the First Priority Lien Obligations or other exercise of
remedies in respect thereof.

knowledge of the Issuers’ compliance with all covenants and agreements under the
Indentures required to be complied with by the Issuer.

The following additional covenants shall apply with respect to a series of the Notes so long
as any Notes of such series remain outstanding (but subject to defeasance with respect to such
series, as provided in the applicable Indenture):

**_Reports by the Issuers_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will provide to the applicable Trustee and,
upon request, to beneficial owners of such Notes a copy of all of the information and reports
referred to below:

(1) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
non-accelerated filers, annual reports of the Reporting Entity (as defined below) for

142


-----

such fiscal year containing the information that would have been required to be

the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to
the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
non-accelerated filers, quarterly reports of the Reporting Entity for such fiscal quarter
containing the information that would have been required to be contained in a quarterly
report on Form 10-Q (or any successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had

excluded by the SEC; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
filing current reports on Form 8-K, current reports of the Reporting Entity containing
substantially all of the information that would be required to be filed in a Current

and 4, Items 5.01, 5.02(a)–(d) (other than compensation information), 5.03(b) and Item
9.01 (only to the extent relating to any of the foregoing) of Form 8-K if the Reporting
Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
no such current reports will be required to be furnished if the Issuers or any direct or
indirect parent of the Issuers determines in its good faith judgment that such event is
not material to the holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or
prospects of the Issuers and their Affiliates, taken as a whole.

If at any time the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company has made a
good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to a public
offering of such Person’s Capital Stock, the Company will not be required to disclose any
information or take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Company, would violate the
securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on such
public offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Issuers (and the applicable Reporting Entity) will not
be required to furnish any information, certificates or reports that would otherwise be required
by (i) Section 302 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308

10-Q or Form 8-K (or any such successor or comparable forms) or related rules under
Regulation S-K and (c) such reports shall be subject to exceptions and exclusions consistent
with the presentation of financial and other information in the offering memorandum for the
Notes (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) or otherwise consistent with
the Indentures and shall not be required to present compensation or beneficial ownership
information.

The financial statements, information and other documents required to be provided as
described above, may be those of (i) the Company or (ii) any direct or indirect parent of the
Company (any such entity described in clause (i) or (ii), a “Reporting Entity”), so long as, in the
case of (ii), either (a) such direct or indirect parent of the Company will not conduct, transact or
otherwise engage, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage, in any business or
operations other than its direct or indirect ownership of all of the Equity Interests in, and its
management of the Company or (b) such direct or indirect parent of the Company is or becomes
a guarantor of the applicable series of Notes; provided, that, if the financial information so

143


-----

furnished relates to such direct or indirect parent of the Company pursuant to (ii)(a) above, the
same is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the quantitative differences
between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating
to the Issuers and the guarantors of the Notes on a standalone but consolidated basis, on the
other hand.

In addition to providing such information to the applicable Trustee, the Issuers will make
available to the holders, prospective investors and securities analysts the information required
to be provided pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) of the first paragraph above, by posting such
information to the website of the Issuers (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the
Issuers) or on IntraLinks or any comparable online data system or website.

The Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers will also hold quarterly conference
calls, beginning with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the operative date of the Indentures,
for all holders and securities analysts to discuss such financial information no later than ten
Business Days after the distribution of such information required by this covenant, and prior to
the date of each such conference call, the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers
will announce the time and date of such conference call and either include all information
necessary to access the call in such announcement or inform the holders of each series of
Notes, prospective investors and securities analysts how they can obtain such information,
including, without limitation, the applicable password or other login information (if applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers will be deemed to have furnished such reports
referred to above to the applicable Trustee and holders if the Issuers or a Reporting Entity has
filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such
reports are publicly available. In addition, the requirements of this covenant shall be deemed
satisfied by the posting of reports that would be required to be provided to the holders on the
Issuers’ website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers).

**_Limitation on the Ability to Consolidate, Merge and Sell Assets_**

Each Issuer will covenant that it will not merge or consolidate with any other Person,
consummate a Delaware LLC Division (whether or not such Issuer is the surviving Person or
successor, as applicable) or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any person,
unless:

(1) such Issuer shall be the continuing entity, or the successor entity or the Person which
acquires by sale or conveyance substantially all the assets of such Issuer, (A) shall expressly
assume all of the obligations of such Issuer under the Indentures, (B) is an entity treated as a
“corporation” for U.S. tax purposes and obtains either (x) an opinion, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, of tax counsel of recognized standing reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee, which counsel shall include Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
LLP or (y) a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, in either case to the effect that such
merger, Delaware LLC Division or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, will not result in an
exchange of the Notes for new debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (C) if
such entity is not organized under the laws of the United States or any state of the United
States, then it shall expressly undertake obligations with respect to the Notes comparable to
those initially undertaken by such Issuer with as described under “Payment of Additional
Amounts”; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts (defined in under “Payment of
Additional Amounts”) shall be paid on account of any taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or
official interpretations thereof; and

144


-----

(2) no Event of Default (as defined below) and no event that, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would become an Event of Default shall be continuing immediately after such merger,
Delaware LLC Division or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance.

Such Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed
transaction an officer’s certificate to the forgoing effect and an opinion of counsel stating that
the proposed transaction and any such supplemental indenture comply with the Indentures.

**_Limitations on Liens_**

The Issuers will not, and will not permit any Principal Subsidiary (as defined below) to,
issue, assume or guarantee any Indebtedness that is secured by a lien upon any property that at
the time of such issuance, assumption or guarantee constitutes a Principal Property (as defined
below), or any shares of stock of or Indebtedness issued by any Principal Subsidiary, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, without effectively providing that, for so long as such lien
shall continue in existence with respect to such secured Indebtedness, the Notes (together with,
if the Issuers shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of the Issuers ranking equally with the
Notes, it being understood that for purposes hereof, Indebtedness which is secured by a lien
and Indebtedness which is not so secured shall not, solely by reason of such lien, be deemed to
be of different ranking) are equally and ratably secured by a lien ranking ratably with or equal to

Principal Subsidiary;

   - liens on any Principal Property existing at the time of acquisition thereof by an Issuer or
any Principal Subsidiary, or liens to secure the payment of the purchase price of such
Principal Property by an Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary, or to secure any

guaranteed prior to, at the time of or within one year after such acquisition, or in the
case of real property, completion of such improvement or construction or
commencement of full operation of such property, whichever is later; provided,
however, that in the case of any such acquisition, construction or improvement, the lien

foregoing;

the matters heretofore referred to in this clause, such as interpleader proceedings, and
other similar pledges, liens or deposits made or incurred in the ordinary course of
business;

- liens created by or resulting from any litigation or other proceeding that is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, including liens arising out of

inclusive, together with the Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Back
Transactions permitted by the first bullet under “Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back

such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes
pursuant to the subsection “Limitations on Liens” above; or

   - the direct or indirect proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property to be leased are at

redemption provision) of the Notes, or of Funded Indebtedness of an Issuer or a
consolidated Subsidiary ranking on a parity with or senior to the Notes; provided that
there shall be credited to the amount of net proceeds required to be applied pursuant to
this provision an amount equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the Notes
delivered within 180 days of the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction
to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation and (ii) the principal amount of other
Funded Indebtedness voluntarily retired by an Issuer within such 180-day period,
excluding retirements of the Notes and other Funded Indebtedness as a result of

**Events of Default**

With respect to a particular series of the Notes, an “Event of Default” will mean any one or

the Notes of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at
maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise;

respect of the Notes of such series (other than a default or breach that is specifically

147


-----

dealt with elsewhere), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days
after the date on which there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to such
Issuer by the Trustee or to such Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series issued under the applicable
Indenture affected thereby, a written notice specifying such default or breach and
requiring it to be remedied and stating that the notice is a “Notice of Default” under the
applicable Indenture;

   - a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in
respect of an Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator or similar official of an Issuer or for any
substantial part of its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs,
and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90
consecutive days;

   - an Issuer shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for
relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment of or
taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator
or similar official of an Issuer or for any substantial part of its property, or make any
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

   - any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture or resolution of the
Board of Directors under which the Notes of such series is issued or in the form of
security for such series.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing in respect of the Notes of a
series, in each and every case, unless the principal of all the Notes of the series shall have
already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding, by notice in writing to
the Issuers and, if given by such holders, to the Trustee may declare the unpaid principal of all
the Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes of any series, by written
notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may waive any existing default in the performance of any
of the covenants contained in the applicable Indenture or established with respect to such series
and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on, any of the Notes of that series as and when the same shall become due by the terms
of such Notes. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby and any Event of Default
arising therefrom shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of the applicable Indenture.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any
series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee
with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with
any rule of law or with the applicable Indenture or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders
of securities of any other outstanding series of debt securities. Subject to the terms of the
applicable Indenture, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if
the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the
Trustee in personal liability.

148


-----

No holder of Notes of any series shall have any right to institute any suit, action or
proceeding in equity or at law under the applicable Indenture or to appoint a receiver or trustee,
or to seek any other remedies under the applicable Indenture unless:

   - such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of
Default and the continuance thereof specifying such Event of Default;

   - the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute
such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee;

   - such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity and security
reasonably satisfactory to it as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities
to be incurred therein or thereby;

   - the Trustee, for 60 days after its receipt of such written notice, request and offer of
indemnity and security reasonably satisfactory to it, shall have failed to institute any
such action, suit or proceeding; and

   - during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of
that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.

The right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest
on such security or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment shall not be
impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.

The following additional event shall be established and shall constitute an “Event of
Default” under the applicable Indenture with respect a series of the Notes so long as any of the
Notes of such series remain outstanding:

   - an event of default shall happen and be continuing with respect to an Issuer’s
Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) under any
indenture or other instrument evidencing or under which an Issuer shall have a principal
amount outstanding (such amount with respect to original issue discount bonds or zero
coupon notes, bonds or debentures or similar securities based on the accreted amount
determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
and as of the date of the most recently prepared consolidated balance sheet of such
Issuer) in excess of $100,000,000, and such event of default shall involve the failure to
pay the principal of such Indebtedness on the final maturity date thereof after the
expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or such Indebtedness
shall have been accelerated so that the same shall have become due and payable prior
to the date on which the same would otherwise have become due and payable, and
such acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled within ten Business Days after
notice thereof shall have been given by the Trustee to such Issuer or by the holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series to the
Trustee and such Issuer.

However, this additional Event of Default is subject to the following:

   - if such event of default under such indenture or instrument shall be remedied or cured
by such Issuer or waived by the requisite holders of such Indebtedness, then the event
of default under the applicable Indenture by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to
have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of
either the Trustee or any of the holders; and

   - subject to certain duties, responsibilities and rights of the Trustee under the applicable
Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such event of default

149


-----

unless written notice thereof shall have been given to the Trustee by such Issuer, by the
holder or an agent of the holder of any such Indebtedness, by the Trustee then acting
under any indenture or other instrument under which such default shall have occurred,
or by the holders of not less than 25% in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Notes of such series.

**Modification of an Indenture and the Security Documents**

The Trustee or the collateral agent, as applicable, and the Issuers may from time to time
and at any time amend the Indenture and the Security Documents (subject to the provisions of
the Security Documents) or enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to any Indenture
without the consent of any holders of any series of Notes for one or more of the following
purposes:

   - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture or Security Documents;

   - to add an additional obligor on the debt securities or to add a guarantor of any
outstanding debt securities or to evidence the succession of another Person to an Issuer,

covenants, agreements and obligations of an Issuer, pursuant to provisions in the
Indenture concerning consolidation, merger, Delaware LLC Division, or sale of assets;

   - to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt

powers under the applicable Indenture;

   - to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the holders of any outstanding
debt securities issued under the Indenture;

   - to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture, provided that any such
change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding debt
securities created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is
entitled to the benefit of such provision;

   - to secure the Notes or any guarantee thereof;

   - to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of
outstanding debt securities in any material respect;

   - to issue additional debt securities, including additional notes (see “—Additional Notes”);
provided that such additional debt securities have the same terms as, and are deemed
part of the same securities as, the applicable debt securities to the extent required under
the applicable Indenture; or

   - to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee with
respect to the debt securities and to add to or change any of the provisions of the
Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust
by more than one trustee.

In addition, under the Indentures, with the written consent of the holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each series at the time
outstanding that is affected, the Issuers when authorized by board resolutions, and the Trustee,
from time to time and at any time may amend the Indenture and the Security Documents
(subject to the provisions of the Security Documents) or enter into an indenture or indentures to

150


-----

supplement any Indenture. However, the following changes may only be made with the consent
of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected:

   - extend a fixed maturity of or any installment of principal of any debt securities of any
series or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the amount of principal of any
original issue discount security that would be due and payable upon declaration of
acceleration of the maturity thereof;

   - reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any debt security of any
series;

   - reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt security;

   - make any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt security;

   - impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the fixed
maturity thereof or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date; or

   - reduce the percentage of debt securities, the holders of which are required to consent to
any such supplemental indenture or indentures.

A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant, Event of Default or
other provision of any Indenture that has been expressly included solely for the benefit of one
or more particular series of securities, if any, or which modifies the rights of the holders of
securities of such series with respect to such covenant, Event of Default or other provision, shall
be deemed not to affect the rights under the Indentures of the holders of securities of any other
series.

It will not be necessary for the consent of the holders to approve the particular form of any
proposed supplement, amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of it.

**Information Concerning the Trustee**

In case an Event of Default with respect to the securities of a series has occurred (that has
not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to securities of that series
such of the rights and powers vested in it by the applicable Indenture, and use the same degree
of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. None of the provisions contained in the
Indentures shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or
powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability
is not assured to it under the terms of the Indentures or indemnity and security reasonably
satisfactory to it against such risk is not assured.

The Trustee may resign with respect to one or more series of debt securities by giving a
written notice to the Issuers and to the holders of that series of debt securities. The holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a particular series may
remove the Trustee by notifying the Issuers and the Trustee. The Issuers may remove the
Trustee if:

   - the Trustee has or acquires a “conflicting interest,” within the meaning of Section 310(b)
of the Trust Indenture Act, and fails to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of
the Trust Indenture Act;

151


-----

   - the Trustee fails to comply with the eligibility requirements provided in an Indenture and
fails to resign after written request therefor by the Issuers or by any such holder in
accordance with the Indenture; or

   - the Trustee becomes incapable of acting, or is adjudged to be bankrupt or insolvent, or
commences a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
property is appointed or consented to, or any public officer takes charge or control of the
Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if the office of the Trustee is otherwise vacant, the
Issuers will appoint a successor trustee in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
Indenture.

A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee shall
become effective only upon the successor trustee’s acceptance of the appointment as provided
in the applicable Indenture.

**Payment and Paying Agents**

The interest installment on any security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly
provided for, on the fixed date on which an installment of interest with respect to securities of
that series is due and payable, shall be paid to the Person in whose name such security (or one
or more predecessor securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date
for such interest installment.

The Issuers, upon written notice to the Trustee, may appoint one or more paying agents,
other than the Trustee, for all or any series of the Notes. The notes of a particular series will be
surrendered for payment at the office of the paying agents designated by the Issuers. If the
Issuers do not designate such an office, the corporate trust office of the Trustee will serve as the
office of the paying agent for such series. The Issuers or any of their Subsidiaries may act as
paying agent upon written notice to the Trustee.

All funds paid by the Issuers to a paying agent or the Trustee for the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes which remains unclaimed for at least one
year after such principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable will be
repaid to the Issuers and the holder of the Notes thereafter may look only to the Issuers for
payment thereof.

**Governing Law**

The Indentures and any debt securities issued thereunder shall be deemed to be a contract
made under the internal laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws
principles that would require the application of any other law.

**Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations**

The Issuers’ obligations with respect to any series of the Notes will be discharged and shall
cease to be of further effect upon compliance with the conditions under the caption “Covenant
Defeasance” if, with respect to all Notes of that particular series that have not been previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that have not become due and payable as described

152


-----

below, such notes have been paid by the Issuers by depositing irrevocably with the Trustee, in
trust, funds or governmental obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption
all such outstanding Notes of that series, such deposit to include:

   - principal;

   - premium, if any;

   - interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as
the case may be; and

   - all other payments due under the terms of the applicable Indenture with respect to the
debt securities of such series.

Notwithstanding the above, the Issuers may not be discharged from the following
obligations, which will survive until such date of maturity or the redemption date for the
applicable series of notes:

   - to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes of such series;

   - to execute and authenticate the notes;

   - to replace stolen, lost or mutilated notes; and

   - to appoint new trustees as required.

The Issuers also may not be discharged from the following obligations which will survive
the satisfaction and discharge of the applicable series of Notes:

   - to compensate and reimburse the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Indenture;

   - to receive unclaimed payments held by the Trustee for at least one year after the date
upon which the principal, if any, or interest on the Notes shall have respectively come
due and payable and remit those payments to the holders if required;

   - to withhold or deduct taxes as provided in the applicable Indenture.

**Covenant Defeasance**

Upon compliance with specified conditions, the Issuers will not be required to comply with
some covenants contained in the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with the
obligations will not constitute a default or Event of Default relating to the applicable series of
Notes, or, if applicable, the Issuers’ obligations with respect to the applicable series of Notes
will be discharged. These conditions are:

   - An Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee or, at
the option of the Trustee, with a trustee satisfactory to the Trustee and an Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee, funds or governmental obligations or a
combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of certified
public accountants, to pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding
securities of such series to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and to pay all
other amounts payable by it hereunder, provided that (A) the Trustee of the irrevocable
trust shall have been irrevocably instructed to pay such funds or the proceeds of such
governmental obligations to the Trustee and (B) the Trustee shall have been irrevocably
instructed to apply such funds or the proceeds of such governmental obligations to the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the securities of such
series;

153


-----

   - An Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor delivers to the Trustee an officer’s certificate stating
that all conditions precedent specified herein relating to defeasance or covenant
defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with, and an opinion of counsel to
the same effect;

   - No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become such an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, on the date of such deposit;

   - An Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel or a ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the
holders of the securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Issuer’s or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s exercise
of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. Federal income
tax in the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such election had not been exercised;

   - such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not (i) cause the Trustee to have a
conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any securities
or (ii) result in the trust arising from such deposit to constitute, unless it is registered as
such, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

   - such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any
additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on an
Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the applicable Indenture.

**Additional Notes**

We may, without the consent of the then existing holders of the Notes of a series, “re-open”
the series and issue additional notes, which additional notes will have the same terms as the
Notes offered hereby except for the issue price, issue date and under some circumstances, the
first interest payment date. Additional notes issued in this manner will form a single series with
the applicable series of the Notes offered hereby. We may also issue additional notes of a new
series. All additional notes issued under the Indentures will be considered “Notes” for purposes
thereof, with such changes as the context may imply.

**Optional Redemption**

**_2024 Notes_**

The 2024 Notes will be subject to redemption at the Issuers’ option on any date prior to the
maturity date, in whole or from time to time in part, in $1,000 increments (provided that any
remaining principal amount thereof shall be at least the minimum authorized denomination
thereof). The 2024 Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by the
Quotation Agent and delivered to the Trustee in writing, the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon due on any date after the date
of redemption (excluding the portion of interest that will be accrued and unpaid to and including
the date of redemption) discounted from their scheduled date of payment to the date of
redemption (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted
Redemption Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon
to the date of redemption.

154

**_2026 Notes_**

thereof). The 2026 Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by the
Quotation Agent and delivered to the Trustee in writing, the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon due on any date after the date
of redemption (excluding the portion of interest that will be accrued and unpaid to and including
the date of redemption) discounted from their scheduled date of payment to the date of
redemption (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted
Redemption Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon
to the date of redemption.

**_Optional Redemption Definitions_**

“Adjusted Redemption Treasury Rate,” with respect to any date of redemption, means the
rate equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a 30/360 day count
basis) yield to maturity of the Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the
Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount)
equal to the Comparable Redemption Treasury Price for such date of redemption.

“Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security
selected by the Quotation Agent as being the most recently issued United States Treasury note
or bond as displayed by Bloomberg LP (or any successor service) on screens PXI through PX8
(or any other screens as may replace such screens on such service) that has a remaining term
comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed.

“Comparable Redemption Treasury Price,” with respect to any date of redemption, means
(i) the average of the Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of
redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations (unless there is more than one highest or lowest quotation, in which case only one
such highest and/or lowest quotation shall be excluded), or (ii) if the Quotation Agent obtains
fewer than four such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such
Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.

“Quotation Agent” means a Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer appointed as such
agent by the Issuers.

155


-----

**Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes**

The Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes under the following
conditions:

   - If there is an amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of Switzerland or the
United States, as applicable, or any political subdivision thereof or therein having the
power to tax (a “Taxing Jurisdiction”), or any change in the application or official
interpretation of such laws, including any action taken by a taxing authority or a holding
by a court of competent jurisdiction, regardless of whether such action or such holding
is with respect to an Issuer;

   - As a result of such amendment or change, an Issuer becomes, or there is a material
probability that an Issuer will become, obligated to pay Additional Amounts, as defined
below in “Payment of Additional Amounts,” on the next payment date with respect to
debt securities of such series;

   - The obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided through an Issuer’s
commercially reasonable measures;

   - An Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

     - a certificate of such Issuer stating that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
cannot be avoided by such Issuer taking commercially reasonable measures
available to it; and

     - a written opinion of independent legal counsel to such Issuer of recognized standing
to the effect that such Issuer has, or there is a material probability that it will become
obligated, to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a change, amendment, official
interpretation or application described above and that such Issuer cannot avoid the
payment of such Additional Amounts by taking commercially reasonable measures
available to it; and

     - following the delivery of the certificate and opinion described in the previous bullet
point, such Issuer provides notice of redemption not less than 30 days, but not more
than 90 days, prior to the date of redemption. The notice of redemption cannot be
given more than 90 days before the earliest date on which such Issuer would be
otherwise required to pay Additional Amounts, and the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts must still be in effect when the notice is given.

Upon the occurrence of each of the bullet points above, the Issuers may redeem the debt
securities of such series at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

**Notice of Redemption**

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 90 days before
the redemption date to the Trustee and each holder of notes of a series to be redeemed. If the
Issuers elect to redeem a portion but not all of the Notes, the Trustee will select the Notes to be
redeemed in accordance with a method determined by the Issuers and the rules and procedures
of DTC, in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if
any.

Interest on such Notes or portions of Notes will cease to accrue on and after the date fixed
for redemption, unless the Issuers default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued
interest with respect to any such security or portion thereof.

156


-----

If any date of redemption of any security is not a Business Day, then payment of principal
and interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect
as if made on the nominal date of redemption and no interest will accrue for the period after
such nominal date.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

Unless otherwise required by law, an Issuer will not deduct or withhold from payments
made by such Issuer under or with respect to the guarantees on account of any present or
future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction (“Taxes”). In the event that an
Issuer is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any
payment made under or with respect to the Notes, such Issuer, will pay such additional
amounts (“Additional Amounts”) so that the net amount received by each holder of Notes
(including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that
such holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or
deducted.

Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to a payment made to a holder of
Notes or a holder of beneficial interests in global securities where such holder is subject to
taxation on such payment by a relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such
holder’s mere ownership of the securities or for or on account of:

   - any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a Person
holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:

   - is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or
business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the
Taxing Jurisdiction;

   - has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of
such securities) with the Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such taxes, including being or
having been a citizen or resident thereof or being treated as being or having been a
resident thereof;

   - with respect to any withholding taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with
respect to the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment
company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or
corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or
owns or owned 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
of an Issuer;

   - any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed
with respect to the securities, except as otherwise provided in the Indentures;

   - any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Notes, where
presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on
which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is
duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder
thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had such Notes
been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;

   - any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other Person to
comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting

157


-----

requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the
Taxing Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or
regulation of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption
from such Taxes;

   - with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes
imposed by reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of
sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code;

   - any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by an
Issuer or any paying agent from payments in respect of such securities;

   - any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of
any securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one
other paying agent;

   - any combination of the above conditions.

Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any holder of securities or
holder of a beneficial interest in such securities if such payment would not be subject to such
withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure of such holder or holder of a beneficial
interest in such securities to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for
exemption or to provide a certificate declaring its non-residence, if each Issuer were treated as a
domestic corporation under United States federal income tax and if (x) the making of such
declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is required or imposed by statute, treaty,
regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing authority as a precondition to
an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 90 days prior to the first
payment date with respect to which each Issuer shall apply this paragraph, each Issuer shall
have notified all holders of securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such
declaration or claim.

Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any holder of securities or the holder of a
beneficial interest in a global security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or
other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole holder of such security or
holder of such beneficial interests of such security, as the case may be. The exception, however,
will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a
beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally
transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had
the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or
distributive share of the payment.

In addition, no Additional Amounts will be paid on account of any taxes imposed or
withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated
thereunder or official interpretations thereof.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes
of a series is due and payable, if an Issuer will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such payment, such Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an officer’s certificate stating the
fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other
information as is necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of
such Notes on the payment date.

The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination or the discharge of an Indenture and
shall apply to any jurisdiction in which an Issuer or any successor to such Issuer is organized or

158


-----

is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in this “Description of First-Priority Notes” there is mentioned, in any context,
the payment of principal, premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount
payable under or with respect to the Notes, such mention includes the payment of Additional
Amounts to the extent payable in the particular context.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuers have
exercised their option to redeem the Notes, the Issuers shall be required to make an offer (a
“Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of the Notes to repurchase, at the holder’s election,
all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that
holder’s Notes on the terms set forth in the applicable Indenture. In a Change of Control Offer,
the Issuers shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
repurchased to the date of repurchase (a “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days
following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuers’ option, prior to any Change
of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute
the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to the Trustee and to the holders of the Notes
describing in reasonable detail the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of
Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the
notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed (a “Change of Control Payment Date”). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the
date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned
on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date.

Any exercise by a holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be
irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal
amount of a note, but in that event the principal amount of such note remaining outstanding
after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuers shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of
a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by it and the third
party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the
Issuers shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of
Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the applicable Indenture, other than a default in
the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes.

For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the following terms
are applicable:

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of either of the following: (1) the sale, lease or

### CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Unsecured Notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S.
Holders (each as defined below and collectively referred to as “Holders”) of the Unsecured
Notes. The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury regulations, rulings, administrative
pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change
or differing interpretations at any time with possible retroactive effect. We have not requested,
and do not intend to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect
to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result no
assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or
that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all of the possible tax consequences
of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Unsecured Notes and does not address all
tax consequences that might be relevant to particular Holders in light of their personal
circumstances. In particular, this summary deals only with Holders that acquire the Unsecured
Notes pursuant to this offering at the issue price set forth on the cover of this information
memorandum and will hold the Unsecured Notes as “capital assets” (generally, property held
for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not include
any description of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. government that may be
applicable to a particular Holder and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other
than income taxation. This summary does not address U.S. federal alternative minimum tax
consequences. In addition, this summary does not apply to Holders that may be subject to
special tax rules, such as dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies, financial
institutions, mutual funds or “financial services entities,” banks, thrifts, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, expatriates, tax-exempt entities,
entities or arrangements treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as partnerships,
S-corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings
to avoid U.S. federal income tax, retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts, persons that
hold Unsecured Notes as a part of a hedge, straddle, conversion transaction, constructive sale
or other arrangement involving more than one position, U.S. expatriates, persons that are
required to report income no later than when such income is reported in an “applicable financial
statement” and investors who receive Unsecured Notes as compensation. This summary also
does not address tax consequences to Holders (as defined below) as a result of using a
“functional currency” that is not the U.S. dollar.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of the Unsecured
Notes that is: (a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal
income tax purposes; (b) a corporation (or other business entity treated as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or
any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (c) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S.
federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d) a trust (A) if a court within the United
States can exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (B) that has a valid election in
effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Unsecured
Notes that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust
and is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes).

170


-----

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Unsecured
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or other owner of the entity will generally depend upon
the status of the partner or other owner and the activities of the entity. A partner in or other
owner of such an entity is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of
acquiring, owning and disposing of the Unsecured Notes.

**The discussion set out below is intended only as a summary of certain U.S.**
**federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of**
**the Unsecured Notes. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax**
**consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Unsecured Notes,**
**including the application to their particular situation of the tax consequences**
**discussed below, as well as the application of other federal tax laws and state, local**
**or non-U.S. tax laws. The discussion set out below is based on the laws and**
**regulations in force and interpretations thereof as of the date hereof, and are subject**
**to changes occurring after the date hereof.**

**Unsecured Notes Subject to Contingencies**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Unsecured Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), we may be obligated to
pay Holders additional amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Unsecured
Notes. It is possible that our obligation to make additional payments on the Unsecured Notes
could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt
instruments.” If the Unsecured Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt
instruments, Holders might, among other things, be required to accrue interest income at a
higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Unsecured Notes and to treat any gain
recognized on the sale or other disposition of an Unsecured Note as ordinary income rather
than as capital gain.

We intend to take the position that the likelihood of additional payments on the Unsecured
Notes is remote, and thus, that the Unsecured Notes should not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. Our determination that these contingencies are remote is binding on
a Holder unless it discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury
regulations. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to
challenge this determination, a Holder might be required to include in gross income an amount
of ordinary interest income on the Unsecured Notes in excess of the stated interest, and a
Holder might be required to treat income realized on the taxable disposition of an Unsecured
Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain. In the event a contingency occurs, it would
affect the amount and timing of income recognized by a Holder. If any contingent amounts are
in fact paid, a Holder will be required to recognize such amounts as income.

The remainder of this disclosure assumes that our determination that the contingencies are
remote is correct. The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments
have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the
Treasury regulations is not certain. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Unsecured Notes.

**Tax Consequences for U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Each payment of qualified stated interest on an Unsecured Note (including any amount
withheld as backup withholding tax) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
interest income at the time it accrues or is received, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

_General_

An Unsecured Note with a term that exceeds one year will be treated as issued with original
issue discount (“OID”) if the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Unsecured Note
exceeds its “issue price” by more than the de minimis amount (such amount, “de minimis
OID”) of less than [1]⁄4 of 1 percent of the “stated redemption price at maturity” multiplied by the
number of complete years to maturity from the issue date. The “stated redemption price at
maturity” of the Unsecured Notes may exceed the “issue price” of the Unsecured Notes by
more than a de minimis amount, in which case, the Unsecured Notes will therefore constitute
discount notes issued with OID. Following is a summary of the OID rules and their application to
the Unsecured Notes.

If a substantial amount of Unsecured Notes in an issue is issued for money, the “issue
price” of an Unsecured Note in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Unsecured Notes is sold for money (ignoring sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). A U.S. Holder may
obtain the issue price of an Unsecured Note by contacting us at the address set forth under
“Summary—Overview.” The “stated redemption price at maturity” of an Unsecured Note
generally is the sum of all payments provided by the Unsecured Note other than “qualified
stated interest” payments. Generally, an interest payment on an Unsecured Note is “qualified
stated interest” if it is one of a series of stated interest payments on an Unsecured Note that are
unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate, with certain exceptions for lower
rates paid during some periods, applied to the outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured
Note. Interest is considered unconditionally payable only if reasonable legal remedies exist to
compel timely payment or the Unsecured Note otherwise provides terms and conditions that
make the likelihood of late payment (other than a late payment that occurs within a reasonable
grace period) or non-payment a remote contingency. Interest is payable at a single fixed rate
only if the rate appropriately takes into account the length of the interval between payments.
Thus, if the interval between payments varies during the term of an Unsecured Note, the value
of the fixed rate on which a payment is based generally must be adjusted to reflect a
compounding assumption consistent with the length of the interval preceding the payment.

Unsecured Notes that have de minimis OID generally will be treated as not having OID
unless a U.S. Holder elects to treat all interest on the Unsecured Note as OID. See “—Election to
Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method).”

Because the Unsecured Notes may be issued with OID, a U.S. Holder may be required to
include OID in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues (regardless of its
method of accounting), which may be in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to that
income. OID accrues under the constant yield method, based on a compounded yield to
maturity, as described below. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to include
in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.

The annual amounts of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder will equal the sum of the
“daily portions” of the OID with respect to an Unsecured Note for each day on which such U.S.
Holder owns the Unsecured Note during the taxable year. Generally, a U.S. Holder determines
the daily portions of OID by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of
the OID that is allocable to that accrual period. The term “accrual period” means an interval of
time with respect to which the accrual of OID is measured and which may vary in length over
the term of an Unsecured Note provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and
each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on either the first or last day of an
accrual period.

172


-----

The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will be the excess of (i) the product of
(x) the “adjusted issue price” of the Unsecured Note at the beginning of the accrual period and
(y) its “yield to maturity” over (ii) the aggregate amount of any qualified stated interest
payments allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of an Unsecured Note at the
beginning of the first accrual period is its issue price, and, on any day thereafter, it is the sum of
the issue price and the amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any holder,
reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest)
previously made on the Unsecured Note. If an interval between payments of qualified stated
interest on an Unsecured Note contains more than one accrual period, then, when a U.S. Holder
determines the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period, such U.S. Holder must allocate the
amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval, including any qualified
stated interest that is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately following the
interval, pro rata to each accrual period in the interval. In addition, a U.S. Holder must increase
the adjusted issue price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval by the amount of
any qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the first day of the accrual period but that
is not payable until the end of the interval. If all accrual periods are of equal length except for
either an initial shorter accrual period or an initial and a final shorter accrual period, a U.S.
Holder can compute the amount of OID allocable to the initial accrual period using any
reasonable method; however, the OID allocable to the final accrual period will always be the
difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated
interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period.

_Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method)_
A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on its
Unsecured Note using the constant yield method described above under “—General,” with the
modifications described below. For purposes of this election, interest will include qualified
stated interest, OID, de minimis OID and unstated interest. If a U.S. Holder make this election for
its Unsecured Note, then, when such U.S. Holder applies the constant yield method: the issue
price of its Unsecured Note will equal its cost; the issue date of such U.S. Holder’s Note will be
the date such U.S. Holder acquired it; and no payments on the Unsecured Note will be treated
as payments of qualified stated interest. Generally, this election will apply only to the
Unsecured Note for which a U.S. Holder makes it. A U.S. Holder may not revoke an election to
apply the constant yield method to all interest on an Unsecured Note without the consent of the
IRS.

**_Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the Unsecured Notes_**

Upon the sale, retirement or other disposition of an Unsecured Note, a U.S. Holder will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of cash plus the
fair market value of any property received (other than any amounts allocated to accrued but
unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent not
previously so taxed) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Unsecured Note. A U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Unsecured Note will generally be equal to the cost of the
Unsecured Note, increased by the amount of any OID previously include in income and
decreased by any payment previously received other than qualified stated interest payments.
Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Unsecured Notes exceeds one year at the time of the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Unsecured Note. If the holding period
for the Unsecured Note is one year or less at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of the Unsecured Note, any capital gain or loss generally will be treated as
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S.
Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

173


-----

**_Additional Tax on Passive Income_**

Certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds
certain thresholds are required to pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on, among other things,
interest income and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of notes, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
effect, if any, of this tax on their ownership and disposition of the Unsecured Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of principal
of, and interest and accruals of OID on, or Unsecured Note, and any proceeds of the disposition
of or Unsecured Note before maturity, to a U.S. Holder other than certain exempt recipients,
such as corporations. A U.S. Holder may also be subject to backup withholding (currently at the
rate of 24%) with respect to payments of interest and the gross proceeds received pursuant to a
disposition unless the U.S. Holder is (i) a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when
required, establishes this exemption or (ii) provides its correct taxpayer identification number,
certifies that it is not currently subject to backup withholding tax and otherwise complies with
applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules. A U.S. Holder that does not
provide its correct taxpayer identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the
IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against the U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided, that the required information is
furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding the application of backup withholding to their particular situation, the availability of
an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if
available.

**Tax Consequences for Non-U.S. Holders**

_Payments of Interest_

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding (“—Information Reporting
and Backup Withholding”) and any application of FATCA (as defined below, “—FATCA”),
payments of interest on or Unsecured Note (including OID) to a Non-U.S. Holder that are not
effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
United States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or any withholding tax, if:

   - such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our
voting stock;

   - such Non-U.S. Holder is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a controlled foreign
corporation related, directly or indirectly, to us through stock ownership under
applicable rules of the Code;

   - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
the Code; and

   - the certification requirement, as described below, is fulfilled with respect to the
beneficial owner of the Unsecured Note.

The certification requirement referred to above will be fulfilled if either (A) a Non-U.S.
Holder provides to us or our paying agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or
successor form), signed under penalties of perjury, that includes its name and address and a
certification as to its non-U.S. status, or (B) a securities clearing organization, bank or other

174


-----

financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of its trade or
business holds the Unsecured Note on behalf of the beneficial owner and provides a statement
to us or our paying agent, signed under penalties of perjury, in which the organization, bank or
financial institution certifies that it has received an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or
successor form) from the non-U.S. beneficial owner or from another financial institution acting
on behalf of such beneficial owner and furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof and
otherwise complies with the applicable IRS requirements. Other methods might be available to
satisfy the certification requirements described above, depending on the Non-U.S. Holder’s
particular circumstances.

The gross amount of payments of interest that do not qualify for the exception from
withholding described above (the “portfolio interest exemption”) will be subject to U.S.
withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless (A) a Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under an applicable tax treaty, or (B) such interest is effectively
connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States
and such Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form).

**_Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_**

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and if interest on
the Unsecured Note or gain realized on the disposition of the Unsecured Note is effectively
connected with the conduct of such trade or business, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be
subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the interest or gain on a net basis in the same
manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an applicable treaty provides
otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may
also be subject to a branch profits tax on its earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to
certain adjustments, at a rate of 30% unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty.
Even though such effectively connected income is subject to income tax, and may be subject to
the branch profits tax, it is not subject to withholding tax if such Non-U.S. Holder satisfies the
certification requirements described above.

**_Sale, Exchange or Disposition of the Unsecured Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and any application of
FATCA (as defined below), a Non-U.S. Holder of an Unsecured Note generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable
disposition of such Note (other than gain that represents accrued but unpaid interest not
previously included in income, in which case the rules regarding interest would apply) unless:

   - such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or

   - such gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or
business within the United States.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Unless certain exceptions apply, we must report annually to the IRS and to any Non-U.S.
Holder any interest paid to such Non-U.S. Holder during the taxable year. Copies of these
information returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or
other agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides.

175


-----

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, backup withholding tax will not apply to
payments of interest by us or our paying agent on an Unsecured Note if the certifications
described above under “—Payments of Interest” are received, provided that we or our paying
agent, as the case may be, do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the payee is a
U.S. person.

The gross proceeds from a sale, exchange or other disposition of an Unsecured Note by a
Non-U.S. Holder made to or through a foreign office of a foreign broker generally will not be
subject to backup withholding or information reporting. However, if such broker is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes: a U.S. person; a controlled foreign corporation; a foreign person
50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business for a
specified three-year period; or a foreign partnership with certain connections to the United
States, then information reporting will be required unless the broker has in its records
documentary evidence that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. person and certain other
conditions are met or the beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup
withholding at the applicable rate, currently 24%, may apply to any payment that such broker is
required to report if the broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the payee is a U.S.
person. Payments to or through the U.S. office of a broker will be subject to backup withholding
and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies, under penalties of perjury, that
it is not a U.S. person, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. A Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund or a credit against such Non-U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders are
urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting
and backup withholding rules in their particular situations, the availability of an exemption
therefrom, and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**_FATCA. Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial_**
institutions (which include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds,
securitization vehicles and any other investment vehicles) and certain other foreign entities
must comply with information reporting rules with respect to their U.S. account holders and
investors or confront a withholding tax on U.S. source payments made to them (whether
received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). More specifically, a
foreign financial institution or other foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA
reporting requirements will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any
“withholdable payments.” For this purpose, withholdable payments include generally U.S.source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source interest)
and, subject to the following two sentences, also include the entire gross proceeds from the sale
or other disposition of any debt instruments of U.S. issuers. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would
eliminate the U.S. federal withholding tax applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or
disposition of debt instruments. In its preamble to the proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury
stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are
issued.

**Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the effect**
**of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax laws, as well as treaties, with**
**regard** **to** **an** **investment** **in** **the** **Unsecured** **Notes,** **including** **any** **reporting**

### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

The Unsecured Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold to persons reasonably
believed to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). Unsecured Notes offered
hereby also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
(“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, Unsecured Notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of
$1,000. Unsecured Notes offered hereby will be issued at the closing of this offering only
against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more notes in registered, global
form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes
initially will be represented by one or more temporary notes in registered, global form without
interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”). The global notes
will be deposited upon issuance with the trustee as custodian for DTC, in New York, New York,
and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a
direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Through and including the 40th day
after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period
through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”), beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear System
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, _société_ _anonyme_ (“Clearstream”) (as indirect
participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A
Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. After the
expiration of the Restricted Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged
for one or more permanent notes in registered, global form without interest coupons
(collectively, the “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”; the Regulation S Global Notes and
the Rule 144A Global Notes collectively being the “Global Notes”) upon delivery to the trustee
of certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Unsecured Notes
and pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes.
Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described
below. See “—Exchanges between Regulation S notes and Rule 144A notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part,
only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in
the Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes.”
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes (as defined
herein).

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be
subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under
“Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants
(including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to
time.

Initially, the trustee will act as paying agent and registrar. The Unsecured Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar.

**Certain Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures
are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to change by
them from time to time. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge
investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities
for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance
and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access
to DTC’s system is also available to other entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either
directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).

Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of
DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and
transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on
the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, (i) upon deposit of
the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial
purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes and (ii) ownership of such
interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the
Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if they
are Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) which are Participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note, including
those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and
requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be
subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require
that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be
limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on
behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of a person having beneficial
interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate
in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the
lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Unsecured
Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Unsecured Notes in
certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under
the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the
registered holder under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes. Under the terms of the

178


-----

indenture governing the Unsecured Notes, we and the trustee will treat the persons in whose
names the Unsecured Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners thereof
for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever.
Consequently, neither we, the trustee nor any of our or the trustee’s agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest
in the Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any
Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the
Global Notes or (ii) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its
Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of
any payment in respect of securities, such as the Unsecured Notes (including principal and
interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment
date, in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal amount of beneficial
interest in the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC unless DTC has reason to
believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Payments by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Unsecured Notes will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the
Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or us. Neither we nor
the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants or indirect Participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of the Unsecured Notes, and we and the trustee may
conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for
all purposes.

Except for trades involving Euroclear and Clearstream participants, interests in the Global
Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and
secondary market trading activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately
available funds, subject in all cases to the rules and procedures of DTC and its Participants. See
“—Same-Day Settlement and Payment.” Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under
“Notice to Investors,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with
DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their
respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Unsecured Notes
described herein, crossmarket transfers between the Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and
Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in
accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its
respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system
in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels
time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction
meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action
to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global
Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream
participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or
Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Unsecured Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has
credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Unsecured Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or

179


-----

have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture
governing the Unsecured Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
legended Unsecured Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Unsecured Notes to its
Participants.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and
in the Rule 144A Global Notes among Participants in DTC, and such procedures may be
discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our or their respective agents
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive Unsecured Notes in registered certificated
form (“Certificated Notes”) if (i) DTC (x) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depositary for the Global Notes and we thereupon fail to appoint a successor depositary or
(y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, or (ii) there shall have
occurred and be continuing a default or event of default with respect to the Unsecured Notes. In
addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon
request but only upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in
accordance with the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes, and in accordance with the
certification requirements set forth in the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes. In all cases,
Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests therein will
be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on
behalf of DTC (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable
restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors,” unless we determine otherwise in
compliance with applicable law.

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such
exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to Rule 144A
and the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture governing the Unsecured Notes) to the effect that the Unsecured Notes are being
transferred to a person who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional
buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A, purchasing for its own account or the account of a
qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in
accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after
the expiration of the Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written
certificate (in the form provided in the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes) to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144
(if available).

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for
a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa will be effected in DTC by means of
an instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system.
Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to

180


-----

reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding
increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in
such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial
interest in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note
prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the
indenture certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary
Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased such interest in a
transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the trustee (or the paying agent if
other than the trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture, prior to any exchange
of such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same-Day Settlement and Payment**

Payments in respect of the Unsecured Notes represented by the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note holder. With respect to any Unsecured Notes
in certificated form, we will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof or,
if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The
Unsecured Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in
such Unsecured Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available
funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited,
and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear
and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that
cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant in DTC will be received with
value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following
DTC’s settlement date.

### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) among the Issuers, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Barclays
Capital Inc., as representatives of the several initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the
initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not
jointly, all of the Unsecured Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for
and accept delivery of the Unsecured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery
of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The initial purchasers have agreed to resell the Unsecured Notes (a) in the United States to
persons who they reasonably believe are QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and (b) outside the
United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S, in
each case, under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The Unsecured Notes will
initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the
Unsecured Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Unsecured Notes may from
time to time be varied by the initial purchasers. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject
an order of Unsecured Notes in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments
that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, issue,
contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any dollar-denominated debt securities issued or
guaranteed by us and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of such debt securities, or
publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, issuance, pledge or disposition,
other than the First-Priority Notes, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. on behalf of the initial purchasers, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering
memorandum.

The offer and sale of Unsecured Notes have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act and the Unsecured Notes may not be offered or sold except as set forth above.
Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the Unsecured Notes. As a result, we
cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Unsecured Notes will sell in the market
after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market
for the Unsecured Notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. We do not
intend to apply for listing of the Unsecured Notes on any national securities exchange or for
inclusion of the Unsecured Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial
purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Unsecured Notes
as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Unsecured Notes and any such market making may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, marketmaking activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
Unsecured Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Unsecured Notes will be made against payment therefor on
or about, 2019 which will be the business day following the date of pricing of
the Unsecured Notes, or “T+ .” Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the

185


-----

secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Unsecured
Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Unsecured Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of
Unsecured Notes who wish to trade Unsecured Notes on the date of pricing or the next
succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that
they will not offer, sell or deliver the Unsecured Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United
States persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after
the closing of the offering. The initial purchasers will send to any dealer to whom they sell
Unsecured Notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions
on offers and sales of the Unsecured Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, United States persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area (“EEA”)**

The Unsecured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA.
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance
Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the
“Prospectus Directive”).

Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering
or selling the Unsecured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Unsecured Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.
This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Unsecured Notes
in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Unsecured Notes. This
offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Market Act 200 (the
“FSMA”)) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Unsecured Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us; and

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect
to anything done by it in relation to such Unsecured Notes in, from or otherwise
involving the United Kingdom.

186

This offering memorandum does not constitute an issue prospectus pursuant to Article
652a or Article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Unsecured Notes will not be listed
on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Therefore, this offering memorandum may not comply with the
disclosure standards of the listing rules (including any additional listing rules or prospectus
schemes) of the SIX Swiss Exchange. Accordingly, the Unsecured Notes may not be offered to
the public in or from Switzerland, but only to a selected and limited circle of investors who do
not subscribe to the Unsecured Notes with a view to distribution. Any such investors will be
individually approached by the initial purchasers from time to time.

Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Unsecured Notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser
with remedies for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any
amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or
damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities
legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the
government of a non-Canadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105
Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not required to comply with the
disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection
with this offering.

**Stabilization**

In connection with the offering, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Unsecured Notes.

187


-----

Specifically, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase Unsecured Notes in the open
markets to stabilize the price of the Unsecured Notes. The initial purchasers may also overallot
the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Unsecured Notes
in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may
bid for and purchase Unsecured Notes in market making transactions and impose penalty bids.
These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Unsecured Notes
above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The initial purchasers are not required to
engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates from time to time has provided in
the past and may provide in the future investment banking, commercial lending and financial
advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have
received, or may in the future receive, customary fees, expenses and commissions. In the
ordinary course of its various business activities, the initial purchasers or one of their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for
its own account and for the accounts of its customers, and such investment and securities
activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers and/or Company. The initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and
may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

An affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. acts as administrative agent under the First Lien Credit
Agreement and certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders,
agents and/or arrangers under the First Lien Credit Agreement and, as consideration therefor,
have received or will receive customary fees and expenses in connection with the First Lien
Credit Agreement (including in connection with the Credit Agreement Amendment). Certain of
the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may hold loans under the First Lien Term
Facility, and therefore such initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the
proceeds of this offering that are being used to prepay a portion of the First Lien Term Facility.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and/or its affiliate will act as dealer manager in connection with
the Tender Offer. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may hold the
Prime Notes, and to the extent such notes are repurchased pursuant to the Tender Offer or
redeemed pursuant to the Redemption, such initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a
portion of the proceeds of this offering that are being used to repurchase and/or redeem the
