**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

We include statements regarding market share and ranking and factors that have impacted our
industry. Such statements are statements of belief and are based on industry data and forecasts that we
have obtained from industry publications and surveys, as well as from internal company sources and our
management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate. Industry publications,
surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of
such information. Neither we nor the initial purchasers have independently verified any of the data from
third-party sources, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. In
addition, while we believe that the industry information included herein is generally reliable as of the dates
thereof, such information is inherently imprecise. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding
the industry data presented herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to
change based on various factors described in this offering memorandum under the heading “Risk
Factors” and as disclosed in Item 1A of the 2020 Annual Report (as defined herein) and the other
information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. These factors could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these publications. Accordingly, investors
should not place undue weight on the industry, ranking and market data presented in this offering
memorandum.

**NO SEC REVIEW**

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities**
**commission has approved or disapproved of the Notes or determined if this offering**
**memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information that would
be required if this offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. This offering
memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed by the
SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer notes
in a transaction registered under the Securities Act in exchange for the Notes or to file a registration
statement with respect to the Notes. The indenture governing the Notes will not be qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”).

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

To provide to holders of the Notes additional information in connection with our results as
determined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we
disclose Adjusted EBITDA, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC), Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free
Cash Flow as non-GAAP measures. These measures are not financial measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income,
cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional
information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine
items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not
core to our operations. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating
profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and
comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii)
depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets

iv


-----

and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred
revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) merger,
restructuring, integration, and other, (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs,
net, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments,
and (xii) other charges and non-cash items.

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into
account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other
adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by
considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted
EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Adjusted
EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted
EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.

**Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC)**

We believe that the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) is appropriate to
provide additional information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted to exclude the effect
of our subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”). Additionally, we present Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (PreSAC), which is used in the indentures governing our First Lien Credit Agreement and our Second-Priority
Notes, as a supplemental measure of our performance and ability to service debt and incur additional
debt.

We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our
statement of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the
sale of equipment (expensed net SAC).

There are material limitations to using Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Covenant Adjusted
EBITDA (Pre-SAC) does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and
amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs, which directly
affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of
the excluded items independently, and by considering Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in
conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**Free Cash Flow**

We believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional
information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to
capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include accounts purchased through our network
of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network; subscriber system asset
expenditures; and purchases of property and equipment. These items are subtracted from cash flows
from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal
business activities.

Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to
direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable
GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary
expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not
deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash
flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

v


-----

**Adjusted Free Cash Flow**

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional
information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to (i) net
cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, (ii) financing and consent fees, (iii)
restructuring and integration, (iv) integration related capital expenditures, (v) radio conversion costs, and
(vi) other payments or receipts that may mask our operating results or business trends. As a result,
subject to the limitations described below, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash flow
attributable to our normal business activities, inclusive of the net cash flows associated with the
acquisition of subscribers, as well as our ability to repay other debt, make other investments, and pay
dividends.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s
discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the
most comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash
flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary
expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Adjusted Free Cash Flow
in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.

During the second quarter of 2020, Free Cash Flow before special items was renamed Adjusted
Free Cash Flow to reflect the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, which
supports our consumer financing program that launched nationally in 2020. The inclusion of the net cash
flow associated with our consumer receivables facility represents the only revision to Free Cash Flow
before special items.

subsequent to March 31, 2021.

(2) Represents the $1,000 million face value of the Notes (excluding original issue discount (if any)) prior to the initial
purchasers’ discount to the offering price. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together
with cash on hand, to (a) redeem in full the $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022
ADT Notes and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Description of
Notes.”

Assumes that the Issuer will redeem $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 ADT
Notes on August 28, 2021(with payment of the redemption price to take place on August 30, 2021, which is the
first business day after the redemption date), and pay all accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable
redemption premium on such 2022 ADT Notes to, but excluding, such date, in accordance with the indenture
governing the 2022 ADT Notes, which we expect will amount to approximately $31 million. The 2022 ADT Notes
have a maturity date of July 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 3.500% per annum. Prior to July 15, 2022, the
Issuer may redeem the 2022 ADT Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 ADT Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole
premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

and the Redemption, including breakage costs, placement and other financing fees, advisory fees and other
transaction costs and professional fees, including any initial purchasers’ commissions in connection with the
offering of the Notes. We intend to pay all fees and expenses associated with the Transactions with cash on
hand.

**Recent Developments**

On July 2, 2021, we amended our First Lien Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of our
existing first lien revolving credit facility (as extended, the “Extended First Lien Revolving Credit
Facility”) to June 23, 2026, subject to the repayment, extension, or refinancing with longer maturity debt of
certain of Prime Borrower’s other indebtedness, and obtain an additional $175 million of commitments
under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.

**The Offering**

The summary below describes the principal terms of the Notes offered hereby. Certain of the
terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. You should
carefully review the “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum, which contains a more
detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Notes.

Issuer................................................ The ADT Security Corporation

Notes Offered .................................... $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of   % FirstPriority Senior Secured Notes due 2029.

Maturity Date ..................................... August 1, 2029.

Interest Rates and Payment Dates...... The Notes will bear interest at a rate of   % per annum from
, 2021. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning
on February 1, 2022.

Denominations .................................. Minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

Guarantees ....................................... The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a
first-priority senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by
Prime Borrower and each of the present and future direct or
indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries of Prime
Borrower, other than the Issuer, that guarantees the First Lien
Credit Agreement. The guarantees will be automatically
released upon release of the corresponding guarantees of the
First Lien Credit Agreement (except a release by or as a
result of payment under such guarantee following a default by
the direct obligor of the First Lien Credit Agreement).
However, any such released guarantees will be reinstated if
the released guarantors are required to subsequently
guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement.

Ranking ............................................ The Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s
senior secured obligations and will:

                               - rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and
future senior obligations;

                               - rank senior in right of payment to all of our future debt and
other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

                               - be effectively senior to all of our future unsecured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing the Notes;

                               - be equal to all of our existing and future indebtedness that
is secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis,
including indebtedness under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, to


-----

the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
indebtedness;

                               - be effectively senior to all of our existing and future
indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a juniorpriority basis, including the Second-Priority Notes, to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes;
and

                               - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of
Prime Borrower’s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of
the Notes, including our special purpose subsidiaries.

As of the date hereof, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, the Notes would have ranked (i)
effectively pari passu with $7,329 million face value of
indebtedness drawn under the First Lien Credit Agreement,
the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, with a further
$575 million available for borrowing under the Revolving
Credit Facility, without giving effect to the letters of credit, and
(ii) effectively senior to the Second-Priority Notes to the extent
of the value of the collateral securing the Notes. See
“Description of Notes—Ranking.”

As of March 31, 2021, the non-recourse indebtedness of our
special purpose subsidiaries to which the Notes would be
effectively subordinated was $98 million.

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries held
approximately 1% of our consolidated assets, with less than
1% of our consolidated total assets attributable to special
purpose subsidiaries, and had $98 million of outstanding
indebtedness under our Receivables Facility (as defined
herein), consisting of non-recourse indebtedness of our
special purpose subsidiaries. During the three months ended
March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries generated less than
1% of our total revenue and less than 1% of our Adjusted
EBITDA.

Security............................................. The Notes and the related guarantees will be secured by firstpriority security interests in the collateral (which generally
includes substantially all of the existing and future assets of
the Issuer and the guarantors) subject to permitted liens and
certain exclusions as described herein.

The collateral securing the Notes will exclude: (i) certain real
property, (ii) motor vehicles, and certain commercial tort
claims, (iii) those assets over which the pledging or granting
of security interests in such assets would be prohibited by
applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual
obligations (including leases, licenses or other agreements,
government licenses or state or local license, franchises,
charters or authorizations (in each case, except to the extent
such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to
applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the


-----

Uniform Commercial Code), (iv) assets to the extent a
security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected
to result in material adverse tax consequences as determined
in good faith by Prime Borrower, (v) “intent-to-use” trademark
applications until an Amendment to Allege Use or Statement
of Use has been filed, (vi) certain securitization assets, (vii)
exceptions mutually agreed upon between Prime Borrower
and the administrative agent under the First Lien Credit
Agreement and (viii) certain other limited assets.

For more information on the security granted, see
“Description of Notes—Security.” The security interests in the
assets securing the Notes may be released under certain
circumstances without your consent or the consent of the
trustee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes” and “Description of Notes—
Release of Collateral.”

Intercreditor Agreement...................... The security granted in the collateral to secure the Notes on a
first-priority basis also secures, on a first-priority basis,
indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT
Notes and the First-Priority Notes. In addition, the indenture
governing the Notes will permit us to secure additional
indebtedness with liens on the collateral under certain
circumstances.

Pursuant to an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien/First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) to be joined by the Trustee on
the Issue Date, the lenders under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the holders of the ADT Notes, the holders of the
First-Priority Notes and the holders of certain other debt
(including certain hedging and cash management
counterparties) will receive parity treatment with the Notes
with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the security
interest in or other recoveries from the collateral. See
“Description of Notes—Security— First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Notes will also be subject to an intercreditor agreement
(the “First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) that
establishes the subordination of the liens securing the
Second-Priority Notes to the liens securing the first-priority
lien obligations, including the Notes, and certain other matters
relating to the administration of security interests. See
“Description of Notes—First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.”

Optional Redemption ......................... The Notes will be subject to redemption at our option on any
date prior to the maturity date, in whole or from time to time in
part.

Prior to            , 2028 (twelve months prior to the
maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes will be
redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed
and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole”


-----

Redemption of Notes for
Tax Reasons .....................................

Change of Control Offer to
Repurchase.......................................


amount, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to,
but excluding, the Par Call Date.

On or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal
amount of any Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. See
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

We may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes upon the
occurrence of specified tax events described under
“Description of Notes— Redemption Upon Changes in
Withholding Taxes.”

If (a) a Change of Control as defined under “Description of
Notes—Change of Control” occurs and (b) the rating on the
Notes is lowered in respect of a Change of Control and the
Notes are rated below investment grade by two of three rating
agencies (which are Standard & Poor’s Financial Services
LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.,
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc.), the
Issuer must offer to repurchase the Notes at a repurchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”


Certain Covenants ............................. The indenture governing the Notes will include requirements
that will, among other things, restrict the ability of Prime
Borrower and its subsidiaries to:

                               - merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets;

                               - create liens on certain assets; and

                               - enter into sale-leaseback transactions.

These covenants will be subject to a number of important
qualifications and limitations. See “Description of Notes.”


Transfer Restrictions; No
Registration Rights ............................


The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Notes are
subject to certain restrictions on transfer and may not be
offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes
will not be entitled to any registration rights, and we will not be
required to complete a registered exchange offer or file a
shelf registration statement for resales of the Notes. We do
not intend to issue registered notes in exchange for the Notes
and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact
the transferability of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There are


-----

restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes
without registration or the filing of a prospectus under
applicable securities laws, and the Notes are not subject to
any future registration rights or obligations.”

Use of Proceeds ................................ We will use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes,
together with cash on hand, to (a) redeem $1,000 million
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 ADT
Notes and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection
with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

No Prior Market ................................. The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently
no public trading market. Although certain of the initial
purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a
market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may
discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market
for the Notes will develop or be maintained. We do not intend
to list or apply to list the Notes on any securities exchange or
for quotation through any automated quotation system. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes—Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by
the absence of an active trading market, and there is no
assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if
developed be maintained, for the Notes.”

Book-Entry Form ............................... The Notes will be issued in registered book-entry form
represented by one or more global notes to be deposited with
or on behalf of DTC or its nominee. Transfers of the Notes will
only be effected through facilities of DTC. Beneficial interests
in the global notes may not be exchanged for certificated
notes except in limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry;
Delivery and Form.”

Additional Notes ................................ From time to time, without notice to, or the consent of, the
holders of the Notes, the Issuer may issue other debt
securities under the indenture governing the Notes in addition
to the Notes, increase the principal amount of the Notes that
may be issued under the indenture governing the Notes and
issue additional Notes in the future. Any additional Notes
issued in this manner will have the same terms as the Notes
being offered by this offering memorandum but may be
offered at a different offering price or have a different issue
date, interest accrual date or initial interest payment date than
the Notes being offered by this offering memorandum. If
issued in this manner, these additional Notes will become part
of the same series as the Notes being offered by this offering
memorandum, including for purposes of voting, redemptions
and offers to purchase. If any additional Notes issued in this
manner are issued at a price that causes such additional
Notes to have more than a de minimis amount of “original
issue discount” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and regulations of the United States Department of Treasury
thereunder (the “Code”), such additional Notes may not have
the same CUSIP number as the Notes offered by this offering


-----

memorandum. The indenture governing the Notes also permit
the issuance of additional series of notes having different
terms than the Notes. Holders of additional notes issued in
this manner will vote with holders of the Notes (except to the
extent the amendment affects a provision that is included in
only one series of notes).

Trustee ............................................. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

Notes Collateral Agent ....................... Barclays Bank PLC.

Governing Law .................................. The governing law for the Notes and the indenture is New
York.

Risk Factors ...................................... You should carefully consider the information set forth herein
under “Risk Factors” and in the section entitled “Risk Factors”
in the 2020 Annual Report and the other information included
or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum in
deciding whether to purchase the Notes.

(1) In evaluating our results, we utilize key performance indicators which include non-GAAP measures as well as

certain other operating metrics such as recurring monthly revenue (“RMR”) and gross customer revenue attrition.
Our computations of key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. Additionally, our operating metric key performance indicators are approximated as
there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in
connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics
differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of
business. These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversions or historical
methodology differences in legacy systems.

(2) RMR is generated by contractual recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our
customers. We believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under
contract at a given point in time.

(3) A portion of our customer base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Customers may choose not to
renew or may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons, including relocation, cost, loss to competition, or
service issues. Gross customer revenue attrition has a direct impact on our financial results, including revenue,
operating income, and cash flows.
Gross customer revenue attrition is defined as RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer chargebacks and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and DIY customers. Customer
sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer
cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back
period, which is generally thirteen months.

Gross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the
RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding
contracts monitored but not owned and DIY customers, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR
based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.
As of January 1, 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of LifeShield LLC, we began presenting gross customer
revenue attrition excluding existing and new DIY customers. As a result, trailing twelve-month gross customer
revenue attrition excludes DIY customers for all periods presented in this offering memorandum. For all prior
reports covering periods prior to January 1, 2019, trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition included
DIY customers. Including DIY customers as of December 31, 2018 rounds to the same percentage as presented
in this offering memorandum.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) are non-GAAP measures that we believe are
useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business and to provide
additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect
to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to our operations. Further, we
believe Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) provide a meaningful measure of operating
profitability because we use them for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and

0


-----

comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and
amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of
dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with
subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and
other, (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs, net, (ix) financing and consent fees,
(x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments, and (xii) other charges and non-cash
items. We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our statement
of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment
(expensed net SAC).

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Adjusted
EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) do not take into account certain significant items, including
depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs,
which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic
effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted
EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below reconciles net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted
EBITDA (Pre-SAC) for the periods presented.

(d) Represents amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and compensation arrangements related to

acquisitions.

(e) Represents other income related to $22 million of one-time licensing fees.
(f) Represents other charges and non-cash items. During 2020, included recoveries of $10 million associated
with notes receivable from a former strategic investment. During 2019, included losses of $10 million
associated with notes receivable from a former strategic investment and $6 million associated with an
estimated legal settlement, net of insurance. During 2018, included a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of
equity in a third-party that we received as part of a settlement.

(g)  Represents expensed costs associated with the acquisition of new customers, net of revenue associated

with the sale of equipment.

(5) We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital

expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include accounts purchased through our network of authorized
dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network; subscriber system asset expenditures; and
purchases of property and equipment. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities
because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.
Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and
therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.
Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt
repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best
addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that our management employs to measure cash that is
available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to (i) net cash flow
associated with our consumer receivables facility, (ii) financing and consent fees, (iii) restructuring and
integration, (iv) integration related capital expenditures, (v) radio conversion costs, net and (vi) other payments or
receipts that may mask our operating results or business trends. As a result, subject to the limitations described
below, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash flow attributable to our normal business
activities, inclusive of the net cash flows associated with the acquisition of subscribers, as well as our ability to
repay other debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and
therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since
debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are
best addressed by using Adjusted Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.

During the second quarter of 2020, Free Cash Flow before special items was renamed Adjusted Free Cash Flow
to reflect the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, which supports our consumer
financing program that launched nationally in 2020. The inclusion of the net cash flow associated with our
consumer receivables facility represents the only revision to Free Cash Flow before special items.

The table below reconciles cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow
for the periods presented.

**RISK FACTORS**

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum, including the matters addressed under “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking
Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risks before investing in the Notes.

You should also read the risk factors and other cautionary statements, including those described
under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the 2020 Annual Report and the Q1 Quarterly Report filed by
ADT Inc., which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties due to the nature of the business activities we
conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may
experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us; or, as a result of developments
occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to raise_**
**_additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the_**
**_economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Notes._**

We are a highly leveraged company. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, we would have had $9,629 million face value of outstanding indebtedness
(excluding finance leases and indebtedness under the Receivables Facility). On a pro forma basis giving
effect to the Transactions, we will have total interest expense payments of $441 million (including
approximately $343 million of debt service relating to fixed rate obligations) for the first year following the
consummation of the Transactions.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you as a holder of the
Notes. For example, it could:

    - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness,
including the Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt
instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event
of default under the indenture governing the Notes and the agreements governing other
indebtedness;

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment
of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

    - make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a
competitive disadvantage;

    - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing
new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

14


-----

    - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among
other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets;

    - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes upon the occurrence of
certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute a default under the
indenture governing the Notes; or

    - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including
borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest.

In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes, the ADT
Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes contain, or will contain, restrictive covenants
that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to
comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result
in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make_**
**_payments on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that are not waived by the
required holders and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could leave us unable to
pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes and could substantially decrease the market value
of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds
necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness, or if
we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the
instruments governing our indebtedness (including the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the
First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes), we could be in default under the terms of the
agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness
could elect to (i) declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, (ii) terminate their commitments and cease making further loans and (iii) institute
foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the
required lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the holders of the ADT Notes, the FirstPriority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under
the documents governing our indebtedness and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver
from the required lenders or holders, as applicable. If this occurs, we would be in default under the
documents governing our indebtedness, the lenders or holders, as applicable, could exercise their rights
as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

Upon any such bankruptcy filing, under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the
“Bankruptcy Code”), we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the Notes, and the
holders of the Notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs or
charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeded the value of the
collateral (after taking into account all other senior debt that was also secured by the collateral), or any
“adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt,_**
**_which could intensify the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the
terms of the indenture governing the Notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain

15


-----

restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and
the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions
also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. As of the date
hereof on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately
$575 million available for additional borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility (without giving effect to
letters of credit), all of which would be secured on a first-priority basis. In addition to the Notes and our
indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the
Second-Priority Notes, the covenants under any other existing or future debt instruments could allow us
to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately
$102 million of uncommitted additional borrowing available under the Receivables Facility. The more
leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks
described above under “—Our substantial indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our ability
to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our
industry and prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness,_**
**_including the Notes, and to fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be_**
**_forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not_**
**_be successful._**

Our ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes and to satisfy our other debt obligations will
depend upon, among other things:

    - our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost savings
described herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive
conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control;

    - our future ability to refinance or restructure our existing debt obligations, which depends on,
among other things, the condition of the capital markets, our financial condition, and the
terms of existing or future debt agreements; and

    - our future ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which
depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit agreement
governing such facilities.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that
we will be able to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund
our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and
may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance
our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future
debt agreements, including the instruments governing the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes,
the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity
problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and
other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all.
Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to
meet our debt service obligations then due. Investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo

16


-----

Global Management, Inc., its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, who collectively are our controlling
shareholder, have no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to
generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, could result in a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our
obligations under the Notes.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of
the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes and lenders under the
First Lien Credit Agreement could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable,
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, our
secured lenders (including the lenders under our First Lien Credit Agreement and the holders of the
Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes) could foreclose against the
assets securing the indebtedness owing to them, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
All of these events could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the Notes.

If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to repay or refinance all or a portion of our
indebtedness, including the Notes, before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable
terms, or at all.

**_Changes in our credit rating could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the_**
**_Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including
us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us
based on their overall view of our industry. Additionally, we cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will
maintain their ratings on the Notes. A negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the
future trading prices of the Notes and on our ability to secure future debt financing on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.

**_Repayment of our debt, including the Notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow
by our subsidiaries and, if they are not guarantors of the Notes, their ability to make such cash available
to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes, our
subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for
that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to
enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries
is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our
ability to obtain cash from them and we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to
distribute their earnings to us. While the First Lien Credit Agreement, and the indentures governing the
ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes limit, and the indenture governing the
Notes will limit, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain
qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness,
including the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of current and future non-_**
**_guarantor subsidiaries._**

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the current and
future subsidiaries of Prime Borrower that are not or will not be guaranteeing the Notes, and the claims of
creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will have priority as to the assets of these

17


-----

subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries of Prime Borrower, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts,
holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of
their assets to us. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries generated less than 1% of our total revenue and less
than 1% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries held approximately 1% of our consolidated assets, with less
than 1% of our consolidated assets attributable to special purpose subsidiaries, and had $98 million of
outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations and finance leases, consisting of nonrecourse indebtedness of our special purpose subsidiaries .

In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade
payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of Prime Borrower’s special purpose subsidiaries, nonU.S. subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that are not material or wholly owned. These non-guarantor
subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes, or to make any funds available therefore, whether by
dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the guarantors have to receive any
assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those
subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of
those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’ creditors,
including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries.

**_The lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the discretion to release any_**
**_guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement in a variety of circumstances, which will_**
**_cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement remain outstanding, any guarantee
of the Notes by a subsidiary of Prime Borrower may be released without action by, or consent of, any
holder of the Notes or the trustee under the indenture that will govern the Notes, if the related guarantor is
no longer a guarantor of obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other indebtedness.
See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the
discretion to release the guarantees under the First Lien Credit Agreement in a variety of circumstances.
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the Notes, and
the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those
subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our_**
**_business._**

The First Lien Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Second-Priority Notes contain,
and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that
impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our
subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

    - incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness, or issue certain preferred equity interests;

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital
stock or make other restricted payments;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - make loans or certain investments;

18


-----

    - sell certain assets;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

    - alter the businesses we conduct;

    - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

    - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—First Lien Credit Agreement–Revolving Credit Facility.”

As a result of these covenants, we will continue to be limited in the manner in which we conduct
our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future
operations or capital needs.

A failure to comply with the covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness or any
of our other future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event
of any such default, the lenders thereunder:

    - will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;

    - could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest
and fees, to be immediately due and payable;

    - could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or

    - could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes;

any of which could result in an event of default under the Notes.

Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were
unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement could proceed against
the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our
assets as collateral under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement or our other
indebtedness, including the Notes, were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets
would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and
“Description of Notes.”

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero, avoided or_**
**_released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all_**
**_of the guarantors._**

The guarantees by the guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that such guarantors are
permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, any such guarantor’s liability under its guarantee
could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under

19


-----

the circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and
transfer statutes could avoid the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other
obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific
circumstances, to avoid the Notes and guarantees and the related security interests, and require holders
of Notes to return payments received.”

In addition, the guarantors will be automatically released from their guarantees upon the
occurrence of certain events, including the following:

    - the designation of a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

    - the release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the
guarantee of the Notes by a subsidiary guarantor; or

    - the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all the assets, of a subsidiary
guarantor.

If the guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of the Notes will have a claim as a
creditor against that entity, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and
preferred equity interests, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that entity will be structurally senior to
the claim of any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_There are limited covenants and protections in the indentures._**

While the indenture and the Notes contain terms intended to provide protection to holders upon
the occurrence of certain events involving significant corporate transactions and our creditworthiness,
these terms are limited and may not be sufficient to protect your investment in the Notes. For example,
there are no financial covenants in the indentures. In addition, consistent with the ADT Notes and the
First-Priority Notes, should the security interests in a substantial portion of the guarantees or collateral for
the Notes become unenforceable, holders will not have the ability to cause us to remedy such defect as
the indentures and the Notes will not contain provisions which would render such unenforceability an
event of default. As in the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, we will also be entitled to release
substantially all of the guarantees and collateral with a majority vote of holders of the Notes under the
applicable indenture. In addition, as described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control,” upon the
occurrence of a change of control triggering event, the Issuer is required to offer to all holders the right to
redeem their Notes at 101% of their principal amount. However, the definition of the term “Change of
Control Triggering Event” is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by
us, recapitalizations, reorganizations, ventures, mergers, “going private” or similar transactions by us or
our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of your Notes. A change of control transaction under
the indenture may only occur if there is either (i) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or (ii) a
change in the majority of the voting interest in our business coupled with the acquisition by a third-party of
an entitlement to receive more than 50% of our equity distributions or partner allocations. For a change of
control triggering event to occur there must be not only a change of control transaction as defined in the
indenture, but also a ratings downgrade resulting from such transaction. If we were to enter into a
significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes, but would not constitute a
change of control triggering event, you would not have any rights to require the Issuer to repurchase the
Notes prior to their maturity, which also would adversely affect your investment. The First Lien Credit
Agreement and the Second-Priority Notes require, and other future indebtedness may require, the
repurchase or repayment of such indebtedness upon a change of control regardless of whether such
indebtedness is downgraded at the time of such change of control. Therefore, holders of such other
indebtedness may have a right to be repaid or have their notes repurchased prior to the holders of the
Notes.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to
offer to repurchase all of the outstanding Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus, without
duplication, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. Additionally, under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, a change of control constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings and terminate their commitments to lend under the Revolving Credit
Facility. The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and
the Second-Priority Notes and repayment of borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement would be
our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including
borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the
time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of Notes or that restrictions in our other debt
documents will not allow such repurchases. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund
any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further,
our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain important corporate events,
such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not
constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the Notes. See “Description of Notes—
Change of Control.”

Courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which will be the governing
law of the indenture governing the Notes) have not provided clear and consistent meanings of such
change of control provisions, which leads to subjective judicial interpretation. In addition, a court case in
Delaware has questioned whether a change of control provision contained in an indenture could be
unenforceable on public policy grounds.

**_We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could_**
**_affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the
indenture governing the Notes may allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancing
or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a change of control but may increase our outstanding
indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. The definition of
change of control for purposes of the Notes includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or
substantially all” of our assets taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require us to repurchase Notes as a result of a transfer of
less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes_**
**_and guarantees and the related security interests, and require holders of Notes to return_**
**_payments received._**

If the Issuer or any guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code or
encounters other financial difficulty, under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer law a
court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the Notes or the guarantees and the related security
interests. A court might do so if it found that when the Issuer issued the Notes or the guarantor entered
into its guarantee, and, in each case, granted the related security interests, or in some states when
payments became due under the Notes or the guarantees, the Issuer or the guarantor received less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business;

21


-----

    - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to
pay; or

    - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages
docketed against the Issuer or the guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied
after final judgment.

The court might also avoid an issuance of Notes or a guarantee or the related security interest,
without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the Notes or the applicable
guarantor entered into its guarantee, and, in each case, provided the related security interest with the
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud their creditors.

A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for the Notes or its guarantee or the related security interest if the Issuer or a
guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the
guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the
guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the
obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or any guarantee or the related security
interest, you would no longer have any claim against the Issuer or the applicable guarantor, or the right to
enforce or otherwise benefit from the applicable security interest. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may
not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might
direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or a guarantor. In the event of
a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the
Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to the Issuer’s
and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws will
vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent conveyance
or transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its
assets;

    - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as
they become absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply in determining whether the Issuer or
the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this
regard, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a
guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including
under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or transfers on other
grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any
guarantor’s other debt.

Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that
guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of
obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, this provision may not be
effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance
or transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its
guarantee worthless. See “—Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to

22


-----

zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or
all of the guarantors” above.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the Notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made
at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned
to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is
made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other
party, and such payment would give the recipient more than it would have received in a distribution under
the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the
Notes or guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of
“equitable subordination” if the court determines that (a) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of
inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an
unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our_**
**_debt service obligations to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Receivables Facility are at variable
rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations
on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the
same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will
correspondingly decrease. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”)
announced that it intends to stop collecting LIBOR rates from banks after 2021. The announcement
indicates that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. More recently, on March 5, 2021 the
FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer
be representative. Specifically, this will occur immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all
sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings;
and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings.

However, U.S. banking regulators have made clear that U.S.-dollar LIBOR originations should
end by no later than December 30, 2021, and that new LIBOR originations prior to that date must provide
for an alternative reference rate or a hardwired fallback. In accordance with recommendations from the
Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), U.S. -dollar LIBOR is expected to be replaced with the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference to short-term
repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities. Further, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. recently announced fallback language for LIBOR-referencing derivatives contracts that
also provides for SOFR as the primary replacement rate in the event of a LIBOR cessation.

SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by
Treasury securities. SOFR is observed on a daily basis and backward looking, which stands in contrast
with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate for specified
tenors and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that
SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account
bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less
likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. As a result, parties may seek to adjust the
spreads relative to such reference rate in underlying contractual arrangements.

Although there have been issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an
alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether SOFR or any of the other
alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. There is currently no
definitive successor reference rate to LIBOR and various industry organizations are still working to
develop workable transition mechanisms.

23


-----

We are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of
any alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be
enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR
could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans,
derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us. As such, LIBOR-related
changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition.


We have entered into, and in the future we may continue to enter into, interest rate swaps that


involve the exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility. However,
we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable-rate indebtedness, and any
such swaps may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous, or may create
additional risks. Given the decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States to
bolster the financial markets in response to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
examined our interest rate sensitivity. Certain of our variable rate debt instruments, including our first lien
term loan, are subject to a 0.75% floor on interest rate payments. While we have hedged our interest rate
exposure to our variable rate debt, our hedging instruments do not include a floor and, accordingly, in this
current interest rate environment, any 0.125% decrease in LIBOR rates below 0.75% would result in an
increase of approximately $3 million in annualized interest expense on our variable-rate debt, including
the impact of our interest rate swaps. As a result of the changes in the interest rate environment in
response to macroeconomic decline due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our interest rate swap
contracts designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $3 billion were no longer
highly effective beginning in March 2020. Accordingly, we de-designated the cash flow hedges and the
changes in fair value for the period in which these cash flow hedges were no longer highly effective were
recognized in interest expense. This may cause ongoing volatility in our reported GAAP results.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes without registration or_**
**_the filing of a prospectus under applicable securities laws, and the Notes are not subject_**
**_to any future registration rights or obligations._**

The Notes are being issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state and securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United
States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. We will not be obligated to offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under the Securities Act or to register the reoffer and resale of Notes under applicable
securities laws. As a result, the transferability of the Notes may be negatively affected. By receiving the
Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as
set forth under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will not be qualified
under the TIA and the Issuer will not be required to comply with the provisions of the TIA. Therefore,
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the TIA or similar
provisions in the indenture governing the Notes.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading_**
**_market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if_**
**_developed be maintained, for the Notes._**

The Notes are each a new issue of securities for which there is no established public trading
market. We do not intend to have the Notes listed on a national securities exchange or included in any
automated quotation system. Affiliates of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, if issued, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, but they are not
obligated to make a market in any of the Notes, and they may discontinue their market making
activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for any of the Notes may not develop
or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend upon the
number of holders of the Notes, our performance, the market for similar securities, the interest of
securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. A liquid trading market may not

24


-----

develop for the Notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity
of the Notes may be materially and adversely affected. The market, if any, for any of the Notes may not
be free from disruptions that may cause substantial volatility in the price of the Notes, and any such
disruptions may materially and adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes. In
addition, the Notes may trade at a discount from their value on the date you acquired the Notes,
depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other
factors.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the Notes at maturity._**

At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, will become due and payable. We may not have the funds to fulfill these obligations or
the ability to renegotiate these obligations. If, upon the maturity date, other arrangements prohibit us
from repaying the Notes, we could try to obtain waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and
holders under those arrangements, or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the
restrictions. In these circumstances, if we were not able to obtain such waivers or refinance these
borrowings, we would be unable to repay the Notes.

**_The market price for the Notes may be volatile and may require you to hold the Notes_**
**_for an indefinite period of time._**

The market for investment grade debt, such as the Notes, may become subject to disruptions that
may cause substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any market that may
develop for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may negatively
impact the value of your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at
a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders must rely on_**
**_the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until certificated notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes,
owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. Instead, DTC, or
its nominee, will be the sole holder of the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the paying agent, which will make
payments to DTC. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to DTC participants’ accounts that hold
book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the Notes. Instead, if a holder owns a book-entry interest, such holder will be permitted to act
only to the extent such holder has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, a
participant. We cannot assure holders that the procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable holders to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the_**
**_collateral that secures our First Lien Credit Agreement, the representative of the lenders_**
**_under the First Lien Credit Agreement will initially control actions with respect to the_**
**_collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the collateral that will secure the Notes on a
first-priority basis will be subject to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the
representatives of the holders of the Notes, the holders of the ADT Notes, the holders of the FirstPriority Notes and the lenders under our First Lien Credit Agreement. Under the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the

25


-----

ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control
such proceedings will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under our First
Lien Credit Agreement until (1) our obligations under our First Lien Credit Agreement are discharged
(which discharge does not include certain refinancings of our First Lien Credit Agreement) or (2) 180
days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing the ADT Notes or the
First-Priority Notes, as applicable, if the authorized representative of the holders of the ADT Notes or
the First-Priority Notes, as applicable, represents the largest outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral and has complied with the applicable
notice provisions and if the ADT Notes or the First-Priority Notes, as applicable, are at the time due and
payable in full.

In addition, the documents governing our indebtedness will permit us, subject to certain limits, to
issue additional series of notes or other debt that also have a first-priority lien on the same collateral. At
any time that the representative of the lenders under our First Lien Credit Agreement does not have the
right to take actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest
outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral, which, on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, would be Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as trustee for the 5.750% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2026.

Similarly, if we issue additional first lien notes or other debt in the future in a greater principal
amount than each of the Notes, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, then the authorized
representative for those additional Notes or other debt would exercise rights under the First Lien/First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement before the authorized representative for the Notes.

However, even if the Notes represent the largest series of first lien debt and the authorized
representative of the Notes gains the right to direct the collateral agent in the circumstances described
above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the
collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under our First Lien Credit
Agreement) if the authorized representative of the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement has
commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of
the security interest in that collateral (whether an Issuer or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then
a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes._**

The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the trustee for the Notes and the collateral agent
thereunder (the “Notes Collateral Agent”) any other creditors that have the benefit of senior-priority
liens on the collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are
issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability
of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions,
including the availability of suitable buyers. No appraisals of any of the collateral have been prepared
by us or on behalf of us in connection with this offering. By their nature, some or all of the pledged
assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that
the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the
principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the
Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to
implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events.
Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes,
the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the First Lien Credit Agreement (and any additional future

26


-----

pari passu obligations). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of
the Notes from the sale of the collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes and the
ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the First Lien Credit Agreement (and any additional future pari
passu obligations) will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated
indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a
bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of
principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations,
interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed and
you will not be entitled to adequate protection of any such under-secured amount.

The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a
contract. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent.
We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability
to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the collateral securing the Notes will be subject to liens permitted under the terms of
the indenture governing the Notes, whether arising on or after the date the Notes are issued. The
existence of any permitted liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral
securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such
collateral. Furthermore, not all of the Issuer and guarantors’ assets secure the Notes. See “Description
of Notes—Security.”

For example, the collateral will not include, among other things:

    - certain real property;

    - motor vehicles and certain commercial tort claims;

    - those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such assets would be
prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual obligations (including
leases, licenses or other agreements, government licenses or state or local license,
franchises, charters or authorizations (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is
unenforceable after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code);

    - assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to result
in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by Prime Borrower;

    - “intent-to-use” trademark applications until an Amendment to Allege Use or Statement of Use
has been filed;

    - certain securitization assets; or

    - certain other limited assets.

Some of these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse
effect on the value of the collateral.

27


-----

**_Rights in the collateral may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_security interests in collateral now or in the future._**

Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party.
The liens in the collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if the Notes Collateral Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these
liens. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the Noteholders’ security interest in
specified collateral. For example, with respect to collateral consisting of copyrights held by the Issuer or
the guarantors on the issue date, we expect that we will only be required to perfect the Notes Collateral
Agent’s security interest in certain registered U.S. copyrights. In addition, applicable law provides that
certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property,
certain intellectual property and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and
rights are acquired and identified. The Notes Collateral Agent will not monitor and has no obligation to
monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future
acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken
to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the
loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes
Collateral Agent, as applicable, against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does take all
actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests, any such security interests that are
perfected after the date of the indenture would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer
or otherwise in any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on the closing date were no
longer subject to such risk.

In addition, even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired in
the future, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference in any
bankruptcy case under certain circumstances. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any
guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could
be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_collateral securing the Notes and guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (other than to the Issuer or a guarantor)
in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the Notes;

    - in respect of the property and assets of a restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor, upon the
designation of such guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the indenture
governing the Notes;

    - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its
guarantee;

    - in respect of the property and assets of a guarantor, upon the release or discharge of the
pledge granted by such guarantor to secure the obligations under the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any other indebtedness the guarantee in respect of which resulted in the
obligation to become a guarantor with respect to the Notes; and

    - pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in the event the applicable
collateral agent is exercising remedies with respect to the collateral.

28


-----

The guarantee of a guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in
connection with a sale of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture governing the
Notes. The indenture also permits us to designate one or more of the restricted subsidiaries of Prime
Borrower that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture governing the Notes, all of the liens on any collateral
owned by such entity or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such entity will be
released and the aggregate value of the collateral securing the Notes will be reduced. In addition, the
creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of such
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries that is senior to the claim of the holders of the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by_**
**_us could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and the guarantees._**

The collateral documents for the Notes will allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing
the Notes and the related guarantees. In addition, we will not be required to comply with all or any
portion of the TIA, including, without limitation, Section 314(d) thereof. We may, therefore, among other
things, without any release or consent by the trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
collateral permitted by the indenture governing the Notes, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of collateral and making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of
indebtedness), all of which could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes. See “Description of
Notes—Security.”

For example, certain of our receivables and other assets may from time to time be sold,
contributed or transferred to a special purposes entity that is not a guarantor, pursuant to the
Receivables Facility, and thereupon, such assets will not constitute collateral securing the Notes. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness – Receivables Facility.”

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax_**
**_purposes._**

If the Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity exceeds their “issue price,” as determined under
U.S. Treasury regulations, by more than a statutory de minimis amount, the Notes will be treated as
issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued
with OID, in addition to including stated interest as ordinary interest income in accordance with a U.S.
Holder’s regular method of tax accounting, each U.S. Holder must include OID in gross income as
ordinary income regardless of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method. A U.S. Holder must include OID
in income as it accrues calculated on a constant yield to maturity method before the receipt of cash
attributable to the income, and will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of
OID over the life of the Notes. The rules governing instruments with OID are complex. Prospective
investors should see “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for additional information and
are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the application of such rules to the Notes.

**_If the Notes are issued with OID, and a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against_**
**_us, the allowed claim for the Notes may be less than the principal amount of the_**
**_Notes stated in the indenture governing the Notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of
the Notes, the claim by any holder of the Notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an
amount equal to the sum of:

    - the original issue price of the Notes; and

29


-----

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the Notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if
any, that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the Notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than
the principal amount thereof stated in the indenture governing the Notes.

**_If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your_**
**_ability to realize value from the collateral._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess, and dispose of the collateral
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes is likely to be
significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case
were to be commenced by or against us before the Notes Collateral Agent repossessed and disposed
of the collateral (and sometimes even after). Upon the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy
Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from
such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given or could be materially
delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral
even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured
creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary
according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s
interest in the collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash
payments or the granting of additional or replacement security or superpriority administrative expense
claims if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the
secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A
bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for any such
diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad
discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of
a bankruptcy case, or the length of any delay in making such payments;

    - whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time; or

    - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in
payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection” or
otherwise.

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given or could be materially delayed). Furthermore, in the event a
bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on
debt which is to be paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold a
secured claim only to the extent of the value of the collateral to which the holders of the Notes are
entitled and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to any shortfall or undercollateralization. The
Bankruptcy Code only permits the payment and accrual of post- petition interest, costs and attorneys’
fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of its collateral is
determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
obligations secured by the collateral.

30


-----

In addition, under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of
the holders of the Notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in
possession financing or to the use of the shared collateral to secure that financing, subject to certain
conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially
deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_The security interests of the noteholders in after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a_**
**_timely manner or at all._**

If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries of Prime Borrower are formed or acquired and
become guarantors under the indenture governing the Notes, additional financing statements would be
required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the
type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to
perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by
the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or
deeds of trust. Even if such additional actions are taken to perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral, to the extent a security interest in any collateral is not perfected on the issue date of
the Notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or
otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Delivery of security interests in
collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the security interests or such
guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy” below.

**_Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date_**
**_increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in_**
**_bankruptcy._**

Certain collateral, including mortgages on certain of our real properties and after-acquired
property, will be secured after the issue date of the Notes, and certain guarantees will be granted after
the issue date of the Notes. To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes is not
perfected after the issue date of the Notes, we will use our commercially reasonably efforts to have all
such security interests perfected within 120 days following the issue date of the Notes. If the grantor of
such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after the issue
date of the Notes, any security interest in other collateral, or any guarantees delivered after the issue
date of the Notes, would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on the issue
date (or within 30 days thereof) of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession)
or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under the Bankruptcy
Code if certain events or circumstances exist or occur.

Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date (or after 30 days thereof)
of the Notes may be treated under the Bankruptcy Code as if they were delivered to secure or
guarantee previously existing or “antecedent” indebtedness. Any future pledge of collateral or future
issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the Notes, including pursuant to security documents
or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the Notes are issued, may be avoidable
as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of
the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits
the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the
pledge or guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or
guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance
of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a year. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any
guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the Notes and (1) any liens not
granted on the issue date of the Notes had been perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the
issue date of the Notes (as applicable) had been issued, less than 90 days before commencement of
such bankruptcy case (or, if applicable, one year), such liens or guarantees are more likely to be
avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue

31


-----

date of the Notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the issue date (or within 30
days thereof) of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any
such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the
benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and may be required to return prior
payments.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks, which may limit your ability to recover as a_**
**_secured creditor if there are losses to the collateral, and which may have an adverse_**
**_impact on our operations and results._**

We maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards. There are, however, losses
that may be not be insured. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, we cannot
assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the first-priority
secured obligations, including the Notes, the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the FirstPriority Notes and related guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss affecting any of our assets,
certain items may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage,
the extended period needed to obtain replacement units or inventory may cause significant delays,
which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results. In addition, certain zoning or other
laws and regulations may prevent rebuilding substantially the same facilities in the event of a loss,
which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results. Such adverse impacts may not be
covered, or fully covered, by property or business interruption insurance.

**_With respect to our real property to be mortgaged as security for the Notes, we do not_**
**_expect all title insurance policies will be in place at the time of the issuance of the_**
**_Notes. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the issuance of_**
**_such title policies may impact the value of the collateral._**

We do not expect that we will have title insurance policies on the real properties to be mortgaged
as security for the Notes in place at the time of the issuance of the Notes to insure, among other things,
(i) loss resulting from the entity represented by us to be the owner thereof not holding fee title in the
properties and such interest being encumbered by unpermitted liens and (ii) the validity and first lien
priority of the mortgage granted to the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the
trustee and the holders of the Notes. We have agreed to obtain title insurance on the mortgaged
properties within 120 days following the issue date of the Notes or as soon as practical thereafter using
commercially reasonable efforts. In addition, if a title defect results in a loss, we cannot assure you that
any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including
the Notes.

**_State law may limit the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the real_**
**_property and improvements included in the collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on owned real property and improvements
of at least $5.0 million in fair market value located in several states. The laws of these states may limit
the ability of the trustee and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on the real property collateral and
improvements located in such states. State law governs the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure
of mortgage liens against real property interests that secure debt obligations such as the Notes.
Applicable state laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure different from and
necessitating a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security
interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it has
been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of
redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and one form of action
rules that can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property
collateral regardless of the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency
following a foreclosure.

subject to the repayment, extension, or refinancing with longer maturity debt of certain of Prime Borrower’s other
indebtedness, and obtain an additional $175 million of commitments under the Extended First Lien Revolving
Credit Facility.

(3) As of March 31, 2021, $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 ADT Notes were outstanding.
Assumes that the Issuer will redeem $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2022 ADT Notes
on August 28, 2021, (with payment of the redemption price to take place on August 30, 2021, which is the first
business day after the redemption date) and pay all accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable redemption
premium on such 2022 ADT Notes to, but excluding, such date, in accordance with the indenture governing the
2022 ADT Notes, which we expect will amount to approximately $31 million. The 2022 ADT Notes have a
maturity date of July 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 3.500% per annum. Prior to July 15, 2022, the Issuer
may redeem the 2022 ADT Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 ADT Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

purpose entity under the Receivables Facility. Non-recourse borrowings are not restricted under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes or the Second-Priority Notes. See "Description of
Other Indebtedness- Receivables Facility."

(5) Excludes amounts associated with debt discount, deferred financing costs, and fair value adjustments. As of
March 31, 2021, these amounts totaled $263 million. We anticipate that this amount will decrease by (a) $14
million associated with the full write-off of an unfavorable fair value adjustment on the 2022 ADT Notes and
increase by (b) $12 million associated with debt issuance costs associated with the Notes.

(6) As of March 31, 2021, stockholders' equity was approximately $2,978 million. We expect that this amount will
decrease by $27 million associated with the payment of the redemption premium on the 2022 ADT Notes, and by
$14 million associated with the full write-off of an unfavorable fair value adjustment on the 2022 ADT Notes.

(7) Represents outstanding shares of common stock of 820,055,823 (excluding unvested shares and including
54,744,525 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 outstanding held by Google LLC) multiplied by the
closing price of our shares of common stock of (a) $8.44 per share as reported on March 31, 2021 and (b)
$10.54 per share as reported on July 13, 2021.

(8) Represents the aggregate of (a) total debt plus (b) market capitalization.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements does not purport
to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents.

**First Lien Credit Agreement**

**_General_**

Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Prime Borrower”),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the borrower under that certain Eleventh Amended and
Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended and restated on May 2,
2016, June 23, 2016, December 28, 2016, February 13, 2017, June 29, 2017, March 16, 2018, December
3, 2018, March 15, 2019, September 23, 2019, January 27, 2021 and July 2, 2021 (the “First Lien Credit
Agreement”), consisting of:

    - a first lien term loan, in an aggregate principal amount of $2,779 million, maturing on
September 23, 2026 (with a springing maturity inside the maturity date of certain long term
Indebtedness to the extent such Indebtedness is not refinanced) (the “First Lien Term Loan
Facility”); and

    - a first lien revolving credit facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $575 million,
maturing on June 23, 2026 (with a springing maturity inside the maturity date of certain long
term Indebtedness to the extent such indebtedness is not refinanced) (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”).

As of March 31, 2021, Prime Borrower had borrowings of $2,779 million outstanding under the
First Lien Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition: (i) under the First Lien Credit Agreement, Prime Borrower may request one or more
incremental term loan facilities or incremental revolving credit facilities and/or increase commitments
under the First Lien Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to
the sum of a specified dollar amount plus any additional amounts so long as on a pro forma basis (a) in
the case of loans under such incremental facilities secured by liens that rank pari passu with the liens
securing the First Lien Credit Agreement, Prime Borrower’s consolidated net first lien senior secured
leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.20 to 1.00 and (b) in the case of loans under such incremental
facilities that rank junior to the liens securing the First Lien Credit Agreement, Prime Borrower’s
consolidated total net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.60 to 1.00. The incurrence of
incremental facilities under the credit agreements governing the First Lien Credit Agreement is subject, in
each case, to certain conditions, the receipt of commitments from existing or additional lenders and the
limitations on incurring additional indebtedness applicable to Prime Borrower and its subsidiaries,
including under the indentures governing the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the
Second-Priority Notes and each other agreement governing Prime Borrower’s indebtedness.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary
conditions, including the absence of a default and the material accuracy of representations and
warranties, and are available to fund any ordinary course working capital requirements or for general
corporate purposes.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at
our option, either (a) adjusted LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for dollar deposits for
the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a 0.75% floor in the case of the First Lien Term
Loan Facility, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective

36


-----

rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the
U.S. or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest per annum interest rate
published by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (Selected
Interest Rates) as the “bank prime loan” rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted therein, any similar rate
quoted or any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus
1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base
Rate loans (in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to one 25 basis point stepdown based on
a net first lien leverage ratio).

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the First Lien Credit Agreement,
Prime Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee between 0.375% and 0.50% (determined based on a
net first lien leverage ratio) with respect to the unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Amortization and Prepayments_**

The First Lien Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in annual amounts
equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of the term loans that were outstanding on January 27, 2021, with
the balance payable at maturity.

In addition, the First Lien Term Loan Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loan
borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with:

    - 50% (which percentage will be reduced if the consolidated net first lien senior secured
leverage ratio is less than or equal to certain thresholds) of Prime Borrower’s excess cash
flow, as defined under the First Lien Credit Agreement;

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales, other dispositions of
property or certain casualty events, in each case subject to certain exceptions and provided
that Prime Borrower may (a) reinvest within twelve months or (b) commit to reinvest those
proceeds and so reinvest such proceeds within 18 months in assets to be used in its
business, or certain other permitted investments; and

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt, other than proceeds from debt
permitted under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_Collateral and Guarantors_**

All obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Prime
Security Services Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”) on a limited-recourse basis and by each of Prime Borrower’s
existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain
exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of Prime Borrower’s capital stock and substantially
all of Prime Borrower’s assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the
subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are not
subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist of a firstpriority lien with respect to the collateral.

**_Restrictive Covenants and Other Matters_**

The Revolving Credit Facility requires that Prime Borrower, subject to a testing threshold, comply
as of the last day of each fiscal quarter with a specified maximum consolidated net first lien senior
secured leverage ratio. The testing threshold will be satisfied at any time at which the sum of outstanding
loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions, exceeds 30% of the outstanding
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at such fiscal quarter end.

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of
default. The negative covenants in the First Lien Credit Agreement include, among other things,
limitations (none of which are absolute) on our ability to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred
equity interests; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions);
pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;
consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into
certain transactions with our affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; restrict dividends from our
subsidiaries or restrict liens; change our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational
agreements in a manner materially adverse to lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**First-Priority Notes**

On April 4, 2019, Prime Borrower and Prime Finance, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company (“Prime Finance” and, together with Prime Borrower, the “Prime
Issuers”), issued $750 million in principal amount of 5.250% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2024
(the “2024 Notes) and $750 million in principal amount of 5.750% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due
2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In addition, on September 23, 2019, the Prime Issuers issued an additional
$600 million in principal amount of the 2026 Notes (the “Tack-on 2026 Notes”). The Prime Issuers also
issued $1,000 million in principal amount of 3.375% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the
“2027 Notes” and together with the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes and the Tack-on 2026 Notes, the
“First-Priority Notes”).

Each series of First-Priority Notes is governed by an indenture between the Prime Issuers and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, and we refer to these indentures (as they may have
been supplemented from time to time prior to the date hereof) collectively as the “First-Priority Notes
Indentures.” Under the First-Priority Notes Indentures, the Prime Issuers may redeem First-Priority Notes,
in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the
notes to be redeemed, plus an applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

The First-Priority Notes Indentures contain covenants that, among other things and subject to a
number of qualifications and exceptions, limit the Prime Issuers ability, and the ability of its restricted
subsidiaries, to (i) create liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and lease-back transactions; and
(iii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In the event of a
change in control triggering event (as defined in the applicable First-Priority Notes Indentures), the Prime
Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase such notes. The First-Priority Notes Indentures also
provide for customary events of default which, if triggered, would permit the acceleration of the debt
thereunder.

In addition, the First-Priority Notes benefit from (i) guarantees by each of the Prime Issuer’s
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement, (ii) first-priority security
interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of the Prime Issuer’s existing and future assets and
those of each guarantor, which assets also secure the First Lien Credit Agreement and the ADT Notes on
a first-priority basis and the Second-Priority Notes on a second-priority basis, and (iii) a substantially
similar reporting covenant as the Second-Priority Notes and the ADT Notes.

**ADT Notes**

The Issuer is the issuer of each of the following series of notes, which we refer to collectively as
the “ADT Notes”:

    - $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Notes due 2022, which mature on July
15, 2022;

38


-----

    - $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2023, which mature on
June 15, 2023;

    - $728 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due
2032, which mature on July 15, 2032; and

    - $22 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Notes due 2042, which mature on July 15,
2042.

Each series of ADT Notes is governed by an indenture between the Issuer and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, as trustee, and we refer to these indentures (as they may have been
supplemented from time to time prior to the date hereof) collectively as the “ADT Notes Indentures.”
Under the ADT Notes Indentures, the Issuer may redeem ADT Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a
redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus an applicable makewhole premium for each series of the ADT Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

The ADT Notes Indentures contain covenants that, among other things and subject to a number
of qualifications and exceptions, limit the Issuer’s ability, and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries, to (i)
create liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and lease-back transactions; and (iii) consolidate, merge,
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In the event of a change in control
triggering event (as defined in the applicable ADT Notes Indenture), the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase such notes. The ADT Notes Indentures also provide for customary events of default
which, if triggered, would permit the acceleration of the debt thereunder.

In addition, the ADT Notes benefit from (i) guarantees by Prime Borrower and each of its
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement (other than the Issuer, as
the issuer of the ADT Notes), (ii) first-priority security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially
all of the Issuer’s existing and future assets and those of each guarantor, which assets also secure the
First Lien Credit Agreement and the First-Priority Notes on a on a first-priority basis and the SecondPriority Notes on a second-priority basis, and (iii) a substantially similar reporting covenant as the FirstPriority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes.

**Second-Priority Notes**

On January 28, 2020, the Prime Issuers issued $1,300 million in aggregate principal amount of
6.250% Second- Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Second-Priority Notes”). The SecondPriority Notes mature on January 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 6.250% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2020.

The Prime Issuers may redeem the Second-Priority Notes at their option, in whole or in part, at
any time on or after January 15, 2023, at certain redemption prices. In addition, prior to January 15, 2023,
the Prime Issuers may redeem the Second-Priority Notes at their option, in whole at any time or in part
from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Second-Priority
Notes redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time and from time to time on or prior to January 15, 2023, the Prime Issuers may
redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Second-Priority
Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional Notes) in an aggregate amount equal to
the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the
principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Second-Priority Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Prime Issuer’s
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement. The Second-Priority
Notes are also secured by substantially all of the Prime Issuer’s assets and those of each subsidiary
guarantor, in each case by the same assets that secure the First Lien Credit Agreement including the

39


-----

capital stock of the subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries
that are not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests
consist of a second-priority lien with respect to the collateral.

The Second-Priority Notes contain certain customary negative covenants and events of default.
The negative covenants limit Prime Borrower’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other
things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, create liens on certain assets, pay
dividends or prepay junior debt or make other restricted payments, make certain loans, acquisitions or
investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, conduct asset sales, restrict dividends from
subsidiaries or restrict liens, or merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
Prime Borrower’s assets.

**Receivables Facility**

During March 2020, ADT LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ADT LLC”), entered into an
uncommitted receivables securitization financing agreement, dated as of March 5, 2020, among ADT
LLC, individually and as servicer, ADT Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as seller, the
various purchasers and purchaser agents from time to time party thereto and Mizuho Bank, LTD. as
administrative agent, arranger, collateral agent and structuring agent, (the “Receivables Facility”). Under
the terms of the Receivables Facility, ADT LLC may receive up to $200 million of financing secured by
retail installment contract receivables from transactions involving security systems that were sold under a
customer-owned model. During April 2020, ADT LLC amended the Receivables Facility to also permit
financing secured by retail installment contract receivables from transactions occurring under a Companyowned model. In March 2021, ADT LLC amended the Receivables Facility to, among other things, extend
the revolving period until March 4, 2022, and reduced the LIBOR floor from 1.00% to 0.85%. If the
revolving period is not extended, ADT LLC is required to repay the Receivables Facility in a manner
consistent with the contractual collections of the underlying retail installment contract receivables. ADT
LLC may make voluntary prepayments on the Receivables Facility at any time prior to maturity at par.

ADT LLC obtains financing by selling or contributing certain retail installment contract receivables
to the Company’s wholly-owned consolidated bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (the “SPE”),
which, pursuant to the Receivables Facility, borrows funds secured by the transferred retail installment
contract receivables. The SPE is a separate legal entity with its own creditors who will be entitled, prior to
and upon the liquidation of the SPE, to be satisfied out of the SPE’s assets prior to any assets in the SPE
becoming available to ADT LLC (other than the SPE). Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not
available to pay creditors of ADT LLC (other than the SPE), although collections from the transferred
retail installment contract receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the SPE’s creditors may be
remitted to ADT LLC during and after the term of the Receivables Facility. The SPE’s creditors have legal
recourse to the transferred retail installment contract receivables owned by the SPE, but do not have any
recourse to ADT LLC (other than the SPE) for the payment of principal and interest on the SPE’s
financing.

ADT LLC services the transferred retail installment contract receivables and is responsible for
ensuring that amounts collected from the transferred retail installment contract receivables are remitted to
a segregated bank account in the name of the SPE. ADT LLC is required to deposit payments received
from the transferred retail installment contract receivables into a segregated account maintained by a
third party. On a monthly basis, the segregated account is utilized to make required principal, interest,
and other payments due under the Receivables Facility.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company received proceeds of $30 million

under the Receivables Facility and repaid $7 million. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had an
outstanding balance of $98 million and an uncommitted available borrowing capacity of $102 million
under the Receivables Facility. The Receivables Facility did not have a material impact to the condensed
consolidated statements of operations.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”), among The ADT Security
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, not in its individual capacity, but solely as trustee (the “Trustee”).

We urge you to read the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreements because they, not the summaries below, define your rights. You may obtain a copy of these
documents as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section shall have the respective meanings set forth
in the Indenture.

**General**

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will have the benefit of the first-priority
security interests in the Collateral described below under “—Security.” The Issuer will issue a total of
$1,000,000,000 initial aggregate principal amount of   % First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2029
(the “Notes”). Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this
“Description of Notes,” references to the Notes include any additional notes actually issued, see “—
Additional Notes”.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of   % per year. The date from which interest will accrue on
the Notes will be from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date on
which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August
1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2022 to the holders of record at the close of business on the
January 15 and July 15 prior to each interest payment date. The basis upon which interest shall be
calculated will be that of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

The Notes will be issuable in whole in the registered form of one or more global securities, and
the depository for such global securities shall be The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York.
The Notes will be issuable in minimum denominations of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof.

Except as provided below, the Notes shall not be subject to redemption, repurchase or repayment
at the option of any holder thereof, upon the occurrence of any particular circumstances or otherwise. The
Notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund. The Notes are not convertible into shares of common
stock or other securities of the Issuer.

Barclays Bank PLC, the administrative agent and collateral agent under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, will also be the collateral agent, either in its own capacity or by means of a subagent or a
designee, for the holders of the Notes. The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral
that will secure the Notes on a first-priority basis will be subject to a First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2016, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and a First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified.

We and the Guarantors will not be obligated to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered
under U.S. securities laws or register the reoffer and resale of the Notes under U.S. securities laws. As a
result, the transferability of the Notes may be negatively affected. By receiving the Notes, you will be
deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”),
and the Issuer will not be required to comply with the provisions of the TIA. Therefore, holders of the

41


-----

Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the TIA or similar provisions in
the Indenture.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, will rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and_
future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, will have the benefit of the security interest
in the Collateral as described under “—Security” and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and
future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The Notes will have the benefit of a security interest in the Collateral that will be first in priority
and _pari passu with the liens securing the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT_
Notes, the First-Priority Notes and all other existing and future First Priority Lien Obligations, and senior in
priority to the Second-Priority Notes and all other existing and future Second Priority Lien Obligations,
with respect to all Collateral, subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions described under “—
Security.” Prime Borrower and all of its Domestic Subsidiaries other than the Issuer that are Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries and that guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the
First-Priority Notes, the Second-Priority Notes or any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantors
will become Guarantors with respect to the Notes, and their assets and property will secure the Notes to
the extent described below under “—Guarantees“ and below under “—Security.”

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, Prime
Borrower and its Subsidiaries would have had:

(1) $8,329 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting First Priority Lien Obligations, consisting
of (a) $2,779 million of secured Indebtedness outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement,
(b) $1,450 million aggregate principal amount of secured Indebtedness outstanding under the
ADT Notes, (c) $3,100 million aggregate principal amount of secured Indebtedness outstanding
under the First-Priority Notes and (d) $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of secured
Indebtedness outstanding under the Notes;

(2) approximately $62 million of Capitalized Lease Obligations;

(3) $1,300 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting Second Priority Lien Obligations,
consisting entirely of $1,300 million of outstanding Indebtedness under the Second-Priority Notes;

(4) no senior unsecured indebtedness; and

(5) $98 million of outstanding Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of Prime Borrower that are not the Issuer
or Guarantors, consisting of outstanding Indebtedness under Permitted Securitization Financings
(as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement).

In addition, as of the date hereof, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
Prime Borrower would have had $575 million of unutilized capacity (without giving effect to letters of
credit) under the revolving facility of the First Lien Credit Agreement, which would constitute First Priority
Lien Obligations, if drawn.

Prime Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries are able to incur additional amounts of
Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and,
subject to certain limitations, such Indebtedness may be secured Indebtedness constituting other First
Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations.

Unless a Subsidiary of Prime Borrower is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary,
including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will

42


-----

have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the
Issuer, including holders of the Notes. The holders of the Notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated
to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if
any) of any Subsidiary of Prime Borrower that is not a Guarantor. As of the Issue Date, the only
Subsidiaries of Prime Borrower that are not Guarantors will be (i) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, (ii)
Immaterial Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the
date hereof), (iii) Foreign Subsidiaries, (iv) Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiaries (as such term is
defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof) and (v) Subsidiaries of the
foregoing, all of which, as of March 31, 2021, had $98 million of outstanding Indebtedness, excluding
intercompany obligations, consisting of Non-Recourse Indebtedness of our Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The
Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our current and future non-guarantor
subsidiaries.”

**Security**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests (subject to certain
permitted liens) in the Collateral. The Collateral consists of substantially all of the property and assets, in
each case, that are held by the Issuer or any Guarantor, to the extent that such assets secure the other
First Priority Lien Obligations.

The initial Collateral does not include, subject to certain exceptions:

(i) any real property other than Material Real Property;

(ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title and letter of credit rights (in
each case, except to the extent a Lien on such assets or such rights can be perfected by
filing a UCC-1 financing statement) and commercial tort claims with a value of less than
$10,000,000;

(iii) assets to the extent the pledges and security interests therein are prohibited by
applicable law, rule, regulation or contractual obligation permitted under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the Security Documents and certain other documents and binding on
assets to the extent in existence on May 2, 2016 or on the date of acquisition thereof and
not entered into in contemplation of acquisition of such asset (in each case, except to the
extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or which could
require governmental (including regulatory) consent, approval, license or authorization to
be pledged (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received);

(iv) assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to
result in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by Prime
Borrower in consultation with the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent;

(v) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness with respect to which the First-Priority Collateral
Agent and Prime Borrower reasonably agree that the cost or other consequences of
pledging such Equity Interests or Indebtedness under the Security Documents are likely
to be excessive in relation to the value to be afforded thereby;

(vi) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiary that is a
CFC (in each case, that is owned directly by the Issuer or any Guarantor) to secure the
Notes Obligations, any voting Equity Interest of such Foreign Subsidiary in excess of
65% of the outstanding Equity Interests of such class;

(vii) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any FSHCO (in each case, that is

43


-----

owned directly by the Issuer or any Guarantor) to secure the Notes Obligations, any
voting Equity Interest of such FSHCO in excess of 65% of the outstanding Equity
Interests of such class;

(viii) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness to the extent the pledge thereof would be prohibited
by any requirement of law;

(ix) any Equity Interests of any Person that is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary to the extent
(A) that a pledge thereof to secure the Notes Obligations is prohibited by (i) any
applicable organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement
or (ii) any other contractual obligation with an unaffiliated third party not in violation of
certain provisions of the First Lien Credit Agreement (other than, in this subclause (A)(ii),
customary non-assignment provisions which are ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code or other applicable requirements of law), (B) any organizational
documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement (or other contractual
obligation referred to in subclause (A)(ii) above) prohibits such a pledge without the
consent of any other party; provided, that this clause (B) shall not apply if (1) such other
party is the Issuer, Holdings, a Guarantor or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or (2) consent
has been obtained to consummate such pledge (it being understood that the foregoing
shall not be deemed to obligate the Issuer, Prime Borrower or any Subsidiary to obtain
any such consent) and shall apply for so long as such organizational documents, joint
venture agreement or shareholder agreement or replacement or renewal thereof is in
effect, or (C) a pledge thereof to secure the Notes Obligations would give any other party
(other than the Issuer, Holdings, a Guarantor or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) to any
organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement governing
such Equity Interests (or other contractual obligation referred to in subclause (A)(ii)
above) the right to terminate its obligations thereunder (other than, in the case of other
contractual obligations referred to in subclause (A)(ii), customary non-assignment
provisions which are ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable requirement of law);

(x) any Equity Interests of any Immaterial Subsidiary (as such term is defined in the First
Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof), any Unrestricted Subsidiary or
any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary (as each such term is defined in the First
Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof);

(xi) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of, or other Equity Interests owned by, a Foreign
Subsidiary;

(xii) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Equity
Interests could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences
to Prime Borrower or any Subsidiary as determined in good faith by Prime Borrower in
consultation with the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent;

(xiii) any Equity Interests that are set forth on certain schedules to the First Lien Credit
Agreement or that have been identified on or prior to May 2, 2016 in writing to the FirstPriority Collateral Agent by Prime Borrower;

(xiv) any margin stock;

(xv) any lease, license or other agreement to the extent that a grant of a security interest
therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or create a right of
termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than Holdings or the Issuer or any
Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of
the Uniform Commercial Code;

44


-----

(xvi) those assets as to which the First-Priority Collateral Agent and Prime Borrower
reasonably agree that the cost or other consequence of obtaining such a security
interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the value afforded thereby;

(xvii) any governmental licenses or state or local licenses, franchises, charters and
authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or
authorizations are prohibited or restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable
anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code;

(xviii) any “intent-to-use” applications for trademark or service mark registrations filed pursuant
to Section 1(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051, unless and until an Amendment to
Allege Use or a Statement of Use under Section 1(c) or 1(d) of the Lanham Act has
been filed, (xix) other customary exclusions under applicable local law or in applicable
local jurisdictions set forth in the applicable Security Documents;

(xix) Securitization Assets (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) sold to any Special
Purpose Securitization Subsidiary or otherwise pledged, factored, transferred or sold in
connection with any Permitted Securitization Financing, and any other assets subject to
Liens securing Permitted Securitization Financings;

(xx) any segregated accounts or funds, or any portion thereof, received by Prime Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries as agent on behalf of third parties in accordance with a written
agreement that imposes a duty upon Prime Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries
to collect and remit those funds to such third parties;

(xxi) any equipment or other asset that is subject to certain liens permitted under the First
Lien Credit Agreement or is otherwise subject to a purchase money debt or a
Capitalized Lease Obligation, in each case, as permitted by certain provisions of the
First Lien Credit Agreement, if the contract or other agreement providing for such debt
or Capitalized Lease Obligation prohibits or requires the consent of any Person (other
than Holdings or the Issuer or a Guarantor) as a condition to the creation of any other
security interest on such equipment or asset and, in each case, such prohibition or
requirement is permitted hereunder after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law; and

(xxii) certain other exceptions described in the Security Documents, including the limitation on
stock collateral described below (all such excluded assets referred to as “Excluded
Assets”).

The foregoing excluded property and assets do not secure any of the First Priority Lien
Obligations or the Second Priority Lien Obligations and will not secure the Notes. The security interests
securing the Notes will be _pari passu in priority with any and all security interests at any time granted to_
secure the First Priority Lien Obligations and will also be subject to certain permitted liens. The First
Priority Lien Obligations include the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, as well as certain
hedging obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management services, the ADT Notes
and the First-Priority Notes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the First-Priority Collateral Agent may grant
extensions of time or waiver of the requirement for the creation or perfection of security interests in or the
obtaining of insurance (including title insurance) or surveys with respect to particular assets (including
extensions beyond the Issue Date for the perfection of security interests in the assets of the Issuer or the
Guarantors on such date) where it reasonably determines, in consultation with Prime Borrower, that
perfection or obtaining of such items cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time
or times at which it would otherwise be required by the Indenture or the Security Documents, (B) no
control agreement or control, lockbox or similar arrangement shall be required with respect to any deposit
accounts, securities accounts or commodities accounts, (C) no landlord, mortgagee or bailee waivers

45


-----

shall be required, (D) no foreign-law governed security documents or perfection under foreign law shall be
required and (E) no notice shall be required to be sent to account debtors or other contractual third
parties prior to an Event of Default.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could
share in the Collateral, including additional First Priority Lien Obligations that would be secured on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes and the Guarantees and obligations that would be secured on a junior priority_
basis to the Notes and the Guarantees. Under the Indenture, there are no limitations on the incurrence of
such Indebtedness or other Indebtedness.

**Limitations on Stock Collateral**

The Capital Stock and securities of the Issuer or a Subsidiary that are owned by the Issuer or any
Guarantor will constitute Collateral only to the extent that such Capital Stock and securities can secure
the Notes or the applicable Guarantee, as applicable, without Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act requiring separate financial statements of such Person to be filed with the SEC (or any
other governmental agency). In the event that Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act requires or is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule
or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC
(or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Person due to the fact that
such Person’s Capital Stock or securities secure the Notes or any Guarantee, then the Capital Stock
and/or securities of such Person shall automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral (but only to
the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be
subject to such requirement). In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified,
without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security
interests on the shares of Capital Stock and securities that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of
the Collateral. Since the Notes do not have registration rights, this limitation will not limit the Collateral on
the Issue Date.

In the event that Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended,
modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other
law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Person’s Capital Stock or securities to secure
the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other
governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Person, then the Capital Stock and/or
securities of such Person shall automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral (but only to the
extent that it will not result in such Person being subject to any such financial statement requirement). In
such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of the Trustee or
any holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to subject to the Liens under the Security Documents such
additional Capital Stock and securities, on the terms contemplated herein.

You may not have a perfected security interest in all of the Collateral as of the Issue Date. For
example, some or all of the amendments to the Mortgages needed to cause the Notes and the
Guarantees to be secured thereby may not be in place upon the issuance of the Notes. However, to the
extent that any such instrument or deliverable is required for such perfection, the Issuer will be required to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such instruments and related deliverables within 120
days following the Issue Date or such longer period of time as agreed to by the First Lien Credit
Agreement Agent with respect to perfecting security interests in such Collateral thereunder. See “Risk
Factors—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the
risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**Maintenance of Collateral**

The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that the Issuer will, and will cause each of the
Guarantors to (i) at all times maintain, preserve and protect all property material to the conduct of its
business and keep such property in good repair, working order and condition (other than wear and tear);
(ii) keep its insurable property adequately insured at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers;

46


-----

and (iii) maintain such other insurance, to such extent and against such risks as is customary with
companies in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations.

**After-Acquired Collateral**

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional
security interest upon any property or asset (other than Excluded Assets) to secure any First Priority Lien
Obligations (which include obligations in respect of the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and
the First-Priority Notes), it must concurrently grant a first-priority security interest (subject to certain
permitted liens) in favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes and deliver certain joinder agreements and certificates in respect thereof to
the extent required by the Security Documents.

**Further Assurances**

The Security Documents and the Indenture provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, at
their expense, duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further
agreements, documents, instruments, financing and continuation statements and amendments thereto
and do or cause to be done such further acts as may be necessary or proper to evidence, perfect,
maintain and enforce the security interests and the priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the FirstPriority Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee, and
to otherwise effectuate the provisions or purposes of the Indenture and the Security Documents.

**Security Documents**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the First Lien Credit
Agreement entered into a security agreement and mortgages in connection with the First Lien Credit
Agreement. The trustee for the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes joined such Security Documents
prior to the date hereof. On the Issue Date the Trustee for the Notes will join the security agreement by
executing another first lien secured party consent contemplated thereby and a joinder to the security
agreement and the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and will appoint the First-Priority
Collateral Agent as collateral agent for the Notes.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set
forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom.

**First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent, the trustee of the ADT
Notes and the trustee of the First-Priority Notes are parties to that certain First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2016 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “First
Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”), with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended or
supplemented from time to time without the consent of the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent, the
Trustee, the holders of the Notes or any other First-Priority Secured Party to add other parties holding
First Priority Lien Obligations not prohibited to be incurred under the Indenture, the First Lien Credit
Agreement and the agreements governing any other First Priority Lien Obligations. On the Issue Date,
the Trustee will deliver a joinder to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the
obligations under the Notes.

The First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement governs the relative rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral of the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the holders of the Notes,
the holders of the ADT Notes, the holders of the First-Priority Notes and the holders of any other First
Priority Lien Obligations. Under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the

47


-----

“Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to
foreclose on Common Collateral and take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral, and the
Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations have no right to so direct the
First-Priority Collateral Agent or to take actions with respect to the Common Collateral. The “Applicable
Authorized Representative” is currently the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent. The Trustee for the
holders of the Notes, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, will initially have no rights to
take any action with respect to the Common Collateral under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. The First-Priority Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, at the request of the
First-Priority Collateral Agent, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment)
to any Security Document (including, without limitation, to release any Liens securing any Series of First
Priority Lien Obligations), so long as such amendment is not prohibited by the terms of the documents
governing each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations. The First-Priority Collateral Agent may
additionally enter into any amendment (and, at the request of the First-Priority Collateral Agent, each
Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security Document solely as
such amendment to such Security Document relates to a particular Series of First Priority Lien Obligations
(including, without limitation, to release Liens securing such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations);
provided that any such amendment is in accordance with the documents pursuant to which such Series of
First Priority Lien Obligations was incurred and such amendment does not adversely affect the FirstPriority Secured Parties of any other Series.

The First Lien Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until
the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”).
From and after the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative, with
respect to any Common Collateral, will be the Authorized Representative (the “Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative”) of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (other than obligations under
the First Lien Credit Agreement) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then
outstanding Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to such Common Collateral (the “Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). As of the Issue Date, the trustee for the 2026 Notes will be
the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,” with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the
applicable Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default, under and as defined in the
Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, and
(b) the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written
notice from that Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an Event of
Default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First
Priority Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Lien Obligations of the
Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized
Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of
First Priority Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement
Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any
Common Collateral (1) at any time the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent or the First-Priority Collateral
Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Common
Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such
Common Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to instruct the First-Priority
Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral. The First-Priority
Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any NonControlling Authorized Representative or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the Applicable

48


-----

Authorized Representative), and no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First-Priority
Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the First-Priority
Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to
have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take
possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to
enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the
Common Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the First-Priority
Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with
the Common Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such
Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any Non-Controlling Secured Party may
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the First-Priority Collateral
Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise
by the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured
Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Common Collateral or cause the First-Priority Collateral
Agent to do so. Each other Authorized Representative agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not
accept any Lien on any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other Series
of First Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or
defeasance of the Indenture or the agreement governing such other Series of First Priority Lien
Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each of the First-Priority
Secured Parties also agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest
or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the
First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien/First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien/ First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any
Common Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any
enforcement by the First-Priority Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions thereof, the Liens in
favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First-Priority Secured Parties
upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged.

If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First Priority Lien
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority
Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is
made in respect of any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any
First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the
First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any
sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Common Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or
received by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such
intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution
(subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the paragraph immediately
following) to which the First Priority Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement
shall be applied among the First Priority Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Lien
Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the First-Priority Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party
(other than a First-Priority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable intercreditor
agreements) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of
First Priority Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of
any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (such third party,
an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such
Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Common Collateral or proceeds
to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to which such
impairment exists.

49


-----

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy,
insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any other FirstPriority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions
or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties
may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other
disposition of such Collateral. If any First-Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common
Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of
each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or
payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common
Collateral, proceeds or payment to the First-Priority Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with
the First Lien/ First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in possession,
move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP
Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of
the Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any
Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) agrees that it will raise no objection to any
such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing
Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling
Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or
object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent
that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of
the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with
respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties
(other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are
subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank _pari passu with the Liens_
on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Controlling
Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such
Common Collateral as set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long
as:

(A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all
such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising
after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the
other First-Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the
bankruptcy case,

(B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional
collateral pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or
otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same
priority vis-a-vis the other First-Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien/First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First
Priority Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, and

(D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form
of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement;

provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a
Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Priority Secured

50


-----

Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and
provided, further, that the First-Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to
any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate
protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of
cash collateral.

The First-Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Priority Lien Obligations of any
Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the documents governing each Series of First Priority
Lien Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured,
repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the
priorities set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the
First-Priority Secured Parties of any Series.

**First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent and the Applicable Second Lien Agent are party to the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified, the “First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”), with respect to the Collateral,
which may be amended or supplemented from time to time without the consent of the Trustee, the
holders of the Notes, any other First-Priority Secured Party or any Second Priority Secured Party to add
other parties holding First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations not prohibited to be
incurred under the Indenture, the First Lien Credit Agreement, the agreements governing any other First
Priority Lien Obligations and the agreements governing any Second Priority Lien Obligations. On the
Issue Date, the Trustee will execute and deliver a joinder to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement in the capacity of an other First Lien Obligations Agent in respect of the obligations under the
Notes.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, at any time prior to
the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, the Applicable First Lien Agent and other representatives
of the First Priority Lien Obligations will have the exclusive right to enforce rights and exercise remedies
with respect to the Collateral subject to other provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

So long as the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Applicable
Second Lien Agent will not be permitted to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or
recoupment) with respect to the Collateral even if an Event of Default under the indenture governing the
Second-Priority Notes has occurred and the Second-Priority Notes have been accelerated, except the
Applicable Second Lien Agent may take certain specified permitted remedies, including to:

(a) take certain protective measures described in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement,

(b) exercise rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral after a period of 180 days has
elapsed since the delivery of the notice of the acceleration of the applicable Second
Priority Lien Obligations to the Applicable First Lien Agent, if no holder of First Priority
Lien Obligations is diligently pursuing the enforcement or exercise of rights or remedies
with respect to a material portion of Collateral or requested a relief of any stay to enable
commencement of such exercise, any such acceleration has not been rescinded and
neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor is then a debtor in any insolvency proceeding,

(c) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any
motion, claim, adversary proceeding, or other pleading made by any Person objecting to
or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Second Lien
Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

51


-----

(d) file any pleadings, objections motions, or agreements that assert rights or interests
available to unsecured creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor arising under either any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not
inconsistent with or prohibited by the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or applicable law (including the bankruptcy laws of an applicable
jurisdiction), or

(e) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof
of claim, make other filings and make any arguments, obligations, and motions
(including in support of or opposition to, as applicable, the confirmation or approval of
any plan of reorganization) that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain limited rights, the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that it will not take any
action that would hinder or interfere with any exercise of remedies undertaken by any holder of First
Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Collateral and waived any and all rights it or any such Second
Lien Secured Party may have as a junior lien creditor or otherwise to object to the manner in which any
holder of First Priority Lien Obligations seeks to enforce or collect the First Priority Lien Obligations or the
Liens granted to secure any First Priority Lien Obligations, regardless of whether any action or failure to
act by such holder is adverse to the interests of the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time the
Issuer or a Guarantor or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations delivers notice to the Applicable
Second Lien Agent that any specified Collateral held by such Person (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary
thereof) is disposed of (other than to the Issuer or a Guarantor) (i) by the owner of such Collateral in a
transaction not prohibited under the documents governing First Priority Lien Obligations and Second
Priority Lien Obligations or (ii) during the existence of any Event of Default under (and as defined in) the
First Lien Credit Agreement or any applicable documents governing other First Priority Lien Obligations in
connection with any enforcement action, exercise of rights or remedies or to the extent that the Applicable
First Lien Agent has consented to such disposition, then the Liens securing the Second Priority Lien
Obligations upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and upon, but only to
the extent, such Liens on such Collateral securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are released and
discharged.

In addition, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the
Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, except as provided in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (1) the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations and the First-Priority Collateral Agent shall
have the exclusive right to make determinations regarding the release of Collateral without the consent of
any Second Lien Secured Parties, (2) the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be
supplemented, without the consent of the Applicable Second Lien Agent or the holders of any Second
Priority Lien Obligations, to add additional secured creditors holding other First Priority Lien Obligations
and other Second Priority Lien Obligations so long as such other First Priority Lien Obligations or other
Second Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable, are not prohibited by the provisions of the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the Indenture, the documents governing any other First Priority Lien Obligations or the
documents governing any Second Priority Lien Obligations and (3) in the event the holders of the First
Priority Lien Obligations change, waive, modify or vary the Security Documents, such modification will
automatically apply to the comparable provisions of the security documents governing the Second Priority
Lien Obligations without the consent of any holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations, provided that
any such change, waiver or modification does not materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of
the Second Priority Lien Obligations to a greater extent than the holders of the First Priority Lien
Obligations in a like or similar manner.

In addition if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding,
the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of any Second Priority Lien Obligations agreed that:

(1) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the First-Priority

52


-----

Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use, sale or lease of cash collateral or to permit
the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing, then they will not object to, or
support any objection to or otherwise contest, and will be deemed to have consented to,
such use, sale or lease of such cash collateral and DIP Financing and will not request
adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent
permitted by clause 7 below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the First Priority Lien
Obligations are subordinated or _pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its_
Liens in the Collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto,
including any “carve-out” from the Collateral granting administrative priority status or Lien
priority to secure the payment of fees and expenses of the United States Trustee or
professionals retained by any debtor or creditors’ committee agreed to by the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or the other holders of First Priority Lien Obligations) and to any
adequate protection Liens granted to the First-Priority Collateral Agent, on the same
basis as the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated to the
Liens securing the DIP Financing; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of the
DIP Financing does not exceed the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of the First Priority
Lien Obligations (after taking into account any “roll-up” thereof) and (2) an amount equal
to 100% of the aggregate commitments (whether drawn or undrawn) under such then
existing revolving credit facilities, in each case determined as of the commencement of
such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

(2) they will raise no objection to, and will not support any objection to or otherwise contest,
any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or
enforcement in respect of any First Priority Lien Obligations made by the First-Priority
Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations;

(3) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any
lawful exercise by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien
Obligations of the right to credit bid the First Priority Lien Obligations under Section
363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law) or at any sale in foreclosure or in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding of the Collateral or other collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations;

(4) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any
other request for judicial relief made in any court by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or
any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any
Lien on any Collateral or other Collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations;

(5) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any
order relating to a sale of any Collateral of the Issuer or Guarantor for which the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations has consented
that provides, to the extent that the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens
securing the First Priority Lien Obligations and the Second Priority Lien Obligations will
attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the
First Priority Lien Obligations do relate to the Liens securing the Second Priority Lien
Obligations in accordance with the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
provided that the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien
Obligations may assert any objection to the proposed bidding or related sale procedures
to be utilized in connection with a sale or disposition that could be asserted by an
unsecured creditor in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(6) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they will not (i) seek
relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding in respect of the Collateral or any other collateral securing any First Priority
Lien Obligations without the prior written consent of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or
the required lenders under each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations or are otherwise

53


-----

set forth in the First-Lien/Second-Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) oppose the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations from seeking
relief from the automatic stay or any other stay;

(7) none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (a) any request by
the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations for
adequate protection in any form or (b) any objection by the First-Priority Collateral Agent
or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to any motion, relief, action or proceeding
based on the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s or the holders of First Priority Lien
Obligations’ claiming a lack of adequate protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of First Priority Lien
Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien
on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim in
connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or
Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the Applicable Second Lien
Agent and any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations (A) may seek or request
adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral
and/or a superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), which Lien or superpriority
claim is junior and subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection
for, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations and such DIP
Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens
securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to the
Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under
the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (B) will not seek or request,
without the consent of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or as otherwise set forth in the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, adequate protection in any other form,
and (ii) in the event that the Applicable Second Lien Agent or any holder of Second
Priority Lien Obligations seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate
protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or
a superpriority administrative claim, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that
the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall also be granted a senior Lien on
such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the
applicable First Priority Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing and/or a
superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), and that any Lien on such additional
or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Second
Priority Lien Obligations and/or a superpriority claim shall be junior and subordinated to
the Liens on such collateral securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority
Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and
any other Liens granted to the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations as adequate
protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing, and the claims with respect
to, the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to such Liens
securing, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations are granted
adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Applicable Second
Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations shall not be prohibited
from seeking and accepting adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount
of current post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as
applicable), subject to the right of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of
First Priority Lien Obligations to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees
and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Applicable Second Lien Agent
and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations; and

(8) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they (i) will not assert
or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar

54


-----

provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on a parity with the
Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or
disposing of any Collateral or other collateral, and (ii) will waive any claim it may have
arising out of the election by any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations of the application
of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other
applicable bankruptcy law).

In addition, under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of Second
Priority Lien Obligations may support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization proposed in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding (and shall be deemed to have voted to reject any such plan) unless it
(a) pays off, in cash in full, all First Priority Lien Obligations, (b) is accepted by the class of holders of First
Priority Lien Obligations voting thereon in accordance with Section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any
similar provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law), or (c) otherwise provides the holders of First
Priority Lien Obligations with the value of the Collateral in cash or otherwise, prior to any payment or
distribution on account of the Second Priority Lien Obligations (subject to a certain other provision of the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement).

The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the parties thereto agree
that (i) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents and the security documents governing the
Second Priority Lien Obligations constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens and (ii) because of
their differing rights in the Collateral, the Second Priority Lien Obligations must be separately classified
from the First Priority Lien Obligations in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring
plan proposed or confirmed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The parties thereto further agree
that regardless of whether any claim for interest, fees, costs, or expenses that accrue after the
commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding is allowed or allowable, the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement expressly is intended to include and does include the “rule of explicitness” in
that the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement expressly entitles the First-Priority Collateral
Agent and the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations with the right to receive, in respect of the First
Priority Lien Obligations, payment from the Collateral of all such post-petition claims through distributions
made therefrom pursuant to the provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, even if
any such post-petition claims are not allowed or allowable against the bankruptcy estate of the Issuer or
any Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law. If it is held that the
claims of the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations and the holders of the Second Priority Lien
Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of
senior and junior secured claims), then the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to the amounts distributed to them from, or in respect of, the Collateral in respect of
principal, prepetition interest, and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition claims,
irrespective of whether any claim for such amounts is allowed or allowable in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, before any distribution from, or in respect of, any Collateral is made in respect of
the claims held by the Second Lien Secured Parties, with the holders of the Second Lien Secured Parties
acknowledging and agreeing in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement to turn over to the
holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the
Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of the foregoing, even if such turnover has the
effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the Second Lien Secured Parties.

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the automatic release of property and other assets
included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes Obligations under any one or more of the
following circumstances or any applicable circumstance as provided in the First Lien/First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement or the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement:

(1) in respect of the property and assets of a Guarantor, upon the consummation of any
transaction permitted by the Indenture as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be
a Subsidiary of Prime Borrower or otherwise ceases to be a pledgor under the Security
Documents;

55


-----

(2) to enable the Issuer or any Guarantor to consummate the disposition of such property or
assets to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor to the extent not prohibited under
the Indenture;

(3) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of
the Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary;

(4) in respect of the property or assets of the Issuer, upon the release or discharge of the
Issuer’s Notes Obligations in accordance with the Indenture;

(5) in respect of the property and assets of a Guarantor, upon the release or discharge of the
Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the Indenture;

(6) in respect of any property and assets that are or become Excluded Assets pursuant to a
transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

(7) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or
discharge of the pledge granted by such Subsidiary Guarantor to secure the
obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness the
guarantee in respect of which resulted in the obligation to become a Subsidiary
Guarantor with respect to the Notes; and

(8) upon any sale or other transfer by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any Collateral that is
permitted under the Indenture to any Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor
(including in connection with a condemnation or casualty event), or upon the
effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted by the
Security Documents in any Collateral pursuant to the Indenture.

The first priority security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes will also be released upon (i)
payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest,
if any) on, the Notes and all other obligations under the Indenture and the Security Documents that are
due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including
additional interest, if any) with respect to the Notes, are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture as described below under “—Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations”) or (ii)
a discharge or defeasance of the Notes under the Indenture as described below under “—Defeasance
and Discharge of Obligations.”

**Guarantees**

Prime Borrower and each of its direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are
Domestic Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer or an Excluded Subsidiary) and that are borrowers or
guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes or any other
First Priority Lien Obligations (such Subsidiaries of Prime Borrower, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) will
jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a senior basis the performance and
punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the
Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest
on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such
Guarantors being herein called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Guaranteed Obligations of all
Guarantors will be secured by first-priority security interests (subject to certain permitted liens) in the
Collateral owned by such Guarantor. The Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated
above, any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee
in enforcing any rights under the Guarantees.

Each Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor,

56


-----

voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes— Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the Notes and
guarantees and the related security interests, and require holders of Notes to return payments received.”

After the Issue Date, the Issuer will cause any Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of Prime
Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) that incurs or guarantees
Indebtedness of Prime Borrower, the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, including Indebtedness
under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes or any other First Priority
Lien Obligations to execute and deliver to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture pursuant to which
such Person will guarantee payment of the Notes on the same senior secured basis and (ii) joinders to or
new Security Documents and take all actions required by the Security Documents to perfect the Liens
created thereunder.

Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment in
full of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Guarantor and its
successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

Each Person’s Guarantee will be automatically released upon any of the following:

(1) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital
Stock (including any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer following which the
applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of Prime Borrower)
of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, disposition, exchange or other
transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the Indenture;

(2) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or such
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the
Indebtedness or guarantee of the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness
which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes;

(4) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations” or if the Issuer’s
obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; and

(5) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Subsidiary of Prime Borrower as a result of
any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest in favor of the First Priority Lien
Obligations or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof.

    - The Issuer will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes;

    - The Issuer will maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented or surrendered
for payment; and

    - The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee on or before March 31 of each year a certificate
executed by the principal executive, financial or accounting officer of the Issuer as to such
officer’s knowledge of the Issuer’s compliance with all covenants and agreements under the
Indenture required to be complied with by the Issuer.

The following additional covenants shall apply with respect to the Notes so long as any Notes
remain outstanding (but subject to defeasance with respect to the Notes, as provided in the Indenture):

**Reports**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee and, upon request, to
beneficial owners of such Notes a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, annual reports of the Reporting Entity (as defined below) for such
fiscal year containing the information that would have been required to be contained in
an annual report on Form 10-K (or any successor or comparable form) if the Reporting
Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to the extent
permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, quarterly reports of the Reporting Entity for such fiscal quarter
containing the information that would have been required to be contained in a quarterly
report on Form 10-Q (or any successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had
been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to the extent permitted to be
excluded by the SEC; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for filing
current reports on Form 8-K, current reports of the Reporting Entity containing
substantially all of the information that would be required to be filed in a Current Report
on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on the Issue Date pursuant to Sections 1, 2 and 4,
Items 5.01, 5.02(a)–(d) (other than compensation information), 5.03(b) and Item 9.01
(only to the extent relating to any of the foregoing) of Form 8-K if the Reporting Entity
had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that no
such current reports will be required to be furnished if the Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material
to the holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of the
Issuer and its Affiliates, taken as a whole.

If at any time the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer has made a good faith
determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to a public offering of such
Person’s Capital Stock, the Issuer will not be required to disclose any information or take any actions that,
in the good faith view of the Issuer, would violate the securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or
otherwise have an adverse effect on such public offering.

58


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Issuer (and the applicable Reporting Entity) will not be
required to furnish any information, certificates or reports that would otherwise be required by (i) Section
302 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, or
(ii) Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-generally accepted
accounting principles financial measures contained therein, (b) such reports will not be required to contain
financial information required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or include any
exhibits or certifications required by Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K (or any such successor or
comparable forms) or related rules under Regulation S-K and (c) such reports shall be subject to
exceptions and exclusions consistent with the presentation of financial and other information in the
offering memorandum for the Notes (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) or
otherwise consistent with the Indenture and shall not be required to present compensation or beneficial
ownership information.

The financial statements, information and other documents required to be provided as described
above, may be those of (i) the Issuer, (ii) Prime Borrower or (iii) any direct or indirect parent of Prime
Borrower (any such entity described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Reporting Entity”), so long as, in the case
of (iii), either (a) such direct or indirect parent of Prime Borrower will not conduct, transact or otherwise
engage, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage, in any business or operations other than its
direct or indirect ownership of all of the Equity Interests in, and its management of Prime Borrower or (b)
such direct or indirect parent of Prime Borrower is or becomes a guarantor of the Notes; provided, that, if
the financial information so furnished relates to such direct or indirect parent of Prime Borrower pursuant
to (iii)(a) above, the same is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the quantitative
differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating
to Prime Borrower and the Guarantors of the Notes on a standalone but consolidated basis, on the other
hand.

In addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuer will make available to the
holders, prospective investors and securities analysts the information required to be provided pursuant to
clauses (1), (2) or (3) of the first paragraph above, by posting such information to the website of the
Issuer (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) or on IntraLinks or any comparable
online data system or website.

The Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls,
beginning with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the operative date of the Indenture, for all holders
and securities analysts to discuss such financial information no later than ten Business Days after the
distribution of such information required by this covenant, and prior to the date of each such conference
call, the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer will announce the time and date of such
conference call and either include all information necessary to access the call in such announcement or
inform the holders of Notes, prospective investors and securities analysts how they can obtain such
information, including, without limitation, the applicable password or other login information (if applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred
to above to the Trustee and holders if the Issuer or a Reporting Entity has filed such reports with the SEC
via the EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such reports are publicly available. In
addition, the requirements of this covenant shall be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would
be required to be provided to the holders on the Issuer’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer).

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes
only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained
therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s or Prime Borrower’s
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on
Officers’ Certificates).

Prime Borrower will not merge or consolidate with any other Person, consummate a Delaware
LLC Division (whether or not Prime Borrower is the surviving Person or successor, as applicable) or sell
or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any person, unless:

acquires by sale or conveyance substantially all the assets of Prime Borrower, shall
expressly assume all of the obligations of Prime Borrower under the Indenture; and

(2) no Event of Default (as defined below) and no event that, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would become an Event of Default shall be continuing immediately after such
merger, Delaware LLC Division or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance.

The Issuer will not merge or consolidate with any other Person or consummate a Delaware LLC
Division (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person or successor, as applicable), unless:

### (1) (a) the Issuer shall be the continuing entity, or (b) the successor entity (A) shall expressly
assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, (B) is an entity treated as
a “corporation” for U.S. tax purposes and obtains either (x) an opinion, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, of tax counsel of recognized standing
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, which counsel shall include Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP or (y) a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, in either
case to the effect that such merger, Delaware LLC Division or consolidation, or such sale
or conveyance, will not result in an exchange of the Notes for new debt instruments for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and (C) if such entity is not organized under the laws of
the United States or any state of the United States, then it shall expressly undertake
obligations with respect to the Notes comparable to those initially undertaken by the
Issuer as described under “Payment of Additional Amounts”; provided, however, that no
Additional Amounts (defined under “Payment of Additional Amounts”) shall be paid on
account of any taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) and any
current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof;
and

Indenture relating to such proposed transaction have been complied with, and that such supplemental
indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such continuing or successor entity.

**Limitations on Liens**

The Issuer will not permit any Principal Subsidiary (as defined below) to issue, assume or
guarantee any Indebtedness that is secured by a lien upon any property that at the time of such issuance,
assumption or guarantee constitutes a Principal Property (as defined below), or any shares of stock of or
Indebtedness issued by any Principal Subsidiary (other than Prime Borrower), whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, without effectively providing that, for so long as such lien shall continue in existence
with respect to such secured Indebtedness, the Notes (together with, if the Issuer shall so determine, any
other Indebtedness of the Issuer ranking equally with the Notes, it being understood that for purposes
hereof, Indebtedness which is secured by a lien and Indebtedness which is not so secured shall not,

60


-----

solely by reason of such lien, be deemed to be of different ranking) are equally and ratably secured by a
lien ranking ratably with or equal to (or at the Issuer’s option prior to) such secured Indebtedness;

    - liens existing on the date the Notes are first issued;

    - liens securing the Notes Obligations in respect of the initial Notes;

a Principal Subsidiary, or to secure any Indebtedness incurred, assumed or guaranteed by a
Principal Subsidiary for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price of such
Principal Property or improvements or construction thereon, which Indebtedness is incurred,
assumed or guaranteed prior to, at the time of or within one year after such acquisition, or in
the case of real property, completion of such improvement or construction or commencement
of full operation of such property, whichever is later; provided, however, that in the case of
any such acquisition, construction or improvement, the lien shall not apply to any Principal
Property theretofore owned by a Principal Subsidiary, other than the Principal Property so
acquired, constructed or improved, and accessions thereto and improvements and
replacements thereof and the proceeds of the foregoing;

    - liens securing Indebtedness owing by any Principal Subsidiary to Prime Borrower or a
Subsidiary thereof;

    - liens in favor of the United States or any State thereof, or any department, agency or

Indebtedness incurred or guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of the

arrangement pertaining to unemployment insurance, old age pensions, social security or
similar matters, or to secure surety, performance, appeal or customs bonds to which any
Principal Subsidiary is a party, or in litigation or other proceedings in connection with the
matters heretofore referred to in this clause, such as interpleader proceedings, and other
similar pledges, liens or deposits made or incurred in the ordinary course of business;

    - liens created by or resulting from any litigation or other proceeding that is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings, including liens arising out of judgments or awards

61


-----

against any Principal Subsidiary with respect to which such Principal Subsidiary in good faith
is prosecuting an appeal or proceedings for review or for which the time to make an appeal
has not yet expired; or final unappealable judgment liens which are satisfied within 15 days of
the date of judgment; or liens incurred by any Principal Subsidiary for the purpose of
obtaining a stay or discharge in the course of any litigation or other proceeding to which such

Directors of Prime Borrower, do not materially impair the use of such assets in the operation
of the business of such Principal Subsidiary or the value of such Principal Property for the
purposes of such business;

forward, future and option transactions, entered into in the ordinary course of business;

to, the creation or assumption of any such lien, the aggregate amount of all outstanding
Indebtedness of the Principal Subsidiaries, without duplication, secured by all such liens not
so permitted by the foregoing bullets, inclusive, together with the Attributable Debt in respect
of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions permitted by the first bullet under “Limitation on Sale
and Lease-Back Transactions” below do not exceed the greater of $100,000,000 and 10% of
Consolidated Net Worth (as defined below); and

    - any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements)
in whole or in part, of any lien referred to in the foregoing bullets inclusive; provided, however,
that the principal amount of Indebtedness secured thereby unless otherwise excepted under
the foregoing bullets shall not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness so secured at the
time of such extension, renewal or replacement, and that such extension, renewal or
replacement shall be limited to all or a part of the assets, or any replacements therefor, that
secured the lien so extended, renewed or replaced, plus improvements and construction on
real property.

**Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions**

The Issuer will not permit any Principal Subsidiary to enter into any Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction unless:

    - such Principal Subsidiary, at the time of entering into a Sale and Lease-Back Transaction,
would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a lien on the Principal Property to be
leased in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and
Lease-Back Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to the
subsection “Limitations on Liens” above; or

    - the direct or indirect proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property to be leased are at least
equal to the fair value of such Principal Property, as determined by Prime Borrower’s Board
of Directors, and an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the property or assets
so leased is applied, within 180 days of the effective date of any such Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction, to the purchase or acquisition, or, in the case of real property, commencement
of the construction of property or assets or to the retirement (other than at maturity or
pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund or mandatory redemption provision) of the Notes, or of

62


-----

Funded Indebtedness of the Issuer, Prime Borrower or a consolidated Subsidiary ranking on
a parity with or senior to the Notes; provided that there shall be credited to the amount of net
proceeds required to be applied pursuant to this provision an amount equal to the sum of (i)
the principal amount of the Notes delivered within 180 days of the effective date of such Sale
and Lease-Back Transaction to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation and (ii) the
principal amount of other Funded Indebtedness voluntarily retired by the Issuer, Prime
Borrower or a consolidated Subsidiary within such 180-day period, excluding retirements of
the Notes and other Funded Indebtedness as a result of conversions or pursuant to
mandatory sinking fund or mandatory prepayment provisions.

**Events of Default**

With respect to a particular series of Notes, an “Event of Default” will mean any one or more of
the following events that has occurred and is continuing:

    - default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Notes of such series as
and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a
period of 30 days;

    - default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of or premium, if any, on any of the
Notes of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity,
upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise;

    - default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the Issuer in respect
of the Notes of such series (other than a default or breach that is specifically dealt with
elsewhere), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after the date
on which there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Issuer by the Trustee or
to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of such series issued under the Indenture affected thereby, a written
notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that the
notice is a “Notice of Default” under the Indenture;

    - a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of
the Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian,
trustee or sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or for any substantial part of its property
or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain
unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days;

    - the Issuer shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an
involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment of or taking possession
by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator or similar official of the
Issuer or for any substantial part of its property, or make any general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; or

    - any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board
of Directors under which the Notes of such series is issued or in the form of security for such
series.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing in respect of the Notes of such
series, in each and every case, unless the principal of all the Notes of such series shall have already
become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding, by notice in writing to the Issuer and, if given by

63


-----

such holders, to the Trustee may declare the unpaid principal of all the Notes of that series to be due and
payable immediately.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes of any series, by written notice
to the Issuer and the Trustee may waive any existing default in the performance of any of the covenants
contained in the Indenture or established with respect to such series and its consequences, except a
default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Notes of that series as
and when the same shall become due by the terms of such Notes. Upon any such waiver, the default
covered thereby and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes
of the Indenture.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such
series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with the
Indenture or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of securities of any other outstanding series of
debt securities, it being expressly understood that the Trustee shall not have an affirmative duty to
ascertain whether such action is prejudicial. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the
proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

No holder of Notes of any series shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law under the Indenture or to appoint a receiver or trustee, or to seek any other remedies
under the Indenture unless:

    - such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default
and the continuance thereof specifying such Event of Default;

    - the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series
then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action,
suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee;

    - such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity and security
reasonably satisfactory to it as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby;

    - the Trustee, for 60 days after its receipt of such written notice, request and offer of indemnity
and security reasonably satisfactory to it, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or
proceeding; and

    - during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of that
series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.

The right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on
such security or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment shall not be impaired or affected
without the consent of such holder.

The following additional event shall be established and shall constitute an “Event of Default”
under the Indenture with respect to a series of the Notes so long as any of the Notes of such series
remain outstanding:

    - an event of default shall happen and be continuing with respect to Prime Borrower’s or the
Issuer’s Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) under
any indenture or other instrument evidencing or under which Prime Borrower or the Issuer
shall have a principal amount outstanding (such amount with respect to original issue

64


-----

discount bonds or zero coupon notes, bonds or debentures or similar securities based on the
accreted amount determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles and as of the date of the most recently prepared consolidated balance sheet of
Prime Borrower or the Issuer, as applicable) in excess of $100,000,000, and such event of
default shall involve the failure to pay the principal of such Indebtedness on the final maturity
date thereof after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or such
Indebtedness shall have been accelerated so that the same shall have become due and
payable prior to the date on which the same would otherwise have become due and payable,
and such acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled within ten Business Days after
notice thereof shall have been given by the Trustee to the Issuer or by the holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series to the Trustee and
the Issuer.

However, this additional Event of Default is subject to the following:

        - if such event of default under such indenture or instrument shall be remedied or
cured by Prime Borrower or the Issuer, as applicable, or waived by the requisite
holders of such Indebtedness, then the event of default under the Indenture by
reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or
waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the holders;
and

        - subject to certain duties, responsibilities and rights of the Trustee under the
Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such event of
default unless written notice thereof shall have been given to the Trustee by the
Issuer, by the holder or an agent of the holder of any such Indebtedness, by the
Trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such default
shall have occurred, or by the holders of not less than 25% in the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Notes of such series.

**Modification of the Indenture and the Security Documents**

The Trustee or the collateral agent, as applicable, and the Issuer may from time to time and at
any time amend the Indenture and the Security Documents (subject to the provisions of the Security
Documents) or enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of
any holders of any series of Notes for one or more of the following purposes:

    - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture or Security Documents;

    - to add an additional obligor on the debt securities or to add a guarantor of any outstanding
debt securities or to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or Prime
Borrower, or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor Person of the
covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer or Prime Borrower, as applicable,
pursuant to provisions in the Indenture concerning consolidation, merger, Delaware LLC
Division, or sale of assets;

    - to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt
securities;

    - to add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of the holders of any outstanding debt
securities issued under the Indenture or to surrender any of the Issuer’s rights or powers
under the Indenture;

    - to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the holders of any outstanding debt
securities issued under the Indenture;

65


-----

    - to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture, provided that any such change
or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding debt securities
created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit
of such provision;

    - to secure the Notes or any guarantee thereof;

    - to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of
outstanding debt securities in any material respect;

    - to issue additional debt securities, including additional notes (see “—Additional Notes”);
provided that such additional debt securities have the same terms as, and are deemed part of
the same securities as, the applicable debt securities to the extent required under the
Indenture; or

    - to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee with
respect to the debt securities and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture
as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust by more than
one trustee.

In addition, under the Indenture, with the written consent of the holders of not less than a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each series at the time outstanding that is affected,
the Issuer when authorized by board resolutions, and the Trustee, from time to time and at any time may
amend the Indenture and the Security Documents (subject to the provisions of the Security Documents)
or enter into an indenture or indentures to supplement the Indenture. However, the following changes
may only be made with the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected:

    - extend a fixed maturity of or any installment of principal of any debt securities of any series or
reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the amount of principal of any original issue
discount security that would be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the
maturity thereof;

    - reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any debt security of any
series;

    - reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt security;

    - make any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt security;

    - impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the fixed
maturity thereof or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date; or

    - reduce the percentage of debt securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any
such supplemental indenture or indentures.

A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant, Event of Default or other
provision of the Indenture that has been expressly included solely for the benefit of one or more particular
series of securities, if any, or which modifies the rights of the holders of securities of such series with
respect to such covenant, Event of Default or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights
under the Indenture of the holders of securities of any other series.

It will not be necessary for the consent of the holders to approve the particular form of any
proposed supplement, amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of it.

66


-----

**Information Concerning the Trustee**

In case an Event of Default with respect to the securities of a series has occurred (that has not
been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to securities of that series such of the
rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her
own affairs. None of the provisions contained in the Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the
exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of
such funds or liability is not assured to it under the terms of the Indenture or indemnity and security
reasonably satisfactory to it against such risk is not assured.

The Trustee may resign with respect to one or more series of debt securities by giving a written
notice to the Issuer and to the holders that series of debt securities. The holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of a particular series may remove the Trustee by notifying the
Issuer and the Trustee. The Issuer may remove the Trustee if:

    - the Trustee has or acquires a “conflicting interest,” within the meaning of Section 310(b) of
the TIA, and fails to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the TIA;

    - the Trustee fails to comply with the eligibility requirements provided in an Indenture and fails
to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any such holder in accordance with
the Indenture; or

    - the Trustee becomes incapable of acting, or is adjudged to be bankrupt or insolvent, or
commences a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property
is appointed or consented to, or any public officer takes charge or control of the Trustee or of
its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if the office of the Trustee is otherwise vacant, the Issuer
will appoint a successor trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee shall become
effective only upon the successor trustee’s acceptance of the appointment as provided in the Indenture.

**Payment and Paying Agents**

The interest installment on any security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided
for, on the fixed date on which an installment of interest with respect to securities of that series is due and
payable, shall be paid to the Person in whose name such security (or one or more predecessor
securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment.

The Issuer, upon written notice to the Trustee, may appoint one or more paying agents, other
than the Trustee, for the Notes. The Notes will be surrendered for payment at the office of the paying
agents designated by the Issuer. If the Issuer does not designate such an office, the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee will serve as the office of the paying agent for series. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as paying agent upon written notice to the Trustee.

All funds paid by the Issuer to a paying agent or the Trustee for the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes which remains unclaimed for at least one year after such
principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable will be repaid to the Issuer and the
holder of the Notes thereafter may look only to the Issuer for payment thereof.

67


-----

**Governing Law**

THE INDENTURE AND ANY DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED THEREUNDER SHALL BE DEEMED
TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND
FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD
REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW.

**Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations**

The Issuer’s obligations with respect to any series of the Notes will be discharged and shall cease
to be of further effect upon compliance with the conditions under the caption “Covenant Defeasance” if,
with respect to all Notes of that particular series that have not been previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation or that have not become due and payable as described below, such Notes have been paid
by the Issuer by depositing irrevocably with the Trustee, in trust, funds or governmental obligations, or a
combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of certified public
accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption all such outstanding Notes of that series, such deposit
to include:

    - principal;

    - premium, if any;

    - interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the
case may be; and

    - all other payments due under the terms of the Indenture with respect to the debt securities of
such series.

Notwithstanding the above, the Issuer may not be discharged from the following obligations,
which will survive until such date of maturity or the redemption date for the applicable series of notes:

    - to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes of such series;

    - to execute and authenticate the Notes;

    - to replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes; and

    - to appoint new trustees as required.

The Issuer also may not be discharged from the following obligations which will survive the
satisfaction and discharge of the applicable series of Notes:

    - to compensate and reimburse the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

    - to receive unclaimed payments held by the Trustee for at least one year after the date upon
which the principal, if any, or interest on the Notes shall have respectively come due and
payable and remit those payments to the holders if required; and

    - to withhold or deduct taxes as provided in the Indenture.

68


-----

**Covenant Defeasance**

Upon compliance with specified conditions, the Issuer will not be required to comply with some
covenants contained in the Indenture, and any omission to comply with the obligations will not constitute
a default or Event of Default relating to the applicable series of Notes, or, if applicable, the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to the applicable series of Notes will be discharged. These conditions are:

  - The Issuer or a Guarantor irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee or, at the option of the
Trustee, with a trustee satisfactory to the Trustee and the Issuer or a Guarantor under the terms
of an irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, funds or
governmental obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of certified public accountants, to pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the outstanding securities of such series to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and to
pay all other amounts payable by it under the Indenture, provided that (A) the Trustee of the
irrevocable trust shall have been irrevocably instructed to pay such funds or the proceeds of such
governmental obligations to the Trustee and (B) the Trustee shall have been irrevocably
instructed to apply such funds or the proceeds of such governmental obligations to the payment
of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the securities of such series;

  - The Issuer or a Guarantor delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions
precedent specified herein relating to defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be,
have been complied with, and an opinion of counsel to the same effect;

  - No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become such an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, on the date of such deposit;

  - The Issuer or a Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel or a ruling
received from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the holders of the securities of such
series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the
Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s exercise of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. Federal income tax in the same amount and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such election had not been exercised;

  - such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not (i) cause the Trustee to have a conflicting
interest for purposes of the TIA with respect to any securities or (ii) result in the trust arising from
such deposit to constitute, unless it is registered as such, a regulated investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

  - such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or
substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Issuer or a Guarantor
pursuant to the Indenture.

**Additional Notes**

We may, without the consent of the then existing holders of the Notes of a series, “re-open” the
series and issue additional notes, which additional notes will have the same terms as the Notes offered
hereby except for the issue price, issue date and under some circumstances, the first interest payment
date. Additional notes issued in this manner will form a single series with the applicable series of the
Notes offered hereby. We may also issue additional notes of a new series. All additional notes issued
under the Indenture will be considered “Notes” for purposes thereof, with such changes as the context
may imply.

69


-----

**Optional Redemption**

The Notes will be subject to redemption at the Issuer’s option on any date prior to the maturity
date, in whole or from time to time in part, in $1,000 increments (provided that any remaining principal
amount thereof shall be at least the minimum authorized denomination thereof).

Prior to August 1, 2028 (twelve months prior to the maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes
will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent and delivered to the Trustee in
writing, the sum of the present values of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and
the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon due on any date after the date of redemption to
and including the Par Call Date (excluding the portion of interest that will be accrued and unpaid to and
including the date of redemption), in each case, discounted from their scheduled date of payment to the
date of redemption (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted
Redemption Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but
excluding, the date of redemption.

On or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

**_Optional Redemption Definitions_**

“Adjusted Redemption Treasury Rate,” with respect to any date of redemption, means the rate
equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a 30/360 day count basis) yield to
maturity of the Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable
Redemption Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable
Redemption Treasury Price for such date of redemption.

“Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by
the Quotation Agent as being the most recently issued United States Treasury note or bond as displayed
by Bloomberg LP (or any successor service) on screens PXI through PX8 (or any other screens as may
replace such screens on such service) that has a remaining term comparable to the period from such
date of redemption to the Par Call Date.

“Comparable Redemption Treasury Price,” with respect to any date of redemption, means (i) the
average of the Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after
excluding the highest and lowest such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (unless there
is more than one highest or lowest quotation, in which case only one such highest and/or lowest quotation
shall be excluded), or (ii) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Redemption Reference
Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.

“Quotation Agent” means a Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer appointed as such agent by
the Issuer.

“Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer” means four primary U.S. government securities dealers
in the United States selected by the Issuer.

“Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations,” with respect to each Redemption
Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, means the average, as determined by the
Quotation Agent, of the bid and offer prices at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, for the Comparable
Redemption Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) for
settlement on the date of redemption quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Redemption
Reference Treasury Dealer on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.

70


-----

**Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes**

The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes under the following conditions:

  - If there is an amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any
political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to tax (a “Taxing Jurisdiction”), or any
change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, including any action taken by a
taxing authority or a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction, regardless of whether such
action or such holding is with respect to the Issuer;

  - As a result of such amendment or change, the Issuer becomes, or there is a material probability
that the Issuer will become, obligated to pay Additional Amounts, as defined below in “Payment of
Additional Amounts,” on the next payment date with respect to debt securities of such series;

  - The obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided through the Issuer’s commercially
reasonable measures;

  - The Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

    - a certificate of the Issuer stating that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be
avoided by the Issuer taking commercially reasonable measures available to it; and

    - a written opinion of independent legal counsel to the Issuer of recognized standing to the
effect that the Issuer has, or there is a material probability that it will become obligated, to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a change, amendment, official interpretation or application
described above and that the Issuer cannot avoid the payment of such Additional Amounts by
taking commercially reasonable measures available to it; and

    - following the delivery of the certificate and opinion described in the previous bullet point, the
Issuer provides notice of redemption not less than 30 days, but not more than 90 days, prior
to the date of redemption. The notice of redemption cannot be given more than 90 days
before the earliest date on which the Issuer would be otherwise required to pay Additional
Amounts, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must still be in effect when the notice
is given.

Upon the occurrence of each of the bullet points above, the Issuer may redeem the debt
securities of such series at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

**Notice of Redemption**

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 90 days before the
redemption date to the Trustee and each holder of notes of a series to be redeemed. If the Issuer elects
to redeem a portion but not all of the Notes, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed in
accordance with a method determined by the Issuer and the rules and procedures of DTC, in such
manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any.

Interest on such Notes or portions of Notes will cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for
redemption, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with
respect to any such security or portion thereof.

If any date of redemption of any security is not a Business Day, then payment of principal and
interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on
the nominal date of redemption and no interest will accrue for the period after such nominal date.

71


-----

Notice of any redemption upon any corporate transaction or other event (including any equity

offering, incurrence of indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction) may be given prior to the
completion thereof, and any redemption or notice thereof may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a corporate transaction or
other event. If any redemption is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived
by the Issuer in the Issuer’s discretion), and/or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the
Issuer in the Issuer’s discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed, and/or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time by the Issuer if the Issuer determines in its discretion that
any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

Unless otherwise required by law, the Issuer will not deduct or withhold from payments made by
the Issuer under or with respect to the guarantees on account of any present or future taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on
behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction (“Taxes”). In the event that the Issuer is required to withhold or deduct
any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes,
the Issuer will pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) so that the net amount received by
each holder of Notes (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the
amount that such holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or
deducted.

Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to a payment made to a holder of Notes or a
holder of beneficial interests in global securities where such holder is subject to taxation on such payment
by a relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such holder’s mere ownership of the securities
or for or on account of:

    - any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited
liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a Person holding a power over an
estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:

    - is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or
business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Taxing
Jurisdiction;

    - has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of such
securities) with the Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such taxes, including being or having been a
citizen or resident thereof or being treated as being or having been a resident thereof;

    - with respect to any withholding taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with respect to
the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company, a
controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or corporation that has
accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or owns or owned 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Issuer;

    - any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed with
respect to the securities, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture;

72


-----

    - any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Notes, where presentation
is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment
became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been
entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had such Notes been presented for payment
on any date during such 30-day period;

    - any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other Person to
comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting
requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing
Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the
relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes;

    - with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by
reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of sections 871(h) or
881(c) of the Code;

    - any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Issuer
or any paying agent from payments in respect of such securities;

    - any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any
securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying
agent; and

    - any combination of the above conditions.

Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any holder of securities or holder
of a beneficial interest in such securities if such payment would not be subject to such withholding or
deduction of Taxes but for the failure of such holder or holder of a beneficial interest in such securities to
make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption or to provide a certificate
declaring its non-residence, if the Issuer were treated as a domestic corporation under United States
federal income tax and if (x) the making of such declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is
required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing
authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 90
days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Issuer shall apply this paragraph, the Issuer
shall have notified all holders of securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration
or claim.

Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any holder of securities or the holder of a
beneficial interest in a global security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other
fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole holder of such security or holder of such
beneficial interests of such security, as the case may be. The exception, however, will apply only to the
extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the
partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to
the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received
directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.

In addition, no Additional Amounts will be paid on account of any taxes imposed or withheld
pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official
interpretations thereof.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes of a
series is due and payable, if the Issuer will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional

73


-----

Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other information as is necessary to enable
the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of such Notes on the payment date.

The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination or the discharge of an Indenture and shall
apply to any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any successor to the Issuer is organized or is engaged in
business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
principal, premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to
the Notes, such mention includes the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent payable in the
particular context.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuer has
exercised its option to redeem the Notes, the Issuer shall be required to make an offer (a “Change of
Control Offer”) to each holder of the Notes to repurchase, at the holder’s election, all or any part (equal to

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of the Notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below
and collectively referred to as “Holders”) of the Notes. The discussion below is based upon the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury regulations, rulings,
administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to
change or differing interpretations at any time with possible retroactive effect. We have not requested,
and do not intend to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result no assurance can be given
that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any
challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all of the possible tax consequences of the
acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes and does not address all tax consequences that might
be relevant to particular Holders in light of their personal circumstances. In particular, this summary deals
only with Holders that acquire the Notes pursuant to this offering at the issue price set forth on the cover
of this information memorandum and will hold the Notes as “capital assets” (generally, property held for
investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not include any
description of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. government that may be applicable to a
particular Holder and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation.
This summary does not address U.S. federal alternative minimum tax consequences. In addition, this
summary does not apply to Holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as dealers, brokers or
traders in securities or currencies, financial institutions, mutual funds or “financial services entities,”
banks, thrifts, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, taxexempt entities, entities or arrangements treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as partnerships, S
corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid
U.S. federal income tax, retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts, persons that hold Notes as a
part of a hedge, straddle, conversion transaction, constructive sale or other arrangement involving more
than one position, U.S. expatriates, persons that are required to report income no later than when such
income is reported in an “applicable financial statement” and investors who receive Notes as
compensation. This summary also does not address tax consequences to Holders as a result of using a
“functional currency” that is not the U.S. dollar.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is: (a) an
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (b) a
corporation (or other business entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
(c) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d)
a trust (i) if a court within the United States can exercise primary supervision over its administration, and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) that has a
valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder or
an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in or other owner of the entity will generally depend upon the status of the partner
or other owner and the activities of the entity. A partner in or other owner of such an entity is urged to
consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

**The discussion set out below is intended only as a summary of certain U.S. federal income**
**tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Holders are urged**
**to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and**
**disposition of the Notes, including the application to their particular situation of the tax**
**consequences discussed below, as well as the application of other federal tax laws and state,**

84


-----

**local or non-U.S. tax laws. The discussion set out below is based on the laws and regulations in**
**force and interpretations thereof as of the date hereof, which are subject to changes occurring**
**after the date hereof.**

**Notes Subject to Contingencies**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of
Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), we may be obligated to pay Holders additional amounts in
excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes. It is possible that our obligation to make additional
payments on the Notes could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent
payment debt instruments.” If the Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt instruments,
Holders might, among other things, be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated
interest rate on the Notes and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note as
ordinary income rather than as capital gain.

We intend to take the position that the likelihood of additional payments on the Notes is remote,
and thus, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our
determination that these contingencies are remote is binding on a Holder unless it discloses its contrary
position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination, however, is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to challenge our determination, a Holder might be required to include
in gross income an amount of ordinary interest income on the Notes in excess of the stated interest on
the Notes, and to treat income realized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather
than capital gain. In the event a contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of income
recognized by a Holder. If any contingent amounts are in fact paid, a Holder will be required to recognize
such amounts as income.

The remainder of this disclosure assumes that our determination that the contingencies are
remote is correct. The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not
been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the Treasury regulations is not
certain. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.

**Tax Consequences for U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Each payment of stated interest on a Note (including any amount withheld as backup withholding
tax) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is
received, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

_General_

A debt instrument with a term to maturity that exceeds one year will be treated as issued with
original issue discount (“OID”) if the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the debt instrument exceeds
its “issue price” by more than the de minimis amount (such amount, “de minimis OID”) of less than 1⁄4 of 1
percent of the “stated redemption price at maturity” multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity
from the issue date. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Notes may exceed the “issue price”
of the Notes by more than a de minimis amount. In that case, the Notes will be treated as issued with
OID. Following is a summary of the OID rules and their application to the Notes.

If a substantial amount of Notes in an issue is issued for money, the “issue price” of a Note in the
issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money (ignoring sales to bond

-----

houses, brokers or similar persons acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). A U.S. Holder may obtain the issue price of a Note by contacting us at the address set forth
under “Summary—Overview.” The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note generally is the sum of
all payments provided by the Note other than “qualified stated interest” payments. Generally, an interest
payment on a Note is “qualified stated interest” if it is one of a series of stated interest payments on a
Note that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate, with certain exceptions for
lower rates paid during some periods, applied to the outstanding principal amount of the Note. Interest is
considered unconditionally payable only if reasonable legal remedies exist to compel timely payment or
the Note otherwise provides terms and conditions that make the likelihood of late payment (other than a
late payment that occurs within a reasonable grace period) or non-payment a remote contingency.
Interest is payable at a single fixed rate only if the rate appropriately takes into account the length of the
interval between payments. Thus, if the interval between payments varies during the term of a Note, the
value of the fixed rate on which a payment is based generally must be adjusted to reflect a compounding
assumption consistent with the length of the interval preceding the payment.

Notes that have _de minimis OID generally will be treated as not having OID unless a U.S. Holder_
elects to treat all interest on the Note as OID. See “—Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue
Discount (Constant Yield Method).”

Because the Notes may be issued with OID, a U.S. Holder may be required to include OID in
gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues (regardless of its method of accounting),
which may be in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to that income. OID accrues under the
constant yield method, based on a compounded yield to maturity, as described below. Accordingly, a U.S.
Holder generally would be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in
successive accrual periods.

The annual amounts of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder will be equal to the sum of the
“daily portions” of the OID with respect to a Note for each day on which such U.S. Holder owns the Note
during the taxable year. Generally, a U.S. Holder determines the daily portions of OID by allocating to
each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that is allocable to that accrual period. The
term “accrual period” means an interval of time with respect to which the accrual of OID is measured. The
accrual period may vary in length over the term of a Note provided that each accrual period is no longer
than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on either the first or last day of
an accrual period.

The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will be the excess of (i) the product of (x) the
“adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and (y) the “yield to maturity” of
the Note over (ii) the aggregate amount of any qualified stated interest payments on the Note that are
allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual
period is the issue price of the Note, and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the
amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any holder, reduced by the amount of any
payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) previously made on the Note. If an interval
between payments of qualified stated interest on a Note contains more than one accrual period, then,
when a U.S. Holder determines the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period, such U.S. Holder must
allocate the amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval, including any qualified
stated interest that is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately following the interval, pro
rata to each accrual period in the interval. In addition, a U.S. Holder must increase the adjusted issue
price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval by the amount of any qualified stated interest
that has accrued prior to the first day of the accrual period but that is not payable until the end of the
interval. If all accrual periods are of equal length except for either an initial shorter accrual period or an
initial and a final shorter accrual period, a U.S. Holder may compute the amount of OID allocable to the
initial accrual period using any reasonable method; however, the OID allocable to the final accrual period
will always be the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified
stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period.

86

_Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method)_

A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on its Note using the
constant yield method described above under “—General,” with the modifications described below. For
purposes of this election, interest will include qualified stated interest, OID, _de minimis OID and unstated_
interest. If a U.S. Holder makes this election for its Note, then, when such U.S. Holder applies the
constant yield method: the issue price of the Note will be equal to its cost; the issue date of the Note will
be the date such U.S. Holder acquired the Note; and no payments on the Note will be treated as
payments of qualified stated interest. Generally, this election will apply only to the Note for which a U.S.
Holder makes the election. A U.S. Holder may not revoke an election to apply the constant yield method
to all interest on a Note without the consent of the IRS.

**_Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the cash and the fair
market value of any property received (other than any amounts allocated to accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously so taxed) and such
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be
equal to the cost of the Note, increased by the amount of any OID on the Note previously included in
income and decreased (but not below zero) by any payment previously received with respect to the Note
other than payments of qualified stated interest. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be a
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Notes exceeds one year at the
time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note. If the holding period for the
Note is one year or less at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Note, any capital gain or loss generally will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital
gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Additional Tax on Passive Income_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, or that are estates or trusts and whose income exceeds
certain thresholds are required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, interest income and
capital gains from the sale or other disposition of notes, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. U.S.
Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax on their ownership
and disposition of the Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of principal of, and
interest and accruals of OID on, a Note, and any proceeds of the disposition of a Note before maturity, to
a U.S. Holder other than certain exempt recipients, such as corporations. A U.S. Holder may also be
subject to backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24%) with respect to payments of interest and the
gross proceeds received pursuant to a disposition unless the U.S. Holder is (i) a corporation or other
exempt recipient and, when required, establishes this exemption or (ii) provides its correct taxpayer
identification number, certifies that it is not currently subject to backup withholding tax and otherwise
complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules. A U.S. Holder that does not
provide its correct taxpayer identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any; provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely
manner. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of backup
withholding to their particular situation, the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**Tax Consequences for Non-U.S. Holders**

_Payments of Interest_

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding (“—Information Reporting and
Backup Withholding”) and any application of FATCA (as defined below, “—FATCA”), payments of interest
on a Note (including OID) to a Non-U.S. Holder that are not effectively connected with such Non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States generally will not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax or U.S. withholding tax, if:

    - such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Issuer’s voting
stock;

    - such Non-U.S. Holder is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a controlled foreign
corporation related, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer through stock ownership under
applicable rules of the Code;

    - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - the certification requirement, as described below, is fulfilled with respect to the beneficial
owner of the Note.

The certification requirement referred to above will be fulfilled if either (A) a Non-U.S. Holder
provides to us or our paying agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form),
signed under penalties of perjury, that includes its name and address and a certification as to its non-U.S.
status, or (B) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’
securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business holds the Note on behalf of the beneficial owner
and provides a statement to us or our paying agent, signed under penalties of perjury, in which the
organization, bank or financial institution certifies that it has received an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (or successor form) from the non-U.S. beneficial owner or from another financial institution
acting on behalf of such beneficial owner and furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof and
otherwise complies with the applicable IRS requirements. Other methods might be available to satisfy the
certification requirements described above, depending on the Non-U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances.

The gross amount of payments of interest that do not qualify for the exemption from withholding
described above (the “portfolio interest exemption”) will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%
unless (A) a Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E
(or successor form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under an applicable tax treaty,
or (B) such interest is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
within the United States and such Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI (or
successor form).

**_Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_**

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and if interest on the
Note or gain realized on the disposition of the Note is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade
or business, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the
interest or gain on a net basis in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless
an applicable treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, such
Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to a branch profits tax on its earnings and profits for the taxable
year, subject to certain adjustments, at a rate of 30% unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax
treaty. Even though such effectively connected income is subject to income tax, and may be subject to

88


-----

the branch profits tax, it is not subject to withholding tax if such Non-U.S. Holder satisfies the certification
requirements described above.

**_Sale, Exchange or Disposition of the Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and any application of FATCA (as
defined below), a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain
realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of such Note (other than gain that represents
accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, in which case the rules regarding interest
would apply) unless:

    - such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or

    - such gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
within the United States.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Unless certain exceptions apply, we must report annually to the IRS and to any Non-U.S. Holder
any interest paid to such Non-U.S. Holder during the taxable year. Copies of these information returns
may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or other agreement to the tax
authorities of the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides.

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, backup withholding tax will not apply to payments of
interest by us or our paying agent on a Note if the certifications described above under “—Payments of
Interest” are received, provided that we or our paying agent, as the case may be, do not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that the payee is a U.S. person.

The gross proceeds from a sale, exchange or other disposition of a Note by a Non-U.S. Holder
made to or through a foreign office of a foreign broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding
or information reporting. However, if such broker is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: a U.S. person; a
controlled foreign corporation; a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business for a specified three- year period; or a foreign partnership with
certain connections to the United States, then information reporting will be required unless the broker has
in its records documentary evidence that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. person and certain other
conditions are met or the beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding at the
applicable rate, currently 24%, may apply to any payment that such broker is required to report if the
broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the payee is a U.S. person. Payments to or through
the U.S. office of a broker will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the
beneficial owner certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person, or otherwise establishes
an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund or a
credit against such Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability of any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S.
Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting
and backup withholding rules in their particular situations, the availability of an exemption therefrom, and
the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**_FATCA_**

Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial institutions
(which include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and
any other investment vehicles) and certain other foreign entities must comply with information reporting
rules with respect to their U.S. account holders and investors or confront a withholding tax on U.S. source
payments made to them (whether received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party).

89


-----

More specifically, a foreign financial institution or other foreign entity that does not comply with the
FATCA reporting requirements will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any
“withholdable payments.” For this purpose, withholdable payments include U.S.-source payments
otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax and, subject to the discussion of the proposed Treasury
regulations below, the entire gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of certain equity or debt
instruments of U.S. issuers. This withholding tax will apply to a non-compliant foreign financial institution
regardless of whether the payment would otherwise be exempt from U.S. nonresident withholding tax
(e.g., under the portfolio interest exemption or as gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder on the taxable
disposition of a Note). This withholding tax will not apply to withholdable payments made directly to
foreign governments, international organizations, foreign central banks of issue and individuals, and the
IRS is authorized to provide additional exceptions.

Withholding under FATCA will generally apply to payments of interest on a Note made to foreign
financial institutions that are not in compliance with FATCA. The U.S. Department of the has issued
proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the U.S. federal withholding
tax of 30% applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or disposition of debt instruments. In its preamble to
the proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed
regulations until final regulations are issued.

If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding
tax discussed above, the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such
other withholding tax. Foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have entered into intergovernmental
agreements with the United States in connection with FATCA may be subject to different rules.

**Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the effect of U.S.**
**federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax laws, as well as treaties, with regard to an investment**
**in the Notes, including any reporting requirements.**

certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Notice to Investors.”
In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and
Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

Initially, the trustee will act as paying agent and registrar. The Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar.

**Certain Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the
control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to change by them from time to time. We
take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or
their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book- entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other
entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).

Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC
only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of
ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the
Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, (i) upon deposit of the
Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with
portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes and (ii) ownership of such interests in the Global
Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
(with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if they are
Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream)
which are Participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests
held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such
systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of
securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such
persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn
act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of a person having beneficial interests
in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system,
or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate
evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered
in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered
in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under
the indenture governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, we and the
trustee will treat the persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the
owners thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes
whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the trustee nor any of our or the trustee’s agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the
Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or
Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or (ii) any
other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants.
DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities, such
as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with
the payment on the payment date, in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal
amount of beneficial interest in the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC unless DTC has
reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Payments by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will
not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or us. Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay

92


-----

by DTC or any of its Participants or indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes,
and we and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC
or its nominee for all purposes.

Except for trades involving Euroclear and Clearstream participants, interests in the Global Notes
are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and secondary market
trading activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately available funds, subject in all cases to
the rules and procedures of DTC and its Participants. See “—Same-Day Settlement and Payment.”
Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and
transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein,
crossmarket transfers between the Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market
transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the
counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established
deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take
action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note
in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver
instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at
the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global
Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such
Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under
the indenture governing the Notes,

DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and
to distribute such Notes to its Participants.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform the
foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and in the Rule
144A Global Notes among Participants in DTC, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.
Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of
their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive Notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated
Notes”) if (i) DTC (x) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes
and we thereupon fail to appoint a successor depositary or (y) has ceased to be a clearing agency
registered under the Exchange Act, or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a default or event
of default with respect to the Notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged
for Certificated Notes upon request but only upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf
of DTC in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes, and in accordance with the certification
requirements set forth in the indenture governing the Notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in
exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests therein will be registered in the names, and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC (in accordance with its customary
procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors,” unless we
determine otherwise in compliance with applicable law.

93

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such exchange
occurs in connection with a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to
the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture governing the Notes) to the effect
that the Notes are being transferred to a person who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified
institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A, purchasing for its own account or the account of a
qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance
with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. Beneficial
interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture
governing the Notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of
Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available).

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for a
beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa will be effected in DTC by means of an
instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly,
in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of
the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes
that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will,
upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable
to beneficial interest in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the
expiration of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the applicable
indenture certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is
either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt
from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, must provide to the trustee (or the paying agent if other than the trustee) a certificate in the form
required by the applicable indenture, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial
interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same-Day Settlement and Payment**

Payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified
by the Global Note holder. With respect to any Notes in certificated form, we will make all payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the holders thereof or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such
holder’s registered address. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to
trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity
in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any
such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities
settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately
following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream

94


-----

as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a
Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
following DTC’s settlement date.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The issuance and sale of the Notes and the guarantees have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and, unless so registered, the Notes may not be
offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to or for the account of any
U.S. person, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. The Notes are being offered
and issued, only (a) in the United States to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional
buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A), or QIBs, in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and (b) outside the U.S. to persons other than U.S.
persons in reliance upon Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to represent, warrant, and agree as follows (terms
used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used
herein as defined therein):

(1) It (A) (i) is a QIB and (ii) is acquiring the Notes for its own account or for the account of
a QIB or (B) is not a U.S. person and is acquiring the Notes in an offshore transaction
pursuant to Regulation S.

(2) It understands that the Notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public
offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes
have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the
future it decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes, such
Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) in the United
States to a person whom the seller reasonably believes is a QIB in compliance with
Rule 144A, (ii) outside the United States in a transaction complying with the provisions
of Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act, including the exemption provided by Rule 144 (if available and
provided that prior to such transfer, the trustee is furnished with an opinion of counsel
acceptable to the Issuer that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act), (iv)
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (v) to us or
any of our subsidiaries, in each of cases (i) through (v) in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any State of the United States, and that (B) it will, and each
subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it
of the resale restrictions referred to in clause (A) above.

(3) It understands that the Notes will, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the holder
thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT
BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHIN THE

RESELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY EXCEPT (A) TO THE
ISSUER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) TO A PERSON WHOM THE
HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QIB IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE
144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN
AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM

the Notes and can afford the complete loss of such investment.

(6) It acknowledges that (a) none of us, the initial purchasers or any person acting
on behalf of any of the foregoing has made any statement, representation, or
warranty, express or implied, to it with respect to the Issuer or the offer or sale
of any Notes, other than the information we have included in this offering
memorandum, and (b) any information it desires concerning the Issuer, the
Notes or any other matter relevant to its decision to acquire the Notes (including
a copy of the offering memorandum) is or has been made available to it.

97


-----

whose underlying assets include the assets of such employee benefit plans, (ii)
a plan, an account or an arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code, or
an entity whose underlying assets are considered to include the assets of such
plan, account or arrangement or (iii) a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other
plan which is subject to provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or
the Code (“Similar Law”) or (B) its acquisition, holding, disposition or transfer of
a Note will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a
governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Law), and none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers nor any of
their respective affiliates is its fiduciary in connection with the acquisition and
holding of a Note.

(8) It acknowledges that the trustee will not be required to accept for registration of
transfer any Notes acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to the Issuer and the trustee that the restrictions set forth herein
have been complied with.

(9) It acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and
agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations or
agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no
longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and the initial purchasers. If it is
acquiring the Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it
represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such
account and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments,
representations, and agreements on behalf of each account.

98

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) among the Issuer, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representative of
the several initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers
have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not jointly, all of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions
by counsel.

The initial purchasers have agreed to resell the Notes (a) in the United States to persons who
they reasonably believe are QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S, in each case, under the Securities Act.
See “Notice to Investors.” The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page
hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may
from time to time be varied by the initial purchasers. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject an
order of Notes in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial
purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, issue,
contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any dollar-denominated debt securities issued or
guaranteed by us and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of such debt securities, or publicly disclose the
intention to make any such offer, sale, issuance, pledge or disposition without the prior written consent of
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. on behalf of the initial purchasers, for a period of 60 days after the date of
this offering memorandum.

The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
the Notes may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no
active market for the Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will
sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading
market for the Notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply
for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a
market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at
any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, market-making activities will be subject
to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, no assurance can be given
as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2021
which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes, or “T+ .” Under Rule
15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required,
by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the
date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part
of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering. The initial

99


-----

purchasers will send to any dealer to whom they sell Notes during such period a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, United States persons.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.
