#### $1,300,000,000

# Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC Prime Finance Inc.
#### $1,300,000,000 % Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028


Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Issuer”) and Prime Finance Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with the Issuer, the “Issuers,”), each a wholly owned subsidiary
of ADT Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” and, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “ADT,” “we,”
“our,” and “us”), are offering $1,300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Second-Priority Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”).
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum and will mature on, 2028. Interest on the Notes will
be payable semi-annually on and of each year, commencing on, 2020.
The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit
Facility, will be used to (a) redeem the outstanding $1,246 million aggregate principal amount of Prime Notes (as
defined herein) in full and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein).
The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Issuer’s wholly owned domestic restricted
subsidiaries that guarantees our First Lien Credit Agreement (as defined herein). Subject to certain exceptions, to the
extent lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement release the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor, such subsidiary
guarantor will also be released from its obligations under the Notes. The Notes and related guarantees will be secured by
second-priority security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of our existing and future assets, which
assets also secure our First Lien Credit Agreement and certain other debt, as further described in this offering
memorandum. The Notes and guarantees will (i) rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing and
future senior indebtedness, (ii) rank senior to all of the Issuers’ future subordinated indebtedness, (iii) be effectively senior
to all of the Issuers’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the
Notes, (iv) be equal to all of the Issuers’ existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a secondpriority basis, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, (v) be effectively junior to all of the
Issuers’ existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a senior-priority basis, including indebtedness
under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes (as defined herein), the First-Priority Notes (as defined herein) and
certain other debt, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and (vi) be structurally
subordinated to all obligations of each of the Issuers’ subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the Notes.
We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth in
this offering memorandum. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
prior to, 2023, with an amount equal to the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption
price set forth in this offering memorandum. Prior to, 2023, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the applicable
“make-whole” premium set forth in this offering memorandum. We may be required to redeem the Notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if we experience a change of
control. There is no sinking fund for the Notes. See “Description of Notes.”
We are not obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the Notes for resale or to
exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange
or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated quotation system.
_Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15._

**Price of the Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from** **, 2020.**
We expect that delivery of the Notes to purchasers will be made in New York on or about, 2020 through the
book- entry delivery system of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the federal securities laws or the securities laws of any
state. The initial purchaser named below is offering the Notes (a) in the United States to persons who they
reasonably believe are qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act
(“Rule 144A”) and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). See “Notice to Investors” for additional information about
eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

We include statements regarding market share and ranking and factors that have impacted our industry.
Such statements are statements of belief and are based on industry data and forecasts that we have obtained from
industry publications and surveys, as well as from internal company sources and our management’s knowledge
and experience in the markets in which we operate. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state
that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no
assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Neither we nor the initial purchaser have
independently verified any of the data from third-party sources, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic
assumptions relied upon therein. In addition, while we believe that the industry information included herein is
generally reliable as of the dates thereof, such information is inherently imprecise. While we are not aware of any
misstatements regarding the industry data presented herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are
subject to change based on various factors, in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the 2018 Annual Report and
the other information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. These factors could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these publications. Accordingly, investors should not
place undue weight on the industry, ranking and market data presented in this offering memorandum.

iv


-----

**NO SEC REVIEW**

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has**
**approved or disapproved of the Notes or determined if this offering memorandum is truthful or complete.**
**Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information that would be
required if this offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. This offering
memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed by the SEC.
There are no registration rights associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer notes in a transaction
registered under the Securities Act in exchange for the Notes or to file a registration statement with respect to the
Notes. The indenture governing the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “TIA”).

v


-----

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

To provide to holders of the Notes additional information in connection with our results as determined by
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we disclose Adjusted
EBITDA, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC), Free Cash Flow, and Free Cash Flow before special items as
non-GAAP measures. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and
should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure
calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to
investors about our operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items that we do not
expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to our operations.
Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use
it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against
that of other peer companies using similar measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and
amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer
and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber
acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (vii) losses
on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency
gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments, and (xii) other charges and non-cash items.

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account
certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which
directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of
the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC)**

We believe that the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) is appropriate to provide
additional information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted to exclude the effect of our
subscriber acquisition costs. Additionally, we present Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC), which is used in
the indentures governing our First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, and will
be used in the indenture governing the Notes, as a supplemental measure of our performance and ability to
service debt and incur additional debt.

We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our statement
of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment
(expensed net SAC).

There are material limitations to using Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Covenant Adjusted
EBITDA (Pre-SAC) does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization,
interest, taxes, and other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs, which directly affect our net income
or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items
independently, and by considering Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in conjunction with net income as
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**Free Cash Flow**

We believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to
investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

vi


-----

We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital
expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber
system asset additions; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside
of our authorized dealer network. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because
they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.

Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and
therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.
Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt
repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best
addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**Free Cash Flow before special items**

We define Free Cash Flow before special items as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to
(i) financing and consent fees, (ii) restructuring and integration, (iii) integration related capital expenditures,
(iv) radio conversion costs, and (v) other payments or receipts that may mask the operating results or business
trends of the Company. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow before special
items is a useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.

Free Cash Flow before special items adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s
discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most
comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow before special items is not intended to represent residual cash flow
for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are
not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow before special items in combination
with the GAAP cash flow numbers.

    - our ability to launch new product and service offerings that achieve market acceptance with acceptable
margins;

    - changes in law, economic and financial conditions, including tax law changes, changes to privacy
requirements, changes to telemarketing, email marketing and similar consumer protection laws, interest

    - the other factors that are described in this offering memorandum under the heading “Risk Factors.”

These forward-looking statements reflect our views with respect to future events as of the date of this
offering memorandum or the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, and are based on
assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and
should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included or incorporated by reference
in this offering memorandum and in other filings. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date of this offering memorandum and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
update or review publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,
or otherwise after the date of this offering memorandum. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments
will cause our views to change. You should read this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by
reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different
from what we expect. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future
acquisitions, merger, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may undertake. We qualify all of our
forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

outstanding 9.250% Second-Priority Notes due 2023 of the Issuers (the “Prime Notes”) in accordance with the
indenture governing the Prime Notes. We intend to redeem all outstanding Prime Notes and simultaneously to
discharge our obligations with respect to such Prime Notes and the indenture governing such Prime Notes in
accordance with the terms of that indenture (the “Prime Notes Redemption”). If the offering of the Notes is not
successfully consummated, the Issuers will not redeem any Prime Notes.

Throughout this offering memorandum, we collectively refer to this offering and the Prime Notes
Redemption as the “Transactions.” See “—Sources and Uses of Funds” for additional detail regarding the
Transactions.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility, will be used to (a) redeem the outstanding $1,246 million aggregate principal amount
of Prime Notes in full and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

**Recent Developments**

**_Preliminary Fiscal 2019 Results_**

Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 are not yet available.
Based on our preliminary results, we anticipate that total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 to


1


-----

be between $5.00 billion and $5.15 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 is
anticipated to be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion, and Free Cash Flow before special items for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019 is anticipated to be between $570 million and $610 million. In addition, gross
customer revenue attrition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 is anticipated to be approximately 13.5%.
These preliminary results are consistent with our previously issued full-year 2019 guidance. Our financial closing
procedures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 are not yet complete. As a result, our actual
results for the year ended December 31, 2019 may differ materially from the preliminary estimated financial
results included in our financial outlook ranges for full-year 2019 upon the completion of our financial closing
procedures, final adjustments, and other developments that may arise prior to the time our financial results are
finalized. All of the range data presented above is preliminary and unaudited, based upon our estimates, and
subject to further internal review by our management and compilation of actual results. We have provided
estimated ranges for this data primarily because our closing procedures for the quarter ended December 31, 2019
are not yet complete and we have not generated data for the full quarter. Our management’s estimates are based
upon monthly information currently available to us and extrapolation from such information. While we expect
that our results will be within these ranges, our actual results may differ materially from these preliminary
estimates. The preliminary estimated financial data included in this offering memorandum has been prepared by,
and is the responsibility of our management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, compiled,
nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to this preliminary estimated financial data, and accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of its financial outlook for Adjusted EBITDA
and Free Cash Flow before special items to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, which
are their respective corresponding GAAP measures, because these GAAP measures that are excluded from the
Company’s non-GAAP financial outlook are difficult to reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort
due to their dependence on future uncertainties, such as special items discussed herein under the heading “Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Information—Adjusted EBITDA” and “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information—Free
Cash Flow.” Additionally, information that is currently not available to the Company could have a potentially
unpredictable and potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results. The preliminary financial
and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 are forward-looking statements based on
preliminary estimates and reflect the best judgment of our management but involve a number of risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in our estimates and from
past results, performance or achievements. Such preliminary results are subject to finalization of our quarterly
and annual financial and accounting procedures and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consequently, there can be no assurances that the actual financial
and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 will be identical to the preliminary estimates
set forth above, and any variation between our actual results and the estimates set forth above may be material. In
addition, such results do not purport to indicate our results of operations for any future period beyond the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019.

Senior Secured Notes due 2028.

Maturity Date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ., 2028.

Notes Interest Rates and Payment
Dates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum

in excess thereof.

Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a secondpriority senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each of the
Issuer’s present and future direct or indirect wholly owned material
domestic subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit
Agreement. The guarantees will be automatically released upon
release of the corresponding guarantees of the First Lien Credit
Agreement (except a release by or as a result of payment under such
guarantee following a default by the direct obligor of the First Lien
Credit Agreement). However, any such released guarantees will be
reinstated if the released guarantors are required to subsequently
guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement. Additionally, no such
guarantee will be released if the related guarantor is guaranteeing or
acting as a co-obligor of any other material indebtedness of the Issuer
or its restricted subsidiaries.

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuers’ senior
secured obligations and will:

                       - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing
and future senior obligations;

                       - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ future debt and
other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;

                       - be effectively senior to all of the Issuers’ existing and future
unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing the Notes;


4


-----

                       - be equal to all of the Issuers’ future indebtedness that is secured by
the collateral on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value
of the collateral securing such indebtedness;

                      - be effectively junior to all of the Company’s existing and future
indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a senior-priority
basis, including the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes
and the First-Priority Notes and certain other debt, to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and

                       - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of the
Issuers’ subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the Notes.

As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, the Notes would have ranked effectively junior to
$8,897 million face value of indebtedness drawn under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes (with a
further $155 million available for borrowing under the Revolving
Credit Facility, without giving effect to the letters of credit), to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. As of
September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Notes would not be structurally subordinated to any
indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, excluding
intercompany obligations and capital leases. See “Description of
Notes—Ranking.”

As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries held less than 5% of our
consolidated assets and had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding
intercompany obligations and capital leases. During the twelve month
period ended September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries generated
approximately 5% of our total pro forma revenue and less than 5% of
our Adjusted EBITDA.

Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the related guarantees will be secured by secondpriority security interests in the collateral (which generally includes
substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and the
subsidiary guarantors) subject to permitted liens and certain
exclusions as described herein.

The collateral securing the Notes will exclude: (i) certain real
property, (ii) motor vehicles, and certain commercial tort claims, (iii)
those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests
in such assets would be prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation
or certain contractual obligations (including leases, licenses or other
agreements, government licenses or state or local license, franchises,
charters or authorizations (in each case, except to the extent such
prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable antiassignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code), (iv) assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could
reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences

-----

as determined in good faith by the Issuer, (v) “intent-to-use”
trademark applications until an Amendment to Allege Use or
Statement of Use has been filed, (vi) certain securitization assets and
(vii) certain other limited assets.

For more information on the security granted, see “Description of
Notes—Security.” The security interests in the assets securing the
Notes may be released under certain circumstances without your
consent or the consent of the trustee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes” and “Description of
Notes—Release of Collateral.”

Intercreditor Agreements . . . . . . . . . . . . The security granted in the collateral to secure the Notes on a secondpriority basis also secures, on a first-priority basis, indebtedness under
the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority
Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will permit us to
secure additional indebtedness with liens on the collateral under
certain circumstances.

The Notes will be subject to an intercreditor agreement (the “First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) that establishes the
subordination of the liens securing the Notes to the liens securing the
first-priority lien obligations and certain other matters relating to the
administration of security interests. See “Description of Notes—First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or
after, 2023 at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum. Prior to, 2023, we may also redeem
the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, and
a “make whole” premium.

Additionally, prior to, 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with an amount equal to
the net proceeds of specified equity offerings at the redemption price
set forth in this offering memorandum.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Change of Control Offer to
Repurchase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we experience a change of control, we will be required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of the repurchase. See “Description of Notes—
Change of Control.”

Asset Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we sell certain assets, under certain circumstance we may be
required to offer to purchase the Notes at the redemption price listed
under “Description of Notes—Asset Sales.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture governing the Notes will, among other things, limit our
ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                      - pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital
stock and make other restricted payments;

                    - make investments;

                      - consummate certain asset sales;

                       - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                       - agree to any restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries
to make payments to us;

                       - grant or assume liens on certain assets; and

                       - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

In addition, certain of the covenants will be suspended if both
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services assign the Notes an investment grade rating in the future and
certain other conditions are met. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.” In the event that we and our restricted subsidiaries are
not subject to such covenants for any period of time as a result of the
preceding sentence and, on any subsequent date, one or more of such
rating agencies withdraws or downgrades the ratings assigned to the
Notes or a default or event of default occurs and is continuing under
the indenture relating to the Notes, then we and our restricted
subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to such covenants.

Transfer Restrictions; No Registration
Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The offer and sale of the Notes has not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Notes are
subject to certain restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or
sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See
“Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any
registration rights, and we will not be required to complete a
registered exchange offer or file a shelf registration statement for
resales of the Notes. We do not intend to issue registered notes in
exchange for the Notes and the absence of registration rights may
adversely impact the transferability of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There are


7


-----

restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes without
registration or the filing of a prospectus under applicable securities
laws, and the Notes are not subject to any future registration rights or
obligations.”

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on
hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be
used to (a) redeem the outstanding $1,246 million aggregate principal
amount of Prime Notes in full and (b) pay related fees and expenses
in connection with the Transactions. See “—The Transactions” and
“Use of Proceeds.”

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
public trading market. Although the initial purchaser has informed us
that it intends to make a market in the Notes, it is not obligated to do
so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained. We do not intend to list or apply
to list the Notes on any securities exchange or for quotation through
any automated quotation system. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Your ability to transfer the Notes
may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there
is no assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if
developed be maintained, for the Notes.”

Book-Entry Form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be issued in registered book-entry form represented by
one or more global notes to be deposited with or on behalf of DTC or
its nominee. Transfers of the Notes will only be effected through
facilities of DTC. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be
exchanged for certificated notes except in limited circumstances. See
“Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Additional Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . From time to time, without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of
the Notes, the Issuers may issue other debt securities under the
indenture governing the Notes in addition to the Notes, increase the
principal amount of the Notes that may be issued under the indenture
governing the Notes, and issue additional Notes in the future. Any
additional Notes issued in this manner will have the same terms as the
Notes being offered by this offering memorandum but may be offered
at a different offering price or have a different issue date, interest
accrual date or initial interest payment date than the Notes being
offered by this offering memorandum. If issued in this manner, these
additional Notes will become part of the same series as the Notes
being offered by this offering memorandum, including for purposes
of voting, redemptions and offers to purchase. If any additional Notes
issued in this manner are issued at a price that causes such additional
Notes to have more than a de minimis amount of “original issue
discount” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations of the
United States Department of Treasury thereunder (the “Code”), such


8


-----

additional Notes may not have the same CUSIP number as the Notes
offered by this offering memorandum. Holders of additional notes
issued in this manner will vote with holders of the Notes (except to
the extent the amendment affects a provision that is included in only
one series of notes).

Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

Notes Collateral Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The governing law for the Notes and the indenture governing the

“Risk Factors” and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the 2018
Annual Report and the other information included or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum in deciding whether to

**Summary Historical And Other Data**

The following summary historical consolidated financial and other data of ADT Inc. should be read together
with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the
historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the 2018 Annual Report and the Q3
Quarterly Report, each of which are incorporated by reference herein.

We derived the summary historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc.
for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 from ADT Inc.’s unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements included in its Q3 Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference herein.

We derived the summary historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc.
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 from ADT Inc.’s consolidated financial statements
included in its 2018 Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference herein.

We derived the summary historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc.
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 by taking the summary historical consolidated statements of
operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2018, plus the summary historical
consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc. for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, less the summary historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data of ADT Inc. for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018.

(3) Gross customer revenue attrition is defined as RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and
reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) customers. Customer
sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations
charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, generally twelve to
fifteen months.

Gross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the annualized
RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts
monitored but not owned and DIY customers, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an
average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.

As of January 1, 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of LifeShield LLC, we began presenting gross customer
revenue attrition excluding existing and new DIY customers. As a result, trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue
attrition excludes DIY customers for all periods presented in this offering memorandum. For all reports covering periods
prior to January 1, 2019, trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition included DIY customers. Including DIY
customers as of September 30, 2018 rounds to the same percentage as presented in this offering memorandum.

Gross customer revenue attrition for 2016 is presented on a pro forma basis for The ADT Corporation business.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) are non-GAAP measures that we believe is useful to
investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business and to provide additional information to
investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the
future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC)
provide a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance,
making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar
measures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization,
including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible
assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (vi) merger,
restructuring, integration, and other, (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs, (ix) financing
and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments, and (xii) other charges and
non-cash items. We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our
statement of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment
(expensed net SAC).

There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Adjusted
EBITDA do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and
other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs, which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations
are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted
EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with
GAAP.

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum,_
_including the matters addressed under “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” you should_
_carefully consider the following risks before investing in the Notes._

_You should also read the risk factors and other cautionary statements, including those described under the_
_sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the 2018 Annual Report filed by ADT Inc., which are incorporated by_
_reference in this offering memorandum._

_We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The_
_risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash_
_flows, and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and_
_uncertainties not currently known to us; or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that_
_we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,_
_cash flows, and results of operations._

**Risks Related to the Company and the Offering**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to_**
**_fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us_**
**_from meeting our obligations under the Notes._**

We are a highly leveraged company. As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, we would have had $10,197 million face value of outstanding indebtedness (excluding capital
leases). On a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, we will have total debt service payments of $537
million (including approximately $365 million of debt service relating to fixed rate obligations) for the first year
following the consummation of the Transactions.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes. For
example, it could:

    - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the
Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including
restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture
governing the Notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness;

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our
indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

    - make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive
disadvantage;

    - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new
technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

    - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things,
our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets;

15


-----

    - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence
of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute a default under the indenture
governing the Notes; or

    - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under the First Lien Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest.

In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, the ADT Notes and the
First-Priority Notes contain, or will contain, restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities
that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of
default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on_**
**_the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that are not waived by the required holders
and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could leave us unable to pay principal, premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes and could substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to
generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of
principal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various
covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including
the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes), we could be in default under the
terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such
indebtedness could elect to (i) declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, (ii) terminate their commitments and cease making further loans and (iii) institute
foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders
under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the holders of the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes to avoid
being in default. If we breach our covenants under the documents governing our indebtedness and seek a waiver,
we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders, as applicable. If this occurs, we
would be in default under the documents governing our indebtedness, the lenders or holders, as applicable, could
exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. See “Description
of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes”.

Upon any such bankruptcy filing, under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy
Code”), we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the Notes, and the holders of the Notes
would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs or charges to the extent the amount
of the obligations due under the Notes exceeded the value of the collateral (after taking into account all other
senior debt that was also secured by the collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured
portion of the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, which could_**
**_intensify the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of
the indenture governing the Notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain restrictions on our
and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance
with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations
that do not constitute indebtedness. As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, we would have had approximately $155 million available for additional borrowing under the

16

Revolving Credit Facility (without giving effect to letters of credit), all of which would be secured on a firstpriority basis. In addition to the Notes and our indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT
Notes and the First-Priority Notes, the covenants under any other existing or future debt instruments could allow
us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in
turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under “—Our substantial indebtedness
could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability
to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments on the
Notes.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and_**
**_to fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy_**
**_our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful._**

Our ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend
upon, among other things:

    - our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost savings described
herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and
financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control;

    - our future ability to refinance or restructure our existing debt obligations, which depends on, among
other things, the condition of the capital markets, our financial condition, and the terms of existing or
future debt agreements; and

    - our future ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which depends on,
among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit agreement governing such
facilities.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be
able to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs,
including the payment of principal and interest on the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to
reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to
meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the
condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the instruments
governing the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, may restrict us from
adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at
all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our
debt service obligations then due. Investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo Global
Management, Inc., its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, who collectively are our controlling shareholder, have no
continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to
satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could
negatively impact our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of the Notes,
the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes and lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement could declare all

17


-----

outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could
terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders (including the lenders under our First Lien
Credit Agreement and the holders of the Notes, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes) could foreclose
against the assets securing the indebtedness owing to them, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. All of these events could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the Notes.

If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to repay or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness,
including the Notes, before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to
enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

**_Changes in our credit rating could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on
their overall view of our industry. Additionally, we cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their
ratings on the Notes. A negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices
of the Notes and on our ability to secure future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

**_Repayment of our debt, including the Notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries._**

The Issuers are holding companies and have no direct operations other than holding the equity interests in
our subsidiaries and activities directly related thereto. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the
Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and, if they are not guarantors of the
Notes, their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are
guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make
funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make
distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our
subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit
our ability to obtain cash from them and we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to
distribute their earnings to us. While the First Lien Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the ADT
Notes and the First-Priority Notes limit, and the indenture governing the Notes will limit, the ability of our
subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not
receive distributions from our non-guarantor subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our current and future non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our current and future
subsidiaries that are not or will not be guaranteeing the Notes, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries,
including trade creditors, will have priority as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay
the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to us. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 5% of our total
revenue and less than 5% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries held less than 5% of our consolidated assets and had no
outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations and capital leases.

In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that
may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

18


-----

The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that are not
material or wholly owned. These non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes, or to make any funds
available therefore, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the
subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or
reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of Notes to realize proceeds from the
sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’
creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries.

**_The lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the discretion to release any guarantors_**
**_under the First Lien Credit Agreement in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors_**
**_to be released from their guarantees of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement remain outstanding, any guarantee of the
Notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the trustee under the indenture
that will govern the Notes, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the First Lien
Credit Agreement or any other indebtedness. See “Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees”. The lenders
under the First Lien Credit Agreement will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the First Lien
Credit Agreement in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is
no longer a guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether
secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains and the indenture governing the Notes will contain, and any other
existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among
other things:

    - incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness, or issue certain preferred equity interests;

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or
make other restricted payments;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - make loans or certain investments;

    - sell certain assets;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

    - alter the businesses we conduct;

    - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

    - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—First Lien Credit Agreement—Revolving Credit Facility.”

As a result of these covenants, we will continue to be limited in the manner in which we conduct our
business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital
needs.

19


-----

A failure to comply with the covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness or any of our other
future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any such default, the
lenders thereunder:

    - will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;

    - could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to
be immediately due and payable;

    - could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or

    - could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes; any of which could
result in an event of default under the Notes.

Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to
repay those amounts, the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral
granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral
under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement or our other indebtedness,
including the Notes, were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay
such indebtedness in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

**_Because each subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero, avoided or_**
**_released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the_**
**_subsidiary guarantors._**

The guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that such guarantors are
permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, any such guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could
be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the
circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer
statutes could avoid the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the
guarantor. See “—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and
guarantees and the related security interests, and require holders of Notes to return payments received.”

In addition, the subsidiary guarantors will be automatically released from their guarantees upon the
occurrence of certain events, including the following:

    - the designation of a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

    - the release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the guarantee
of the Notes by a subsidiary guarantor; or

    - the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all the assets, of a subsidiary guarantor.

If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor is released, no holder of the Notes will have a claim as a
creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred
equity interests, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of
any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all of the outstanding Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus, without duplication,

20


-----

accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. Additionally, under the First Lien Credit Agreement, a
change of control constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
and terminate their commitments to lend under the Revolving Credit Facility. The source of funds for any
repurchase of the Notes, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes and repayment of borrowings under the First
Lien Credit Agreement would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other
sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient
funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of Notes or that restrictions in our other
debt documents will not allow such repurchases. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund
any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our
ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as
leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a change of
control under the indenture governing the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

Courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which will be the governing law of
the indenture governing the Notes) have not provided clear and consistent meanings of such change of control
provisions, which leads to subjective judicial interpretation. In addition, a court case in Delaware has questioned
whether a change of control provision contained in an indenture could be unenforceable on public policy
grounds.

**_We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could affect our ability_**
**_to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the indenture
governing the Notes may allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancing or recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a change of control but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect
our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. The definition of change of control for purposes of the
Notes includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets taken as a whole.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require us to repurchase
Notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and guarantees_**
**_and the related security interests, and require holders of Notes to return payments received._**

If we or any guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code or encounters other financial
difficulty, under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer law a court may avoid or otherwise decline
to enforce the Notes or the guarantees and the related security interests. A court might do so if it found that when
we issued the Notes or the subsidiary guarantor entered into its guarantee and, in each case, granted the related
security interests, or in some states when payments became due under the Notes or the guarantees, we or the
subsidiary guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business;

    - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay; or

    - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed
against us or the subsidiary guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

The court might also avoid an issuance of Notes or a guarantee or the related security interest, without
regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the Notes or the applicable guarantor entered into its
guarantee and, in each case, provided the related security interest with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud our creditors.

21


-----

A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes or its guarantee or the related security interest if we or a guarantor did not
substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally
challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and
only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or any
guarantee or the related security interest, you would no longer have any claim against the Issuers or the
applicable guarantor, or the right to enforce or otherwise benefit from the applicable security interest. Sufficient
funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In
addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or a guarantor. In the
event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the
Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our
subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws will vary
depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent conveyance or transfer has
occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

    - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were
solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard, or, regardless of the
standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date;
that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences,
fraudulent conveyances or transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would
not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt.

Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that
guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations
under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter
to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or transfer law, or may reduce that
guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. See “—Because each
subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain
circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the subsidiary guarantors” above.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the Notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we
or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor
or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an “insider” within a
one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and such payment would give
the recipient more than it would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical
Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or
guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of “equitable
subordination” if the court determines that (a) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct,
(b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the
holders of Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service_**
**_obligations to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest
rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will
increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash
available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop collecting LIBOR rates from banks after 2021. The
announcement indicates that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. We are unable to predict the
effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any alternative reference rates, or any other
reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such
changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of
any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us.
As such, LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition.

We have entered into, and in the future we continue to enter into, interest rate swaps that involve the
exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not
maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any such swaps may not
fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous, or may create additional risks. As of
September 30, 2019, assuming our Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in interest rates
would result in a less than $1 million change in annual interest expense, including the impact of our interest rate
swaps, on indebtedness under our First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes without registration or the filing of a_**
**_prospectus under applicable securities laws, and the Notes are not subject to any future registration rights_**
**_or obligations._**

The Notes are being issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable
state and securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. We will not be
obligated to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or to register the reoffer and
resale of Notes under applicable securities laws. As a result, the transferability of the Notes may be negatively
affected. By receiving the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations
and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will not
be qualified under the TIA and the Issuers will not be required to comply with the provisions of the TIA.
Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the TIA or
similar provisions in the indenture governing the Notes.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is_**
**_no assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if developed be maintained, for the Notes._**

The Notes are each a new issue of securities for which there is no established public trading market. We do
not intend to have the Notes listed on a national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation
system. Affiliates of the initial purchaser has advised us that it intends to make a market in the Notes, if issued, as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations, but they are not obligated to make a market in any of the Notes,
and they may discontinue their market making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market
for any of the Notes may not develop or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any market for the
Notes will depend upon the number of holders of the Notes, our performance, the market for similar securities,
the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. A liquid trading market may
not develop for the Notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the
Notes may be materially and adversely affected. The market, if any, for any of the Notes may not be free from

23


-----

disruptions that may cause substantial volatility in the price of the Notes, and any such disruptions may
materially and adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, the Notes may trade at a
discount from their value on the date you acquired the Notes, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the
market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the Notes at maturity._**

At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, will become due and payable. We may not have the funds to fulfill these obligations or the ability to
renegotiate these obligations. If, upon the maturity date, other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the Notes,
we could try to obtain waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we
could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. In these circumstances, if we were not
able to obtain such waivers or refinance these borrowings, we would be unable to repay the Notes.

**_The market price for the Notes may be volatile and may require you to hold the Notes for an indefinite_**
**_period of time._**

The market for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, may become subject to disruptions that may
cause substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any market that may develop for the
Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may negatively impact the value of your
Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial
offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other
factors.

**_Many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the Notes will not apply during_**
**_any period in which the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and_**
**_Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and the holders of the Notes will lose the protection of these_**
**_covenants during any such periods._**

Many of the covenants contained in the indenture governing the Notes will not apply to us during any period
in which the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group, provided that at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such
covenants will include restrictions on, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions, incur
indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated
investment grade or that if the Notes ever are rated investment grade they will maintain these ratings. However,
suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while
these covenants were in force. For example, during any such suspension of these covenants, we would be able to
make dividends and distributions and incur substantial additional debt in amounts that would not otherwise be
permitted while these covenants were in force. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such
actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the indenture
governing the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until certificated notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes, owners of
the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. Instead, DTC, or its nominee, will be
the sole holder of the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the
Notes in global form will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to DTC. Thereafter, such
payments will be credited to DTC participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global
form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of
book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers

24


-----

or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if a holder owns a book-entry interest, such holder will be
permitted to act only to the extent such holder has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if
applicable, a participant. We cannot assure holders that the procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable holders to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

**_The Notes and guarantees will be subject to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement that_**
**_provides the Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the First Lien Credit Agreement,_**
**_the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and other creditors who have a first-priority security interest in_**
**_our assets to the extent of the value of such assets, and the liens securing the Notes will be released upon_**
**_the discharge of obligations that are secured by first-priority liens or release of first-priority liens._**

Substantially all the assets owned by the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors on the issue date of the Notes
or thereafter acquired, and all proceeds therefrom, will be subject to first-priority liens in favor of the lenders and
other secured parties under our First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes. The
collateral agent for the Notes (the “Notes Collateral Agent”) will become a party to the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement that provides that, at any time that any obligations that are secured by first-priority liens
remain outstanding, prior to the expiration of any applicable standstill period, any actions that may be taken in
respect of the collateral (including the ability to commence enforcement proceedings against the collateral and to
control the conduct of such proceedings) will be at the direction of the holders of such indebtedness. Under such
circumstances, the trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of Notes will not have the
ability to control or direct such actions, even if the rights of the holders of Notes are materially and adversely
affected. Further, in the event that the Issuers or a subsidiary guarantor is declared bankrupt, becomes insolvent
or is liquidated or reorganized, their obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the
First-Priority Notes will be entitled to be paid in full from their assets pledged as security for such obligation
before any payment from such assets or the proceeds thereof may be made with respect to the Notes. Holders of
the Notes would then participate ratably in the remaining assets pledged as collateral, with all holders of
indebtedness that are deemed to rank equally with the Notes based upon the respective amount owed to each
creditor. Also, under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes may be
required to turn over certain funds they may receive in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding to the lenders
under the First Lien Credit Agreement under certain circumstances.

In addition, if the Issuers and/or any guarantors default under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT
Notes or the First-Priority Notes, the lenders and other secured parties of such obligations could declare all of the
funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest, immediately due and payable and
foreclose on the pledged assets. However, if there were an event of default under the Notes, the holders of
obligations that are secured by first-priority liens could decide not to proceed against the collateral, regardless of
whether or not there is a default under such obligations that are secured by first-priority liens. In such event, the
only remedy available to the holders of the Notes would be to sue for payment on the Notes subject to the rights
of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the collateral after the expiration of the applicable
standstill periods under each Intercreditor Agreement following acceleration of the Notes in the event holders of
other obligations subject to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement are not exercising their rights
with respect to the Collateral.

Furthermore, if the lenders and other secured parties under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes
and the First-Priority Notes foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor, then that
subsidiary guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Notes automatically and immediately upon such
sale. Similarly, any release of all first-priority liens upon any collateral approved by the holders of first-priority
liens will also release the second-priority liens securing the Notes on substantially the same collateral, and
holders of Notes will have no control over such release. By virtue of the direction of the administration of the
pledges and security interests and the release of collateral, actions may be taken under the collateral documents
that may be adverse to holders of the Notes.

-----

Under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of
the Notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to
the use of the collateral to secure that financing that has been consented to by the lenders under the First Lien
Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. See “Description of Notes—First Lien/
Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially
deteriorate, and the Holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_The collateral may secure other indebtedness, the holders of which may control enforcement and other_**
**_actions relating to the collateral._**

The covenants with respect to the Notes allow us to incur significant amounts of additional secured
indebtedness, some of which may be secured by Liens that are pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the
Notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery
from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes._**

The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections as may be accepted by the trustee for the Notes and the Notes Collateral Agent any other
creditors that have the benefit of senior-priority liens on the collateral securing the Notes from time to time,
whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes
as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
availability of suitable buyers. No appraisals of any of the collateral have been prepared by us or on behalf of us
in connection with this offering. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have
no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the
date of this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value
of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic
conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future
events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes (and any additional future pari passu obligations) and
the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale
of the collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes,
the First-Priority Notes (and any additional future pari passu obligations) and the Notes will rank equally in right
of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade
payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the
collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior
secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is
filed and you will not be entitled to adequate protection of any such under-secured amount.

The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain
the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the
Notes Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of
any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Notes
Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may
significantly decrease.

In addition, the collateral securing the Notes will be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the
indenture governing the Notes, whether arising on or after the date the Notes are issued. The existence of any

26


-----

permitted liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes, as well as the
ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, not all of the Issuers’
and subsidiary guarantors’ assets secure the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

For example, the collateral will not include, among other things:

    - certain real property;

    - motor vehicles and certain commercial tort claims;

    - those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such assets would be prohibited
by applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual obligations (including leases, licenses or other
agreements, government licenses or state or local license, franchises, charters or authorizations (in each
case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable antiassignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code);

    - assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to result in material
adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by the Company;

    - “intent-to-use” trademark applications until an Amendment to Allege Use or Statement of Use has been
filed;

    - certain securitization assets; or

    - certain other limited assets.

Some of these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the
value of the collateral.

**_Rights in the collateral may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests_**
**_in collateral now or in the future._**

Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the
collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Notes Collateral
Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We and the guarantors have limited
obligations to perfect the Noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral. For example, with respect to
collateral consisting of copyrights held by the Issuers or the subsidiary guarantors on the issue date, we expect
that we will only be required to perfect the Notes Collateral Agent’s security interest in certain registered U.S.
copyrights. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a
general security interest, such as real property, certain intellectual property and certain proceeds, can only be
perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Notes Collateral Agent will not
monitor and has no obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Notes Collateral
Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will
be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the
loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes Collateral
Agent, as applicable, against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does take all actions necessary to
create properly perfected security interests, any such security interests that are perfected after the date of the
indenture would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy even
after the security interests perfected on the closing date were no longer subject to such risk.

In addition, even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired in the
future, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy
case under certain circumstances. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the
issue date increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

27


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of_**
**_the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (other than to an Issuer or a Guarantor) in a
transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the Notes;

    - in respect of the property and assets of a restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor, upon the designation
of such guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes;

    - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee;

    - so long as any First Lien Credit Agreement is outstanding, any property excluded from collateral
securing First Lien Credit Agreement, except to the extent securing any other indebtedness; and

    - pursuant to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement in the event the applicable collateral
agent is exercising remedies with respect to the collateral.

The guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in
connection with a sale of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture governing the
Notes. The indenture also permits us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of
the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for
purposes of the indenture governing the Notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any
of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released and the aggregate value of
the collateral securing the Notes will be reduced. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its
subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries that is senior to the
claim of the holders of the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and the guarantees._**

The collateral documents for the Notes will allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control
over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the Notes and the
related guarantees. In addition, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of the TIA, including,
without limitation, Section 314(d) thereof. We may, therefore, among other things, without any release or
consent by the trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to collateral permitted by the indenture
governing the Notes, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness), all of which could reduce the pool of
assets securing the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity exceeds their “issue price,” as determined under U.S.
Treasury regulations, by more than a statutory de minimis amount, the Notes will be treated as issued with
original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, in
addition to including stated interest as ordinary interest income in accordance with a U.S. Holder’s regular
method of tax accounting, each U.S. Holder must include OID in gross income as ordinary income regardless of
such U.S. Holder’s accounting method. A U.S. Holder must include OID in income as it accrues calculated on a
constant yield to maturity method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income, and will generally have to
include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of the Notes. The rules governing
instruments with OID are complex. Prospective investors should see “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” for additional information and are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
application of such rules to the Notes.

28


-----

**_If the Notes are issued with OID, and a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, the allowed claim_**
**_for the Notes may be less than the principal amount of the Notes stated in the indenture governing the_**
**_Notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the
Notes, the claim by any holder of the Notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal
to the sum of:

    - the original issue price of the Notes; and

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the Notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that
does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured
interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, holders
of the Notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal amount thereof
stated in the indenture governing the Notes.

**_If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize_**
**_value from the collateral._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess, and dispose of the collateral upon the
occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired
by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us before the Notes
Collateral Agent repossessed and disposed of the collateral (and sometimes even after). Upon the commencement
of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from
repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed
from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given or could be materially
delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though
the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given
“adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but
it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the
commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or
replacement security or superpriority administrative expense claims if and at such times as the bankruptcy court
in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for any such diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it
secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case, or the length of any delay in making such payments;

    - whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time; or

    - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss
of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given or could be materially delayed). Furthermore, in the event a
bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is

29


-----

to be paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold a secured claim only to
the extent of the value of the collateral to which the holders of the Notes are entitled and unsecured “deficiency”
claims with respect to any shortfall or undercollateralization. The Bankruptcy Code only permits the payment
and accrual of post- petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy
case to the extent the value of its collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral.

For as long as any Notes remain outstanding, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the holders of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions with respect to their ability to object to
a number of important matters or to take other actions following the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect
to the collateral prior to the discharge of the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes
and the First-Priority Notes. In particular, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose certain
limitations on the holders of the Notes with respect to their rights to seek adequate protection with respect to the
liens on the collateral, to object to proposed DIP Financing and/or the use of cash collateral that has been
consented to by the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes,
or to raise certain objections to any sale of the collateral that has been consented to by the lenders under the First
Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes. After such a filing, the value of this
collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_The security interests of the noteholders in after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a timely manner_**
**_or at all._**

If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the
indenture governing the Notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the
security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired
collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the
delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the
execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. Even if such additional actions are taken to perfect the
security interest in such after-acquired collateral, to the extent a security interest in any collateral is not perfected
on the issue date of the Notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or
otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or
any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be
avoidable in bankruptcy” below.

**_Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the_**
**_security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Certain collateral, including mortgages on certain of our real properties and after-acquired property, will be
secured after the issue date of the Notes, and certain guarantees will be granted after the issue date of the Notes.
To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes is not perfected after the issue date of the
Notes, we will use our commercially reasonably efforts to have all such security interests perfected within 120
days following the issue date of the Notes. If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to
become subject to a bankruptcy case after the issue date of the Notes, any security interest in other collateral, or
any guarantees delivered after the issue date of the Notes, would face a greater risk than security interests or
guarantees in place on the issue date (or within 30 days thereof) of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as
debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under the
Bankruptcy Code if certain events or circumstances exist or occur.

Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date (or after 30 days thereof) of the Notes
may be treated under the Bankruptcy Code as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing or
“antecedent” indebtedness. Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the
holders of the Notes, including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith

30


-----

after the date the Notes are issued, may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the
pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the
issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter
7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or
guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the
guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a year. Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file
for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the Notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the
Notes had been perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the Notes (as applicable) had been
issued, less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy case (or, if applicable, one year), such liens
or guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and
promptly recorded on the issue date of the Notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the
issue date (or within 30 days thereof) of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the
grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the
benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and may be required to return prior payments.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks, which may limit your ability to recover as a secured creditor if_**
**_there are losses to the collateral, and which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results._**

We maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards. There are, however, losses that may be
not be insured. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, we cannot assure you that any
insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the First Lien
Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Notes and related guarantees. In the event of a
total or partial loss affecting any of our assets, certain items may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even
though there may be insurance coverage, the extended period needed to obtain replacement units or inventory
may cause significant delays, which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results. In addition,
certain zoning or other laws and regulations may prevent rebuilding substantially the same facilities in the event
of a loss, which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results. Such adverse impacts may not be
covered, or fully covered, by property or business interruption insurance.

**_With respect to our real property to be mortgaged as security for the Notes, we do not expect all title_**
**_insurance policies will be in place at the time of the issuance of the Notes. Any issues that we are not able_**
**_to resolve in connection with the issuance of such title policies may impact the value of the collateral._**

We do not expect that we will have title insurance policies on the real properties to be mortgaged as security
for the Notes in place at the time of the issuance of the notes to insure, among other things, (i) loss resulting from
the entity represented by us to be the owner thereof not holding fee title in the properties and such interest being
encumbered by unpermitted liens and (ii) the validity and second lien priority of the mortgage granted to the
Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the Notes. We have
agreed to obtain title insurance on the mortgaged properties within 120 days following the issue date of the Notes
or as soon as practical thereafter using commercially reasonable efforts. In addition, if a title defect results in a
loss, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured
obligations, including the Notes.

**_State law may limit the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the real property and_**
**_improvements included in the collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on owned real property and improvements of at
least $5 million in fair market value located in several states. The laws of these states may limit the ability of the
trustee and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on the real property collateral and improvements located in such
states. State law governs the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property
interests that secure debt obligations such as the Notes. Applicable state laws may impose procedural
requirements for foreclosure different from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than the

31


-----

requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate
defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a
right of redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and one form of action rules
that can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral
regardless of the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure.

**_As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over_**
**_financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the_**
**_trading price of the notes. We have not yet completed our 2019 assessment of the effectiveness of Internal_**
**_Control Over Financial Reporting (ICFR)._**

As required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2019, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm perform an integrated audit that
includes an assessment by them of the effectiveness of ICFR. The Company has not yet completed its testing and
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s ICFR as of December 31, 2019. As the Company completes its
year end procedures, including its assessment of controls, it may determine that there are one or more significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in its ICFR.

If our senior management is unable to conclude we have effective ICFR, and our independent registered
public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our ICFR, we may not be
able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner and we could be subject to
regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and stockholders, all
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of the notes. Failure to
remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other
effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital
markets.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility, will be used to (a) redeem the outstanding $1,246 million aggregate principal amount
of Prime Notes in full and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The initial purchaser and/or its affiliates may hold the Prime Notes, and, therefore, the initial purchaser or its
affiliates may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See “Plan of Distribution”.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions,
assuming they occurred on September 30, 2019 and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. The
following table and accompanying footnotes also assume that (a) the offering of the Notes is consummated on
the terms set forth herein and (b) all outstanding Prime Notes are redeemed on February 15, 2020. The actual
sources and uses of funds may vary from the estimated sources and uses of funds in the following table and
accompanying footnotes set forth below.

(1) The As Adjusted and As Further Adjusted balance reflects a reduction in principal of approximately
$8 million due to the regularly scheduled amortization of the First Lien Term Loan Facility.
(2) The As Adjusted balance reflects (a) a draw of approximately $8 million related to the principal payment on
the First Lien Term Loan Facility and (b) a draw of approximately $220 million to partially fund the

34


-----

acquisition of Defenders in January 2020. The As Further Adjusted balance reflects an additional draw to
pay fees and expenses associated with the Transactions.
(3) The As Adjusted balance reflects the redemption of the remaining outstanding $153 million aggregate
principal amount of the ADT Notes due 2020.
(4) As of September 30, 2019, $1,246 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes were outstanding.
Assumes that the Issuers will redeem the entire outstanding $1,246 million aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Prime Notes on February 15, 2020, and pay all accrued and unpaid interest and any
applicable redemption premium on such Prime Notes to, but excluding, such date, in accordance with the
indenture governing the Prime Notes. We expect that all such accrued and unpaid interest will amount to
approximately $29 million and that all such applicable redemption premium will amount to approximately
$58 million.
The Prime Notes have a maturity date of May 15, 2023 and bear interest at 9.250% per annum. As of the
date hereof, accrued and unpaid interest on the Prime Notes was $20 million. Prior to May 15, 2020, the
Issuers may redeem the Prime Notes at their option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
(5) Excludes amounts associated with debt discount, deferred financing costs, and fair value adjustments. As of
September 30, 2019, the total amount of debt discount, deferred financing costs, and fair value adjustments
approximated $287 million. We expect this amount will increase by a) $16 million due to fees paid in
connection with the Transactions, b) the write-off of the remaining $1 million fair value adjustment on the
ADT Notes due 2020, and c) offset by approximately $9 million related to the write-off of the remaining
deferred financing costs of the Prime Notes.
(6) As of September 30, 2019, stockholders’ equity was approximately $3,711 million. We expect that this
amount will decrease by (a) $515 million due to the payment of a special dividend in December 2019 and
(b) approximately $1 million due to the redemption of the ADT Notes due 2020. These amounts are
anticipated to be offset by $161 million related to the issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition of
Defenders in January 2020. This amount will be further adjusted by $67 million related to the Transactions
as a result of the payment of a redemption premium on the Prime Notes and the write-off of the remaining
deferred financing costs on the Prime Notes.
(7) Represents outstanding shares of common stock (excluding unvested shares) of 739,892,851 at a closing
price of (a) $6.27 per share as of September 30, 2019 and (b) $6.40 per share as of January 14, 2020.
(8) Represents the aggregate of (a) total debt plus (b) market capitalization.
(9) As of September 30, 2019, cash and cash equivalents includes approximately $4 million of cash and cash
equivalents included in assets held for sale related to ADT Canada. The As Adjusted and As Further
Adjusted balances reflect a reduction in cash and cash equivalents of $155 million related to the redemption
of the ADT Notes due 2020, including the related redemption premium.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents.

**First Lien Credit Agreement**

**_General_**

The Issuer is the borrower under that certain Ninth Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement,
dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended and restated on May 2, 2016, June 23, 2016, December 28, 2016,
February 13, 2017, June 29, 2017, March 16, 2018, December 3, 2018, March 15, 2019 and September 23, 2019
(the “First Lien Credit Agreement”), consisting of:

    - a first lien term loan, in an aggregate principal amount of $3,110 million, maturing on September 23,
2026 (with a springing maturity to 90 days inside the maturity date of certain long term Indebtedness to
the extent such indebtedness is not refinanced) (the “First Lien Term Loan Facility”); and

    - a first lien revolving credit facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400 million, maturing
on March 16, 2023 (with a springing maturity to 90 days inside the maturity date of certain long term
Indebtedness to the extent such indebtedness is not refinanced) (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

As of September 30, 2019, the Issuer had borrowings of approximately $3,110 million outstanding under the
First Lien Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. After giving
effect to the Transactions, the Issuer will have borrowings of approximately $3,102 million outstanding under the
First Lien Term Loan Facility and borrowings of $245 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition: (i) under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer may request one or more incremental term
loan facilities or incremental revolving credit facilities and/or increase commitments under the First Lien Term
Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of a specified dollar
amount plus any additional amounts so long as on a pro forma basis (a) in the case of loans under such
incremental facilities secured by liens that rank pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien Credit
Agreement, the Issuer’s consolidated net first lien senior secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.20 to
1.00 and (b) in the case of loans under such incremental facilities that rank junior to the liens securing the First
Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer’s consolidated total net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.60 to
1.00. The incurrence of incremental facilities under the credit agreements governing the First Lien Credit
Agreement is subject, in each case, to certain conditions, the receipt of commitments from existing or additional
lenders and the limitations on incurring additional indebtedness applicable to the Issuer and its subsidiaries,
including under the indentures governing the Notes, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes and each other
agreement governing the Issuer’s indebtedness.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions,
including the absence of a default and the material accuracy of representations and warranties, and are available
to fund any ordinary course working capital requirements or for general corporate purposes.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option,
either (a) adjusted LIBOR determined by reference to the cost of funds for dollar deposits for the interest period
relevant to such borrowing, subject to a 1.00% floor, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of
(i) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as
the “Prime Rate” in the U.S. or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest per annum
interest rate published by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (Selected

36


-----

Interest Rates) as the “bank prime loan” rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted therein, any similar rate quoted
or any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, in each
case plus an applicable margin of (x) in the case of borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan Facility, 3.25%
for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 2.25% for Base Rate loans and (y) in the case of borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility, between 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans (in the case of the
Revolving Credit Facility, subject to one 25 basis point stepdown based on a net first lien leverage ratio).

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Issuer is
required to pay a commitment fee between 0.375% and 0.50% (determined based on a net first lien leverage
ratio) with respect to the unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Amortization and Prepayments_**

The First Lien Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in annual amounts equal to 1.0%
of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the balance payable at maturity.

In addition, the First Lien Term Loan Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loan borrowings,
subject to certain exceptions, with:

    - 50% (which percentage will be reduced if the consolidated net first lien senior secured leverage ratio is
less than or equal to certain thresholds) of the Issuer’s excess cash flow, as defined under the First Lien
Credit Agreement;

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales, other dispositions of property or
certain casualty events, in each case subject to certain exceptions and provided that the Issuer may
(a) reinvest within twelve months or (b) commit to reinvest those proceeds and so reinvest such
proceeds within 18 months in assets to be used in its business, or certain other permitted investments;
and

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under
the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**_Collateral and Guarantors_**

All obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings on a
limited-recourse basis and by each of the Issuer’s existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of the Issuer’s
capital stock and substantially all of the Issuer’s assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, including capital
stock of the subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are not
subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority
lien with respect to the collateral.

**_Restrictive Covenants and Other Matters_**

The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Issuer, subject to a testing threshold, comply as of the last
day of each fiscal quarter with a specified maximum consolidated net first lien senior secured leverage ratio. The
testing threshold will be satisfied at any time at which the sum of outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit
Facility, subject to certain exceptions, exceeds 30% of the outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility at such fiscal quarter end.

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
The negative covenants in the First Lien Credit Agreement include, among other things, limitations (none of
which are absolute) on our ability to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred equity interests; create liens

37


-----

on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make
distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with our
affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens; change
our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements in a manner materially adverse
to lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

**First-Priority Notes**

On April 4, 2019, the Issuers issued $750 million in principal amount of 5.250% First-Priority Senior
Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes) and $750 million in principal amount of 5.750% First-Priority Senior
Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In addition, on September 23, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional
$600 million in principal amount of the 2026 Notes (the “Tack-on 2026 Notes” and together with the 2024 Notes
and the 2026 Notes, the “First-Priority Notes”).

Each series of First-Priority Notes is governed by an indenture between the Issuers and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee, and we refer to these indentures (as they may have been supplemented from
time to time prior to the date hereof) collectively as the “First-Priority Notes Indentures.” Under the First-Priority
Notes Indentures, the Issuers may redeem First-Priority Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption
price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus an applicable make-whole
premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The First-Priority Notes Indentures contain covenants that, among other things and subject to a number of
qualifications and exceptions, limit the Issuers ability, and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries, to (i) create
liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and lease-back transactions; and (iii) consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In the event of a change in control triggering event (as
defined in the applicable First-Priority Notes Indentures), the Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase
such notes. The First-Priority Notes Indentures also provide for customary events of default which, if triggered,
would permit the acceleration of the debt thereunder.

In addition, the First-Priority Notes benefit from (i) guarantees by each of the Issuer’s domestic restricted
subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement, (ii) first-priority security interests, subject to
permitted liens, in substantially all of the Issuer’s existing and future assets and those of each guarantor, which
assets also secure the First Lien Credit Agreement and the ADT Notes on a first-priority basis and the Prime
Notes on a second-priority basis, and (iii) a substantially similar reporting covenant as the Prime Notes and the
ADT Notes.

**ADT Notes**

The ADT Security Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“ADTSC”), is the issuer of
each of the following series of notes, which we refer to collectively as the “ADT Notes”:

    - $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2021, which mature on
October 15, 2021;

    - $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Notes due 2022, which mature on July 15, 2022;

    - $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2023, which mature on June 15,
2023;

    - $728 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2032,
which mature on July 15, 2032; and

    - $22 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Notes due 2042, which mature on July 15, 2042.

38


-----

Each series of ADT Notes is governed by an indenture between ADTSC and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as trustee, and we refer to these indentures (as they may have been supplemented from time to time
prior to the date hereof) collectively as the “ADT Notes Indentures.” Under the ADT Notes Indentures, ADTSC
may redeem ADT Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of
the notes to be redeemed, plus an applicable make-whole premium for each series of the ADT Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The ADT Notes Indentures contain covenants that, among other things and subject to a number of
qualifications and exceptions, limit ADTSC’s ability, and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries, to (i) create
liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and lease-back transactions; and (iii) consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In the event of a change in control triggering event (as
defined in the applicable ADT Notes Indenture), ADTSC is required to make an offer to repurchase such notes.
The ADT Notes Indentures also provide for customary events of default which, if triggered, would permit the
acceleration of the debt thereunder.

In addition, the ADT Notes benefit from (i) guarantees by the Issuer and each of its domestic restricted
subsidiaries that guarantees the First Lien Credit Agreement (other than ADTSC, as the issuer of the ADT
Notes), (ii) first-priority security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of the Issuer’s existing
and future assets and those of each guarantor, which assets also secure the First Lien Credit Agreement and the
First-Priority Notes on a first-priority basis and the Prime Notes on a second-priority basis, and (iii) a
substantially similar reporting covenant as the First-Priority Notes and the Prime Notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”), and Prime

Finance Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Co-Issuer,” together with the Company, the “Issuers” and each, an
“Issuer”), will issue % Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2028 (the “notes”) under an indenture (the

“indenture”), to be entered into by and among the Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee and Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent. In this description,
(i) “we,” “us” and “our” mean the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Co-Issuer, and (ii) the term
“Issuers” refers only to the Company and the Co-Issuer, but not to any of their Subsidiaries. Copies of the
indenture, once available, may be obtained from the Issuers upon request.

The following summary of certain provisions of the indenture, the notes, the Security Documents and the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms
therein. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes” section and not otherwise defined have the
meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuers will issue notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million. Following the
Issue Date, the Issuers may issue additional notes from time to time. Any offering of additional notes is subject to
the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” The_
notes and any additional notes subsequently issued under the indenture may, at our election, be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase; provided that if the additional notes are not fungible with the notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number, if applicable. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to the notes include any
additional notes actually issued.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be payable, and the notes may be exchanged or
transferred, at the office or agency designated by the Issuers (which initially shall be the designated office or
agency of the Trustee).

The notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of
$2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration
of transfer or exchange of notes, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax
or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

**Terms of the Notes**

The notes will be senior obligations of the Issuers, will have the benefit of second priority security interests in the
Collateral described below under “—Security” and will mature on, 2028. Each note will bear interest at a
rate of % per annum from the Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for,
payable semiannually to holders of record at the close of business on or immediately preceding the
interest payment date on and of each year, commencing, 2020.

**Optional Redemption**

On or after, 2023, the Issuers may redeem the notes at their option, in whole at any time or in part
from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by the Issuers by first-class
mail to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, at the following redemption

In addition, prior to, 2023, the Issuers may redeem the notes at their option, in whole at any time
or in part from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by the Issuers by
first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2023, the Issuers may
redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving
effect to any issuance of additional notes) in an amount not to exceed the amount of net cash proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings (1) by the Company or (2) by any direct or indirect parent of the Company to the extent
the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of the Company or used to purchase
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount thereof) of %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date); provided, however, that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional notes) must remain outstanding after each such
redemption; provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such
Equity Offering is consummated upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed by the Issuers to
each holder of notes being redeemed to each such holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held
by DTC, and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture.

Notice of any redemption upon any corporate transaction or other event (including any Equity Offering,
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction) may be given prior to the completion
thereof, and any redemption or notice thereof may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a corporate transaction or other event. If any redemption is
so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition and,
if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in the Issuers’ discretion), and/or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in the Issuers’ discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed, and/or that such notice may be rescinded at any time by the Issuers if the Issuers
determine in their discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). In addition, the
Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

**Selection**

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee in
compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are
listed (and the Issuers shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if the notes are not so listed, on a pro rata

41


-----

basis to the extent practicable or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate
(and, in such manner that complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable); provided that no notes of
$2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or with respect
to global notes, to the extent permitted or required by applicable DTC procedures or regulations, sent
electronically) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be
redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent more than 60 days prior
to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the indenture or if the redemption date is delayed as described above. If any note is to be redeemed
in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the
name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date, interest will
cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuers have deposited with the
paying agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) on, the notes to be
redeemed.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect
to the notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase notes as
described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” We may at any
time, and from time to time, purchase notes in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise.

**Ranking**

The indebtedness evidenced by the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be senior Indebtedness of the
Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, respectively, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future senior Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, will have the benefit of the security
interest in the Collateral as described under “—Security” and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and
future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The notes will have the benefit of a security interest in the Collateral that will be second in priority behind
the First Lien Facility Obligations, the ADT First Lien Notes, the First-Priority Notes and all other existing and
future First Priority Lien Obligations, and pari passu in priority to all existing and future Other Second Lien
Obligations, with respect to all Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions described under
“—Security.” All of the Issuers’ Domestic Subsidiaries that are Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries and that
guarantee the First Priority Lien Obligations will become Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the notes, and
their assets and property will secure the notes to the extent described below under “—Security.”

As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuers and their
Subsidiaries would have had:

(1) $8,896 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting First Priority Lien Obligations, consisting of
(i) $3,347 million outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement (including $245 million drawn
under the revolving facility of the First Lien Credit Agreement), (ii) $3,449 million outstanding under
the ADT First Lien Notes and (iii) $2,100 million outstanding under the First-Priority Notes;

(2) approximately $80 million of Capitalized Lease Obligations;

(3) $1,300 million of outstanding Indebtedness constituting Second Priority Lien Obligations, consisting of
$1,300 million outstanding under the notes;

(4) no senior unsecured indebtedness; and

(5) no Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not Subsidiary Guarantors.

In addition, as of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuers
would have had $155 million of unutilized capacity (without giving effect to letters of credit) under the

42


-----

revolving facility of the First Lien Credit Agreement, which would constitute First Priority Lien Obligations, if
drawn.

Although the indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by
the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries, and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries
that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions. The Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries are able to Incur additional amounts of Indebtedness.
Under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to certain
limitations, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness constituting First Priority Lien Obligations or Other
Second Lien Obligations. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”_

Unless a Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary, including trade
creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including holders
of the notes. The holders of the notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to holders of indebtedness and
other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuers that
is not a Subsidiary Guarantor. As of the Issue Date, our only Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors will
be (i) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, (ii) Immaterial Subsidiaries, (iii) Foreign Subsidiaries, (iv) recently
acquired Subsidiaries that will be joined as Guarantors after the Issue Date and (v) Subsidiaries of the foregoing,
all of which, as of September 30, 2019, had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the notes—The notes will be structurally
_subordinated to all liabilities of our current and future non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

**Security for the Notes**

The notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured by second-priority security interests (subject to
Permitted Liens) in the Collateral. The Collateral consists of substantially all of the property and assets, in each
case, that are held by any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, to the extent that such assets secure the First
Priority Lien Obligations and to the extent that a second-priority security interest is able to be granted or
perfected therein, subject to the exceptions described below.

The initial Collateral does not include, subject to certain exceptions: (i) any Real Property other than
Material Real Property; (ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title and letter of credit rights
(in each case, except to the extent a Lien on such assets or such rights can be perfected by filing a UCC-1
financing statement) and commercial tort claims with a value of less than $10,000,000; (iii) assets to the extent
the pledges and security interests therein are prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or contractual
obligation permitted under the indenture, the Security Documents and certain other documents and binding on
assets to the extent in existence on the Issue Date or on the date of acquisition thereof and not entered into in
contemplation of acquisition of such asset (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable
after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or
which could require governmental (including regulatory) consent, approval, license or authorization to be
pledged (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received); (iv) assets to the extent a
security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences as
reasonably determined by the Company as set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and
Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent, provided that such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any First
Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations; (v) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness with
respect to which the cost or other consequences of pledging such Equity Interests or Indebtedness under the
Security Documents are likely to be excessive in relation to the value to be afforded thereby, as reasonably
determined by the Company as set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and Second Lien
Notes Collateral Agent, provided that such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any First Priority Lien
Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations; (vi) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any

43


-----

Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC (in each case, that is owned directly by an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) to
secure the Notes Obligations, any voting Equity Interest of such Foreign Subsidiary in excess of 65% of the
outstanding Equity Interests of such class; (vii) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any
FSHCO (in each case, that is owned directly by an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) to secure the Notes
Obligations, any voting Equity Interest of such FSHCO in excess of 65% of the outstanding Equity Interests of
such class; (viii) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness to the extent the pledge thereof would be prohibited by any
requirement of law; (ix) any Equity Interests of any Person that is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary to the extent
(A) that a pledge thereof to secure the Notes Obligations is prohibited by (i) any applicable organizational
documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder agreement or (ii) any other contractual obligation with an
unaffiliated third party not in violation of certain provisions of the indenture (other than, in this subclause (A)(ii),
customary non-assignment provisions which are ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or
other applicable requirements of law), (B) any organizational documents, joint venture agreement or shareholder
agreement (or other contractual obligation referred to in subclause (A)(ii) above) prohibits such a pledge without
the consent of any other party; provided, that this clause (B) shall not apply if (1) such other party is an Issuer,
Holdings, a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or (2) consent has been obtained to
consummate such pledge (it being understood that the foregoing shall not be deemed to obligate an Issuer or any
Subsidiary to obtain any such consent) and shall apply for so long as such organizational documents, joint
venture agreement or shareholder agreement or replacement or renewal thereof is in effect, or (C) a pledge
thereof to secure the Notes Obligations would give any other party (other than an Issuer, Holdings, a Subsidiary
Guarantor or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) to any organizational documents, joint venture agreement or
shareholder agreement governing such Equity Interests (or other contractual obligation referred to in
subclause (A)(ii) above) the right to terminate its obligations thereunder (other than, in the case of other
contractual obligations referred to in subclause (A)(ii), customary non-assignment provisions which are
ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable requirement of law); (x) any
Equity Interests of any Immaterial Subsidiary, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Special Purpose Securitization
Subsidiary; (xi) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of, or other Equity Interests owned by, a Foreign
Subsidiary; (xii) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary to the extent that the pledge of such Equity Interests
could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences to an Issuer or any Subsidiary as
reasonably determined by the Company as set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and
Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent, provided that such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any First
Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations; (xiii) any Equity Interests that are set forth on
certain schedules to the Security Documents or that have been identified on or prior to the Issue Date in writing
to the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent; (xiv) any margin stock; (xv) any lease, license, or other agreement to
the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or
create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than Holdings or any Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code; (xvi) those assets as to which the cost or other consequence of obtaining such a security
interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the value afforded thereby, as reasonably determined by
the Company as set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and Second Lien Notes Collateral
Agent, provided that such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any First Priority Lien Obligations or
Second Priority Lien Obligations; (xvii) any governmental licenses or state or local licenses, franchises, charters
and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are
prohibited or restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code; (xviii) any “intent-to-use” applications for trademark or service mark registrations
filed pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051, unless and until an Amendment to Allege
Use or a Statement of Use under Section 1(c) or 1(d) of the Lanham Act has been filed; (xix) other customary
exclusions under applicable local law or in applicable local jurisdictions set forth in the applicable Security
Documents; (xx) Securitization Assets sold to any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary or otherwise
pledged, factored, transferred or sold in connection with any Permitted Securitization Financing, and any other
assets subject to Liens securing Permitted Securitization Financings; (xxi) any segregated accounts or funds, or
any portion thereof, received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as agent on behalf of third parties in
accordance with a written agreement that imposes a duty upon the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries to

44


-----

collect and remit those funds to such third parties; (xxii) any equipment or other asset that is subject to certain
liens permitted under the indenture or is otherwise subject to a purchase money debt or a Capitalized Lease
Obligation, in each case, as permitted by certain provisions of the indenture, if the contract or other agreement
providing for such debt or Capitalized Lease Obligation prohibits or requires the consent of any person (other
than Holdings or an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) as a condition to the creation of any other security interest
on such equipment or asset and, in each case, such prohibition or requirement is permitted hereunder after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable law; and (xxiii) certain other exceptions described in the Security Documents, including the limitation
on stock collateral described below (all such excluded assets referred to as “Excluded Assets”).

The foregoing excluded property and assets do not secure any of the First Priority Lien Obligations and will
not secure the notes. The security interests securing the notes are second in priority to any and all security
interests at any time granted to secure the First Priority Lien Obligations and are also subject to all other
Permitted Liens. The First Priority Lien Obligations include the First Lien Facility Obligations and related
obligations, including certain Hedging Obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management
services, the ADT First Lien Notes and the First-Priority Notes. The Persons holding such First Priority Lien
Obligations may have rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that, if exercised,
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent to
realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Parties.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent may grant
extensions of time or waiver of the requirement for the creation or perfection of security interests or the obtaining
of insurance (including title insurance or surveys with respect to particular assets) (including extensions beyond
the Issue Date for the perfection of security interests in the assets of the Issuers or the Subsidiary Guarantors on
such date) where it reasonably determines, in consultation with the Company, that perfection or the obtaining of
such items cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would
otherwise be required by the indenture or the other Security Documents, (B) no control agreement or control,
lockbox or similar arrangement shall be required with respect to any deposit accounts, securities accounts or
commodities accounts, (C) no landlord, mortgagee or bailee waivers shall be required, (D) no foreign-law
governed security documents or perfection under foreign law shall be required and (E) no notice shall be required
to be sent to account debtors or other contractual third parties prior to an Event of Default.

The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors are able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could
share in the Collateral, including additional First Priority Lien Obligations that would be secured by Liens on the
Collateral that rank senior to the Liens thereon securing the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, and Other
Second Lien Obligations that would be secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank pari passu with the Liens
thereon securing the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees. The amount of such First Priority Lien Obligations,
Other Second Lien Obligations and additional Indebtedness is limited by the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of such First_
Priority Lien Obligations and Other Second Lien Obligations could be significant.

**Limitations on Stock Collateral**

The Capital Stock and securities of a Subsidiary that are owned by any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
will constitute Collateral only to the extent that such Capital Stock and securities can secure the notes or the
applicable Subsidiary Guarantees, as applicable, without Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
(or any other law, rule or regulation) requiring separate financial statements of such Subsidiary to be filed with
the SEC (or any other governmental agency). In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act requires or is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or
regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any
other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary due to the fact

45


-----

that such person’s Capital Stock or securities secure the notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee, then the Capital
Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral (but only
to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to
such requirement). In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of
the Trustee or any holder of notes, to the extent necessary to release the security interests on the shares of Capital
Stock and securities that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral. Since the notes do not have
registration rights, this limitation will not limit the Collateral on the Issue Date.

In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted
by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is
adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities to secure the notes in excess of the
amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial
statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be
deemed to be a part of the Collateral (but only to the extent that it will not result in such Subsidiary being subject
to any such financial statement requirement). In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or
modified, without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of notes, to the extent necessary to subject to the Liens
under the Security Documents such additional Capital Stock and securities, on the terms contemplated herein.

You may not have a perfected security interest in all of the Collateral as of the Issue Date. For example,
some or all of the Mortgages needed to cause the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees to be secured thereby may
not be in place upon the issuance of the notes. However, to the extent that any such instrument or deliverable is
required to be delivered, the Issuers will be required to use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such
instruments and related deliverables within 120 days following the Issue Date or such longer period of time as
agreed to by the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent with respect to perfecting security interests in such
Collateral thereunder. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Delivery of
security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the security interests or
such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**After-Acquired Collateral**

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor creates any
additional security interest upon any property or asset (other than Excluded Assets) to secure any First Priority
Lien Obligations (which include Obligations in respect of the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT First Lien
Notes and the First-Priority Notes) or any Other Second Lien Obligations, it must concurrently grant a secondpriority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens, including the first priority lien that secures obligations in
respect of the First Priority Lien Obligations) in favor of the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit
and the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes and deliver certain joinder agreements and certificates
in respect thereof to the extent required by the Security Documents.

**Further Assurances**

The Security Documents and the indenture provide that the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall, at
their expense, duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further agreements,
documents, instruments, financing and continuation statements and amendments thereto and do or cause to be
done such further acts as may be necessary or proper to evidence, perfect, maintain and enforce the security
interests and the priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the Second-Priority Collateral Agent for its benefit
and for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the Trustee, and to otherwise effectuate the provisions or
purposes of the indenture and the Security Documents.

**Security Documents**

The Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Security Documents defining the terms of the
security interests that secure the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Other Second Lien Obligations.

46


-----

These security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the
Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the indenture and the Security
Documents, as provided in the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the notes (other than as set forth in
the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income
therefrom.

The Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent or the trustee will only be permitted, subject to the terms of the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, applicable law and the next sentence, to exercise remedies and
sell the Collateral at the direction of the holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the notes and
Other Second Lien Obligations. The Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent and the trustee, as applicable, shall be
authorized to take, but shall not be required to take, such actions with regard to a default or an event of default
which the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent and the trustee, in good faith, believe to be reasonably required to
promote and protect the interests of the holders of the notes and the holders of Other Second Lien Obligations
and to preserve the value of the Collateral. Any action taken or not taken without the vote of any holder of notes
or holder of Other Second Lien Obligations pursuant to and in accordance with the remedies section of the
Security Documents and the indenture shall nevertheless be binding on such party.

**First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The Applicable First Lien Agent and the other parties thereto are party to the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”), with respect to the Collateral that may be amended or
supplemented from time to time without the consent of the Trustee, the holders of the notes or any other Second
Lien Secured Party to add other parties holding First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien
Obligations not prohibited to be incurred under the indenture, the First Lien Credit Agreement, the agreements
governing any other First Priority Lien Obligations and the agreements governing any Other Second Lien
Obligations.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will execute and deliver a joinder to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement in the capacity of the Applicable Second Lien Agent.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, at any time prior to the
Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, the Applicable First Lien Agent and other representatives of the
First Priority Lien Obligations will have the exclusive right to enforce rights and exercise remedies with respect
to the Collateral subject to other provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

So long as the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Applicable Second Lien
Agent, the holders of the notes or any other Second Lien Secured Party will not be permitted to exercise any
rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to the Collateral even if an Event of Default
under the indenture has occurred and the notes have been accelerated, except the Applicable Second Lien Agent
may take certain specified permitted remedies, including to:

(a) take certain protective measures described in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,

(b) exercise rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral after a period of 180 days has elapsed since
the delivery of the notice of the acceleration of the applicable Second Priority Lien Obligations to the
Applicable First Lien Agent, if no holder of First Priority Lien Obligations is diligently pursuing the
enforcement or exercise of rights or remedies with respect to a material portion of Collateral or
requested a relief of any stay to enable commencement of such exercise, any such acceleration has not
been rescinded and no Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor is then a debtor in any insolvency proceeding,

47


-----

(c) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim,
adversary proceeding, or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the
disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Second Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured
by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement,

(d) file any pleadings, objections motions, or agreements that assert rights or interests available to
unsecured creditors of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor arising under either any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with or
prohibited by the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or applicable law
(including the bankruptcy laws of an applicable jurisdiction), or

(e) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim,
make other filings and make any arguments, obligations, and motions (including in support of or
opposition to, as applicable, the confirmation or approval of any plan of reorganization or similar
dispositive restructuring plan) that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the First Lien/
Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain limited rights, the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent will agree that it will not take any
action that would hinder or interfere with any exercise of remedies undertaken by any holder of First Priority
Lien Obligations with respect to the Collateral and the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent will waive any and
all rights it or any such Second Lien Secured Party may have as a junior lien creditor or otherwise to object to the
manner in which any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations seeks to enforce or collect the First Priority Lien
Obligations or the Liens granted to secure any First Priority Lien Obligations, regardless of whether any action or
failure to act by such holder is adverse to the interests of the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations
(including the holders of the notes).

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time any Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations delivers notice to the Applicable Second
Lien Agent that any specified Collateral held by such Person (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof) is
disposed of (other than to an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) (i) by the owner of such Collateral in a transaction
not prohibited under the documents governing First Priority Lien Obligations and Second Priority Lien
Obligations or (ii) during the existence of any Event of Default under (and as defined in) the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any applicable documents governing other First Priority Lien Obligations in connection with any
enforcement action, exercise of rights or remedies or to the extent that the Applicable First Lien Agent has
consented to such disposition, then the Liens securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations upon such Collateral
will automatically be released and discharged as and upon, but only to the extent, such Liens on such Collateral
securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are released and discharged.

In addition, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Discharge of First
Priority Lien Obligations, except as provided in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement (1) the
holders of First Priority Lien Obligations and the Applicable First Lien Agent shall have the exclusive right to
make determinations regarding the release of Collateral without the consent of any Second Lien Secured Parties,
(2) the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be supplemented, without the consent of the
Applicable Second Lien Agent, the holders of the notes or any other Second Lien Secured Party, to add
additional secured creditors holding First Priority Lien Obligations and Other Second Lien Obligations so long as
such First Priority Lien Obligations or Other Second Lien Obligations, as applicable, are not prohibited by the
provisions of the First Lien Credit Agreement, the indenture, the documents governing any other First Priority
Lien Obligations or the documents governing any Other Second Lien Obligations and (2) in the event the holders
of the First Priority Lien Obligations change, waive, modify or vary the security documents governing the First
Priority Lien Obligations, such modification will automatically apply to the comparable provisions of the
Security Documents without the consent of any holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations, provided that
any such change, waiver or modification does not materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of the

48


-----

Second Priority Lien Obligations to a greater extent than the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations in a
like or similar manner.

In addition if any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the
Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent will agree, that:

(1) until the Discharge of First-Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Applicable First Lien Agent
shall desire to permit the use, sale or lease of cash collateral or to permit such Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor to obtain financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar
provision in any bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”), then it will not object to, or support any objection
to or otherwise contest, and will be deemed to have consented to, such use, sale or lease of such cash
collateral and DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection
therewith (except to the extent permitted by clause 7 below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the
First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will
subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto,
including any “carve-out” from the Collateral granting administrative priority status or Lien priority to
secure the payment of fees and expenses of the United States Trustee or professionals retained by any
debtor or creditors’ committee agreed to by the Applicable First Lien Agent or the other holders of
First Priority Lien Obligations) and to any adequate protection Liens granted to the Applicable First
Lien Agent, on the same basis as the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated
to the Liens securing the DIP Financing; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of the DIP
Financing does not exceed the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of the First Priority Lien Obligations
(after taking into account any “roll-up” thereof) and (2) an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate
commitments (whether drawn or undrawn) under such then existing revolving credit facilities, in each
case determined as of the commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

(2) it will raise no objection to, and will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any motion for
relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of
any First Priority Lien Obligations made by the Applicable First Lien Agent or any holder of First
Priority Lien Obligations;

(3) it will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any lawful exercise by
the Applicable First Lien Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations of the right to credit bid
the First Priority Lien Obligations under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision
under any other applicable bankruptcy law) or at any sale in foreclosure or in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding of the Collateral or other collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations;

(4) it will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any other request for
judicial relief made in any court by the Applicable First Lien Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien
Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on any Collateral or other Collateral
securing any First Priority Lien Obligations;

(5) it will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any order relating to
a sale of any Collateral of any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor for which the Applicable First Lien
Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations has consented that provides, to the extent that the
sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations and the
Second Priority Lien Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as
the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations do relate to the Liens securing the Second Priority
Lien Obligations in accordance with the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, provided that
the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations may assert any
objection to the proposed bidding or related sale procedures to be utilized in connection with a sale or
disposition that could be asserted by an unsecured creditor in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(6) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, it will not (i) seek relief from the
automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Collateral

49


-----

or any other collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations without the prior written consent of
the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations or as otherwise set forth in the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) oppose the Applicable First Lien Agent or any holder of First Priority
Lien Obligations from seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay;

(7) none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (a) any request by the Applicable
First Lien Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations for adequate protection in any form or
(b) any objection by the Applicable First Lien Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to
any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the Applicable First Lien Agent’s or the holders of
First Priority Lien Obligations’ claiming a lack of adequate protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations (or any
subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement
collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of
cash collateral under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the
Applicable Second Lien Agent and any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations (A) may seek or
request adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), which Lien or superpriority claim is junior and
subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for, and claims with respect to,
the First Priority Lien Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the
same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and
subordinated to the Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations
under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (B) will not seek or request, without the
consent of the Applicable First Lien Agent or as otherwise set forth in the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, adequate protection in any other form, and (ii) in the event that the Applicable
Second Lien Agent or any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations seeks or requests adequate
protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement
collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed
that the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall also be granted a senior Lien on such
additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the applicable First Priority
Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing and/or a superpriority administrative claim (as
applicable), and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing or providing
adequate protection for the Second Priority Lien Obligations and/or a superpriority claim shall be
junior and subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing, and the claims with respect to, the
First Priority Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and
any other Liens granted to the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations as adequate protection on the
same basis as the other Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the Second Priority Lien
Obligations are so junior and subordinated to such Liens securing, and claims with respect to, the First
Priority Lien Obligations under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to the extent the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations are granted
adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition interest, fees, and
expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of
Second Priority Lien Obligations shall not be prohibited from seeking and accepting adequate
protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition interest, fees, and expenses,
and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the Applicable First Lien Agent or
the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and
expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of
Second Priority Lien Obligations; and

(8) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, it (i) will not assert or enforce any
claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other
applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Priority Lien
Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral or other collateral, and
(ii) will waive any claim it may have arising out of the election by any holder of First Priority Lien

50


-----

Obligations of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision
under any other applicable bankruptcy law).

In addition, under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of Second Priority Lien
Obligations (including the holders of the notes) may support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or
similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (and shall be deemed
to have voted to reject any such plan) unless it (a) pays off, in cash in full, all First Priority Lien Obligations,
(b) is accepted by the class of holders of First Priority Lien Obligations voting thereon in accordance with
Section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law), or
(c) otherwise provides the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations with the value of the Collateral in cash or
otherwise, prior to any payment or distribution on account of the Second Priority Lien Obligations (subject to a
certain other provision of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement).

The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the parties thereto agree, and the
Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent will agree, that (i) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents
and the security documents governing the First Priority Lien Obligations constitute two separate and distinct
grants of Liens and (ii) because of their differing rights in the Collateral, the Second Priority Lien Obligations
must be separately classified from the First Priority Lien Obligations in any plan of reorganization or similar
dispositive restructuring plan proposed or confirmed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The parties
thereto further agree, and the Trustee will agree, that regardless of whether any claim for interest, fees, costs, or
expenses that accrue after the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding is allowed or allowable,
the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement expressly is intended to include and does include the “rule of
explicitness” in that the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement expressly entitles the Applicable First
Lien Agent and the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations with the right to receive, in respect of the First
Priority Lien Obligations, payment from the Collateral of all such post-petition claims through distributions made
therefrom pursuant to the provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, even if any such
post-petition claims are not allowed or allowable against the bankruptcy estate of any Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law. If it is held that the claims of the
holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations and the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations in respect of
the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims),
then the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the amounts
distributed to them from, or in respect of, the Collateral in respect of principal, prepetition interest, and other
claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition claims, irrespective of whether any claim for such amounts
is allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, before any distribution from, or in respect
of, any Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien Secured Parties, with the holders of
the Second Lien Secured Parties acknowledging and agreeing in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement to turn over to the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations amounts otherwise received or
receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of the foregoing, even if
such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the Second Lien Secured Parties.

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors are entitled to the automatic release of property and other assets
included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes Obligations under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the consummation of any
transaction permitted by the indenture as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a
Subsidiary of the Issuers or otherwise ceases to be a pledgor under the Security Documents;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, upon the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations and
concurrent release of all other Liens on such property or assets securing First Priority Lien Obligations
(including all commitments and letters of credit thereunder); provided, however, that if any Issuer or

51


-----

Subsidiary Guarantor subsequently incurs First Priority Lien Obligations that are secured by Liens on
property or assets of any Issuer of the type constituting the Collateral and the related Liens are incurred
in reliance on clause (6)(B) of the definition of Permitted Liens, then the Issuers will be required to
reinstitute the security arrangements with respect to the Collateral in favor of the notes, which, in the
case of any such subsequent First Priority Lien Obligations, will be second priority Liens on the
Collateral securing such First Priority Lien Obligations to the same extent provided by the Security
Documents and on the terms and conditions of the security documents relating to such First Priority
Lien Obligations, with the second priority Lien held either by the administrative agent, collateral agent
or other representative for such First Priority Lien Obligations or by a collateral agent or other
representative designated by the Issuers to hold the second priority Liens for the benefit of the holders
of the notes and subject to a First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement that provides the
administrative agent or collateral agent substantially the same rights and powers as afforded under the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) to enable the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor to consummate the disposition of such property or
assets to a Person that is not an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent not prohibited under the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales”;

(4) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of such Subsidiary
Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted
Subsidiary”;

(5) in respect of the property or assets of an Issuer, upon the release or discharge of such Issuer’s Notes
Obligations in accordance with the indenture;

(6) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or discharge of the
Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the indenture;

(7) in respect of any property and assets securing the First Priority Lien Obligations, upon the release of
the security interests securing such assets or property securing any First Priority Lien Obligations,
other than in connection with a Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations;

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below;

(9) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) in respect of any property and assets that are or become Excluded Assets pursuant to a transaction not
prohibited under the indenture;

(11) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or discharge of the
pledge granted by such Subsidiary Guarantor to secure the obligations under the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness the guarantee in respect of which resulted in the obligation to
become a Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the notes; and

(12) upon any sale or other transfer by the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any Collateral that is
permitted under the indenture to any Person that is not an Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor (including
in connection with a condemnation or casualty event), or upon the effectiveness of any written consent
to the release of the security interest granted by the Security Documents in any Collateral pursuant to
the indenture.

If an Event of Default under the indenture exists on the date of Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations,
the second priority Liens on the Collateral securing the notes will not be released pursuant to clause (2) of the
foregoing paragraph, except to the extent the Collateral or any portion thereof was disposed of in order to repay
the First Priority Lien Obligations secured by the Collateral (but in such event, the Liens on the Collateral
securing the notes will be released when such Event of Default and any other Event of Default under the
indenture cease to exist).

52


-----

The second priority security interests in all Collateral securing the notes also will be released upon
(i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if
any) on, the notes and all other Obligations under the indenture and the Security Documents that are due and
payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including additional
interest, if any), are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as described below
under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the indenture as
described below under “—Defeasance.”

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

Each of the Issuers’ direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are Domestic
Subsidiaries (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) and that are borrowers or guarantors under the First Lien Credit
Agreement will jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a senior basis the performance
and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of
the Issuers under the indenture and the notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantors
being herein called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Guaranteed Obligations of all Subsidiary Guarantors will
be secured by second-priority security interests (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral owned by such
Subsidiary Guarantor. The Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any
and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee in enforcing any rights
under the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to
such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the
Notes and guarantees and the related security interests, and require holders of Notes to return payments
received.” After the Issue Date, the Issuers will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) that Incurs or guarantees certain Indebtedness of an
Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to execute and deliver to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which such Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes on the same
senior secured basis and (ii) joinders to or new Security Documents and take all actions required by the Security
Documents to perfect the Liens created thereunder. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the
Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Subsidiary Guarantor and its
successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees
and assigns.

Each Subsidiary’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically released upon any of the following:

(1) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock
(including any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer following which the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary), of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale,
disposition, exchange or other transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the indenture;

53


-----

(2) (i) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii) the occurrence of any other event following which such
Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in a manner not in violation of the indenture;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the First Lien Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the notes;

(4) the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance” or if the Issuers’ obligations under the indenture are discharged in accordance with the
terms of the indenture;

(5) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security
interest securing First Lien Priority Obligations and Second Lien Priority Obligations or other exercise
of remedies in respect thereof;

(6) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with and into an Issuer
or another Subsidiary Guarantor or upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in
each case, in a manner not in violation of the indenture; and

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the Issuers to
repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date), except to the extent the Issuers have previously or concurrently elected to redeem notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption.”

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control, the terms of any Bank Indebtedness restrict or
prohibit the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant, then within 30 days following any Change of Control,
the Issuers shall:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness or, if doing so will allow the purchase of notes, offer to repay in full
all Bank Indebtedness and repay the Bank Indebtedness of each lender and/or noteholder who has
accepted such offer; or

(2) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing the Bank Indebtedness to permit the
repurchase of the notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraphs.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase
the Notes upon a change of control.”

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have exercised their
right to redeem the notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the
Issuers shall mail to each holder’s registered address, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, with a copy to the
Trustee, a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuers to
repurchase such holder’s notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the
right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

54


-----

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed or delivered electronically), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control
Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below (in which case the expected
repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that
is expected to result in the Change of Control and which may be tolled until the closing of such
transaction); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in
order to have its notes purchased.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the
Change of Control Offer.

In addition, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and
purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third party making a Change of
Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchase all of the notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer described above, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption.

Notes repurchased by the Issuers pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of notes issued
but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuers. Notes purchased by a third party
pursuant to the preceding paragraphs will have the status of notes issued and outstanding.

The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this
covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this
covenant, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached their obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof.

This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations among the Issuers and the initial
purchasers. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control,
although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed
below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings,
securitizations or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but
that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuers’ capital
structure or credit rating.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the
First Lien Credit Agreement. Future Bank Indebtedness of the Issuers may contain prohibitions on certain events
which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Bank Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change
of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the notes upon
a Change of Control could cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself

55


-----

does not cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuers. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuers’
then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or
substantially all” the assets of the Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” under New York law, which governs the indenture,
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder
of notes to require the Issuers to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the
assets of the Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the indenture. If on any date
following the Issue Date, (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no
Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture then, beginning on such date (the occurrence of the
events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
Event”), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of
this offering memorandum will not be applicable to the notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or
_Substantially All Assets”; and_

(7) “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

If and while the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the
notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuers and their Restricted
Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture for any period of time as a result of
the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw
their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating,
then the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants
under the indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event
and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Issuers will provide the
Trustee with notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date within five Business Days of the
occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor or provide notice to the holders of the notes of any
such Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during
the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” below or

56


-----

one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” below (to the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or_
Preferred Stock would be permitted to be Incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving
effect to Indebtedness Incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date).
To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock would not be so permitted to be
Incurred or issued pursuant to the first or second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock_
will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of
the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted_
Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments.” As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the_
Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuers or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension
Period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, the Issuers must comply with the terms of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

For purposes of the “—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds
amount will be reset to zero.

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The indenture will provide that:

(1) the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock;
and

(2) the Issuers will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor) to
issue any shares of Preferred Stock;

_provided, however, that the Issuers and any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers that is not a
Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified
Stock or issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuers for the
most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements have been made available
immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
_forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the_
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds
therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided, further, that any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor may not Incur Indebtedness or issue shares of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in excess of an amount, together with any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof pursuant to clause
(o) below, not to exceed, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence or issuance (including pro forma effect
to the application of the net proceeds therefrom), the greater of $475.0 million and 17.0% of the Pro Forma
EBITDA of the Issuers for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements have
been made available immediately preceding such date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred, or
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such event
occurred at the beginning of such four fiscal quarters (plus, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the
Additional Refinancing Amount).

57


-----

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(a) the Incurrence by either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness (including under any First
Lien Credit Agreement and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at the time of Incurrence that, together
with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof Incurred pursuant to clause (o) below, does not
exceed an amount equal to the sum of (x) $3,510.0 million, plus (y) an amount that does not exceed the
greater of $970.0 million and 35% of the Pro Forma EBITDA of the Issuers for the most recently ended
four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements have been made available immediately
preceding such date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred and after giving pro forma
effect thereto as if such event occurred at the beginning of such four fiscal quarters, plus (z) an
additional aggregate principal amount of Consolidated Total Indebtedness that at the time of Incurrence
does not cause either (I) the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements have been made available, determined on a pro forma basis, to
exceed 3.20 to 1.00 or (II) if such Indebtedness is Incurred in connection with an acquisition or
Investment, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for
which financial statements have been made available, determined on a pro forma basis giving effect to
such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or Investment, to exceed the Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio in effect immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
Investment (plus, in each case, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing
Amount); provided that for purposes of determining the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred
under this clause (a)(z), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (a)(z) (or any Refinancing
Indebtedness thereof pursuant to clause (o) below) shall be treated as Secured Indebtedness constituting
First Priority Lien Obligations;

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors of Indebtedness, including Indebtedness
represented by the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, up to, together with any Refinancing
Indebtedness thereof pursuant to clause (o) below, an aggregate principal amount outstanding at the
time of Incurrence that does not exceed $1,300.0 million (plus, in the case of any Refinancing
Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount);

(c) Indebtedness existing on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (a), (b) and (aa));

(d) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by either Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, Disqualified Stock issued by either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and Preferred Stock
issued by any Restricted Subsidiary to finance (whether prior to or within 270 days after) the
acquisition, lease, construction, repair, replacement or improvement of property (real or personal) or
equipment (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning
such assets) in an aggregate principal amount that, when aggregated with the principal amount or
liquidation preference of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock then outstanding
and Incurred pursuant to this clause (d), together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof

(plus, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof)
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness described in clauses
(a) through (aa) above (or any portion thereof) or is entitled to be Incurred or issued pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant, then the Issuers may, in their sole discretion, divide, classify or
reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later time), such item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness outstanding under (i) the First Lien Credit
Agreement on the Issue Date shall be incurred under clause (a)(x) above and may not be reclassified,
(ii) the notes on the Issue Date shall be incurred under clause (b) above and may not be reclassified,
(iii) the First-Priority Notes outstanding on the Issue Date shall be incurred under clause (aa)(i) above
and may not be reclassified and (iv) the ADT First Lien Notes outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
incurred under clause (aa)(ii) above and may not be reclassified;

-----

(2) at the time of Incurrence, division, classification or reclassification, the Issuers will be entitled to divide
and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in the
first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (a) through (aa) above (or any portion thereof) without
giving pro forma effect to the Indebtedness Incurred, divided, classified or reclassified pursuant to any
other clause or paragraph above (or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Indebtedness
that may be Incurred, divided, classified or reclassified pursuant to any such clause or paragraph (or
any portion thereof) at such time; and

(3) in connection with the Incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of (x) revolving loan Indebtedness under
this covenant or (y) any commitment relating to the Incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under this covenant, and the granting of any Lien to secure such
Indebtedness, the Issuers or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Incurrence or
issuance and the granting of any Lien therefor as having occurred on the date of first Incurrence of such
revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related
subsequent actual Incurrence or issuance and granting of such Lien therefor will be deemed for all
purposes under the indenture to have been Incurred or issued and granted on such Deemed Date,
including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, usage of any
baskets hereunder (if applicable), the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and
EBITDA (and all such calculations on and after the Deemed Date until the termination or funding of
such commitments shall be made on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the deemed Incurrence or
issuance, the granting of any Lien therefor and related transactions in connection therewith).

Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, amortization of original issue
discount, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations
in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness;
_provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may_
be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar
equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of the refinancing, the U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness
being refinanced.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with
respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The
principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.

indirect parent of the Company;

Average Life to Maturity that would result if all payments of principal on the Subordinated
Indebtedness being redeemed, repurchased, defeased, acquired or retired that were due on or after

instead due on such date;

(5) the declaration and payment of dividends or distributions to holders of any class or series of
Disqualified Stock of any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary issued or incurred in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified

subject to tax at the highest combined marginal federal, state, and/or local income tax rate

loss to be available to reduce taxes in the current taxable period (taking into account any
limitations on the utilization of such loss to reduce such taxes and assuming such loss had not
already been utilized) and the character (e.g., long-term or short-term capital gain or ordinary or
exempt) of the applicable income);

(13) any Restricted Payment, if applicable:

(a) in amounts required for any direct or indirect parent of the Company to pay fees and expenses
(including franchise or similar taxes) required to maintain its corporate existence, customary

with a consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that complies with the covenant described under “Merger,
Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; provided that as a result of such
consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of assets, the Issuers shall have made a Change of Control
Offer (if required by the indenture) and that all notes tendered by holders in connection with such Change of
Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value; and

Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which financial
statements have been made available immediately preceding such Restricted Payment is not greater
than 3.15 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis;

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clauses_
(6)(b), (10), (11) and (19), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof; provided, further, that any Restricted Payments made with property other than cash shall be
calculated using the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Issuers) of such property.

69


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof)
or Permitted Investments (or any portion thereof) described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof but may
be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion
thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of
permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any portion thereof) described
in the above clauses or the definitions thereof, the Issuers may, in their sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify,
or later divide, classify or reclassify, such permitted Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted
Investment (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of division,
classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Restricted Payment (or
any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of permitted Restricted
Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any portion thereof) described in the above clauses
or the definitions thereof.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to a Restricted Payment
or Investment, the Issuers or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Restricted Payment or
Investment as having occurred on the date of the commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating
thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment or Investment
and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuers or any of
their Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on the relevant Election Date
in compliance with the indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such Investment will be deemed
for all purposes under the indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including, without limitation, for
purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and
EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such
calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or
rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis
giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuers will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuers will
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
all outstanding Investments by the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the
last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment
or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets
the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (1) on its
Capital Stock; or (2) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits; or
(ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make loans or advances to either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to either Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

except in each case for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) (i) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date (including, without limitation,
pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement), (ii) contractual encumbrances or restrictions pursuant to

70


-----

the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Agreement Documents, (iii) contractual encumbrances or
restrictions pursuant to the indentures governing the First-Priority Notes and the ADT First Lien Notes,
and (iv) in each case, any similar contractual encumbrances or restrictions or any amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of such
agreements or instruments;

(2) the indenture, the notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(4) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
which was in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof or to
provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition),
which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any
Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its
Subsidiaries, so acquired;

(5) contracts or agreements for the sale of assets, including any restriction with respect to a Restricted
Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of the Capital
Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenants described under
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”
and “—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(7) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business;

(8) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(9) purchase money obligations for property acquired and Capitalized Lease Obligations in the ordinary
course of business that impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (c) above on the property
so acquired;

(10) customary provisions contained in leases, licenses and other similar agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm;

(11) in the case of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant, any encumbrance or restriction that
restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is
subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license
(including without limitations, licenses of intellectual property) or other contracts;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction of a Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary effected in connection
with a Permitted Securitization Financing; provided, however, that such restrictions apply only to such
Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary;

(13) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (a) of either Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary or (b) of any Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary so long as such encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument will not materially affect the Issuers’ ability to
make anticipated principal or interest payments on the notes (as determined in good faith by the
Issuers), provided that in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date by the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(14) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” and any Permitted Investment; or

71


-----

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above imposed by any
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (14)
above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuers, not materially
more restrictive with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in
the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement,
renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on
common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the
subordination of loans or advances made to an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by
an Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or
advances.

**_Asset Sales_**

(a) The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith
by the Issuers) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of, and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor
received by such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents;
_provided that the amount of:_

(1) any liabilities (as shown on an Issuer’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the
notes thereto) of an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated to the notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such
transferee,

(2) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by such Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash within 180 days of the receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash received),

(3) Indebtedness of any Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer an Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the other Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the
Asset Sale,

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not an Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, and

(5) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Issuers), taken
together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $150.0 million and 5.0% of the Pro Forma EBITDA
of the Issuers for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements have
been made available immediately preceding the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration
and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such event occurred at the beginning of such four fiscal
quarters (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value),

shall in each case be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

72


-----

(b) Within 365 days after any Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of any
Asset Sale, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its
option:

(1) to repay (i) Indebtedness constituting First Priority Lien Obligations (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is
revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), (ii)
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, (iii) Notes Obligations or
(iv) other Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than First Priority Lien Obligations) (provided that if an
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall so reduce Obligations under other Pari Passu Indebtedness
pursuant to this sub-clause (iv) that does not constitute First Priority Lien Obligations (which does not
include indebtedness described in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), even if such indebtedness may also
constitute Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers will equally and ratably reduce Notes Obligations as
provided under “Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases
are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, in the event that the notes were issued with
significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) or by making an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase a pro
rata principal amount of notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in
the event that the notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value
thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any); or

(2) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of
the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers or in an increase in the percentage ownership by the Issuers (or a
Restricted Subsidiary) in such Restricted Subsidiary), assets, or property or capital expenditures, in
each case (a) used or useful in a Similar Business or (b) that replace the properties and assets that are
the subject of such Asset Sale or in each case to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on
or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Proceeds was contractually committed.

(c) In the case of clause (b)(2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of
the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the 18-month anniversary of the date of the receipt of
such Net Proceeds; provided that in the event such binding commitment is later canceled or terminated for any
reason before such Net Proceeds are so applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment (a “Second Commitment”)
within six months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding commitment; provided, further, that
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may only enter into a Second Commitment under the foregoing
provision one time with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such Second Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied or are not applied within 180 days of such
Second Commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in
any manner not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in paragraph (b) of this covenant (it being understood that any
portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (b)(1) above, shall
be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million, the Issuers shall make an_
offer to all holders of notes (and, at the option of the Issuers, to holders of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness) (an
“Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (and such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness), that is at least $2,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof
(or, in the event the notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness were issued with significant original issue discount,
100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such other Pari Passu

73


-----

Indebtedness) to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the indenture. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten
(10) Business Days after the date that the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million by
mailing, or delivering electronically if held by DTC, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the indenture,
with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of notes (and such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuers may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose that is not prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of notes (and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness) surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Trustee, upon receipt of notice from the Issuers of the aggregate principal amount to be
selected, shall select the notes to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the indenture by
virtue thereof.

If more notes (and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness) are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the
Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such notes for purchase will be made by the Trustee in compliance
with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed (and the
Issuers shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the
extent practicable, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such
manner as complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable); provided that no notes of $2,000 or less shall
be purchased in part. Selection of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be made pursuant to the terms of such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by the Issuers by first class mail, postage prepaid to each
holder of notes at such holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held at DTC, at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the purchase date. If any note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase
that relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or
assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of
transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any
Affiliate of the Issuers (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in
excess of $33.0 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the relevant Issuer or
Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by such
Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $70.0 million, the Issuers deliver to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good
faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Company, approving such Affiliate Transaction
and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause
(a) above.

76


-----

(ii) the investment constitutes less than 5% of the proposed or outstanding issue amount of such class
of securities.

**_Liens_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of their Restricted Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist (i) any Lien (except Permitted Liens) on any asset or
property of any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary securing Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
or (ii) any Lien securing any First Priority Lien Obligation of any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor without
effectively providing that the notes or the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the notes, as the
case may be, shall be granted a second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon the assets or
property constituting the collateral for such First Priority Lien Obligations, except as set forth under “—Security
for the Notes”; provided, however, that if granting such security interests requires the consent of a third party, the
Issuers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent with respect to the security interests for
the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the notes; provided, further, however, that if such
third party does not consent to the granting of such security interests after the use of commercially reasonable
efforts, the Issuers will not be required to provide such security interests.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or
any portion thereof) need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination
thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
(or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Issuers may, in their sole discretion, divide, classify
or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later time), such Lien securing such item
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of
Incurrence, division, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such
Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of
permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” and, in such event, such
Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be treated as being Incurred or existing
pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma effect to such item (or
portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) that may be
Incurred pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or portion thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to
any revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment relating to the Incurrence of Indebtedness that is designated to
be Incurred on any date pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” any Lien
that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by the Issuers or any Restricted
Subsidiary to be Incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent actual Incurrence of such Lien
shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be Incurred on such prior date, including for purposes of
calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien” until such time as the related Indebtedness is no longer deemed
outstanding pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms or in
the form of common stock of an Issuer, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock in the form of additional
shares of Preferred Stock of the same class, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness described in clause (3) of the definition of
“Indebtedness.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The indenture will provide that so long as any notes are outstanding, the Issuers will provide to the Trustee
and, upon request, to beneficial owners a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for non-accelerated
filers, annual reports of the Reporting Entity (as defined below) for such fiscal year containing the
information that would have been required to be contained in an annual report on Form 10-K (or any
successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the
Exchange Act, except to the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for non-accelerated
filers, quarterly reports of the Reporting Entity for such fiscal quarter containing the information that
would have been required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q (or any successor or
comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act,
except to the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for filing current
reports on Form 8-K, current reports of the Reporting Entity containing substantially all of the
information that would be required to be filed in a Current Report on Form 8-K under the Exchange
Act on the Issue Date pursuant to Sections 1, 2 and 4, Items 5.01, 5.02 (a)-(d) (other than compensation
information), 5.03(b) and Item 9.01 (only to the extent relating to any of the foregoing) of Form 8-K if
the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
no such current reports will be required to be furnished if the Issuers determine in their good faith
judgment that such event is not material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position
or prospects of the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

If at any time the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company has made a good faith
determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an initial public offering of such
Person’s Capital Stock, the Issuers will not be required to disclose any information or take any actions that, in the
good faith view of the Issuers, would violate the securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise
have an adverse effect on such initial public offering.

If the Issuers have designated any of their Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuers, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses
(1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of
such Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) none of the Issuers nor any Reporting Entity will be required to furnish
any information, certificates or reports that would otherwise be required by (i) Section 302 or Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, or (ii) Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-generally accepted accounting principles financial measures
contained therein, (b) such reports will not be required to contain financial information required by Rule 3-09,
Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or include any exhibits or certifications required by Form 10-K or
Form 10-Q (or any such successor or comparable forms) or related rules under Regulation S-K, and (c) such
reports shall be subject to exceptions, exclusions and other differences consistent with the presentation of
financial and other information in this offering memorandum and shall not be required to present compensation
or beneficial ownership information.

The financial statements, information and other documents required to be provided as described above, may
be those of (i) the Company or (ii) any direct or indirect parent of the Company (any such entity described in

78


-----

clause (i) or (ii), a “Reporting Entity”), so long as in the case of (ii) such direct or indirect parent of the Company
will not conduct, transact or otherwise engage, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage, in any
business or operations other than its direct or indirect ownership of all of the Equity Interests in, and its
management of the Company; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such direct or
indirect parent of the Company, the same is accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the quantitative
differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the
Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

In addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuers will make available to the holders,
prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the notes and securities analysts the
information required to be provided pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) of this paragraph, by posting such
information to the website of the Company (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Company) or on
IntraLinks or any comparable online data system or website.

The Issuers have agreed that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding during any period when they are
not or any Reporting Entity is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or otherwise permitted to
furnish the SEC with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, they will furnish to the
holders of the notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. The Issuers will also hold quarterly conference calls,
beginning with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date, for all holders of the notes, prospective
investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the notes and securities analysts to discuss such
financial information no later than ten business days after the distribution of such information required by clauses
(1) or (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, and prior to the date of each such conference call, the Issuers
will announce the time and date of such conference call and either include all information necessary to access the
call in such announcement or inform holders of notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any
initial purchaser of the notes and securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without
limitation, the applicable password or other login information (if applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above
to the Trustee and the holders if an Issuer or a Reporting Entity has filed such reports with the SEC via the
EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such reports are publicly available. In addition, the
requirements of this covenant shall be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would be required to be
provided to the holders on the Company’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the
Company).

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is not
an Excluded Subsidiary and that guarantees or becomes a borrower under the First Lien Credit Agreement or that
guarantees any other Indebtedness of either Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to execute and deliver to
the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of
the notes and (ii) joinders to or new Security Documents and take all actions required by the Security Documents
to perfect the Liens created thereunder.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such
Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be released in accordance
with the provisions of the indenture described under “—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The indenture will provide that the Company may not, directly or indirectly, consolidate, amalgamate or
merge with or into or wind up or convert into, consummate a Delaware LLC Division (whether or not the

79


-----

Company is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division, merger, winding up or conversion (if other than the Company)
or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made
is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (the
Company or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); provided
that in the event that the Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the notes is a
corporation;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the obligations of the
Company under the indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to supplemental indentures or
other applicable documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be no less than such ratio immediately prior to such
transaction;

(5) if the Company is not the Successor Company, each Subsidiary Guarantor, unless it is the other party to
the transactions described above, shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Subsidiary
Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the indenture and the notes; and

(6) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental
indentures (if any) comply with the indenture.

The Successor Company (if other than the Company) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company
under the indenture, the notes and the Security Documents, and in such event the Company will automatically be
released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture, the notes and the Security Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may merge,
consolidate or amalgamate with or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary, and
(b) the Company may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in another state of the United States, the District of Columbia or
any territory of the United States (collectively, a “Permitted Jurisdiction”) or may convert into a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby. This “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets” will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets
between or among the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant
to Permitted Securitization Financings.

80


-----

The indenture will further provide that, subject to certain provisions in the indenture governing release of
the Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantee and release of assets and property securing the notes upon the sale or
disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is the Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor, none of the Co-Issuer or
any Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Company will not permit the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to,
consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a Delaware LLC Division (whether
or not the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any
Person unless:

(1) either (a) the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving Person or the Person
formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, Delaware LLC Division or merger (if
other than the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation (in the case of the Co-Issuer) or a
company, corporation, partnership or limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof
(the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor”), and the Successor (if other than the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) expressly
assumes all the obligations of the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture, the notes
and the Security Documents or the Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental
indenture or other applicable documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, or
(b) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is not in violation of the covenant
described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales”; and

(2) the Successor (if other than the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused
to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with
the indenture.

Subject to certain provisions described in the indenture, the Successor (if other than the Co-Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor under
the indenture, the notes and the Security Documents or the Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, and the
Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under
the indenture and the notes or its Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the
Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely
for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Subsidiary Guarantor in a Permitted Jurisdiction or (other
than the Co-Issuer) may convert into a limited liability company, corporation, partnership or similar entity
organized or existing under the laws of any Permitted Jurisdiction so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the
Co-Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor is not increased thereby and (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate, amalgamate or merge
with or into or wind up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of its properties or assets to an Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor.

**Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will be defined in the indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any note when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its Stated Maturity,
upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuers for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the holders of
not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to the

81


-----

Trustee) to comply with any of their obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the provisions
of the indenture described in “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”;

(4) the failure by any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice given by the
Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding
(with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with its other obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a
default referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) contained in the notes or the indenture;

(5) the failure by any Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization
Subsidiary) (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other
than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay any Indebtedness for borrowed money
(other than Indebtedness owing to an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Permitted Securitization
Financing) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such
Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such
Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $100 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of an Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
(other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Subsidiaries that together
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than a Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary);

(7) failure by an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization
Subsidiary) (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other
than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
$100 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable
insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed
for a period of 60 days;

(8) the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) with respect to the notes ceases to be in full force and effect (except as
contemplated by the terms thereof) or an Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) denies or
disaffirms its obligations under the indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the notes
(except as contemplated by the terms thereof) and such Default continues for 10 days;

(9) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents or
the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Liens in favor of the holders of the notes with
respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable and such Default
continues for 30 days; or

(10) the failure by any Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other
agreements contained in the Security Documents or the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreements except for a failure that would not be material to the holders of the notes and would not
materially affect the value of the Collateral taken as a whole.

Each of the foregoing will constitute an Event of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default
and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree
or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (10) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuers, with a copy to the Trustee,
of the default and the Issuers do not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (10) after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuers or the holders of at least

82


-----

30% in principal amount of outstanding notes by notice to the Issuers, with a copy to the Trustee, may declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable; provided,
_however, that so long as any Bank Indebtedness remains outstanding, no such acceleration shall be effective until_
the earlier of (1) five Business Days after the giving of written notice to the Issuers and the administrative agent
under the First Lien Credit Agreement and (2) the day on which any Bank Indebtedness is accelerated. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of an Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on all the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of
outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of
Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled,
waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within
20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that
(x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the
holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to
such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being
understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the notes as described above be
annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events.

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the indenture or the notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing,

(2) holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy,

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense,

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security or indemnity, and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a
direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under
the indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all
losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer
or the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder of the notes, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, notice
of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer
or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,

83


-----

premium (if any) or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In addition, the Issuers are required to
deliver to the Trustee, annually, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Issuers are also required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuers are taking or propose to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture, the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Security Documents
and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended with the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding and any past default or compliance with any
provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then
outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note affected, no amendment may:

(1) reduce the amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any note;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the dates on which any such

any Subsidiary Guarantor;

(7) impair the contractual right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on such holder’s note on or after the due dates thereof or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to such holder’s note;

(8) make any change in the amendment provisions or in the waiver provisions which require each holder’s
consent; or

(9) make any change to the provisions of the indenture, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents with respect to the pro rata application of proceeds of Collateral
in respect of the notes that results in the application of such proceeds in respect of the notes on a less
than pro rata basis to the holder of any note.

Except as expressly provided by the indenture, the Security Documents or the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, without the consent of the holders of at least 66.67% in an aggregate principal amount
of the notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may release all or substantially all of the Collateral from
the Lien of the indenture and the Security Documents with respect to the notes.

Without the consent of any holder, the Issuers, the Trustee and/or the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent
may amend the indenture, the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Security Documents or the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) to
provide for the assumption by a Successor Company (with respect to an Issuer) of the obligations of an Issuer
under the indenture, the notes, the Security Documents and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement;
(3) to provide for the assumption by a Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (with respect to any Subsidiary
Guarantor), as the case may be, of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture, the notes, its
Subsidiary Guarantee, the Security Documents and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement; (4) to
provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes (provided that the uncertificated
notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the

84


-----

uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code); (5) to add a Subsidiary Guarantee or
collateral with respect to the notes, to release or subordinate Collateral as not prohibited by the indenture, the
Security Documents or the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to add additional secured creditors
holding First Priority Lien Obligations, Other Second Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations so long as
such obligations are not prohibited by the indenture or the Security Documents; (6) [reserved]; (7) to add to the
covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuers; (8) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuers);
(9) to conform the text of the indenture, the notes, Subsidiary Guarantees, the Security Documents or the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement to any provision of this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such
provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended by the Issuers to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of
the indenture, Subsidiary Guarantees, the notes, the Security Documents or the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, as stated in an Officer’s Certificate; (10) to comply with any requirement
of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the indenture under the TIA (if the Issuers elect to qualify the
indenture under the TIA); (11) to effect any provision of the indenture; (12) to make certain changes to the
indenture to provide for the issuance of additional notes; or (13) to add provisions to the indenture and a new
form of note to permit the issuance by the Issuers or a Subsidiary thereof of escrow notes under the indenture,
which may have different terms than other notes issued under the indenture so long as the proceeds of such notes
remain in escrow (including, but not limited to, collateral, different or no guarantees and redemption provisions).

The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Managers and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator or holder of any Equity Interests in either Issuer or
any direct or indirect parent companies, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of either Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor under the notes, the indenture or the Subsidiary Guarantees, as applicable, or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a
note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. Upon any transfer or
exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuers may require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law
or permitted by the indenture. The Issuers are not required to transfer or exchange any notes selected for
redemption or to transfer or exchange any notes for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of notes to be
redeemed. The notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a note will be treated as the
owner of such note for all purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights and
immunities of the Trustee and rights of registration or transfer or exchange of notes, as expressly provided for in
the indenture) as to all outstanding notes when:

(1) either (a) all the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed notes
which have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited
in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged
from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes not delivered

85


-----

to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at
their stated maturity within one year or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Issuers, are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers, and the Issuers have
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit (in the
case of notes that have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as
applicable, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuers directing the Trustee to apply such
funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be; provided that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal
to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of
the date of the redemption only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of the
redemption;

(2) the Issuers and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors have paid all other sums payable under the indenture; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that
all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture
have been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all of its obligations under the notes and the indenture with respect to
the holders of the notes (“legal defeasance”), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the notes. The Issuers at any time
may terminate their obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” for the benefit of the
holders of the notes, the operation of clauses (3), (4), (5), (6) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8),
(9) and (10) under “—Defaults” and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and
“—Certain Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”
(“covenant defeasance”) for the benefit of the holders of the notes. If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance
option or their covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations
with respect to the notes, its Subsidiary Guarantee and the Security Documents.

The Issuers may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior exercise of their covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuers exercise their covenant defeasance
option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4),
(5), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8), (9) or (10) under “—Defaults” or because of the
failure of the Issuers to comply with clause (4) under “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets.”

In order to exercise their defeasance option, the Issuers must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium (if any)_
and interest on the notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the notes will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law); provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the

86


-----

Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of the redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not be delivered if all of the notes not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers.

**Registration Rights**

The Issuers will not be obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the
resale of the notes or to register the exchange of the notes under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of
any jurisdiction. The indenture will not be qualified under the TIA and the Issuers will not be required to comply
with the provisions of the TIA. The absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the
notes.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent**

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association will be the Trustee and Second Lien Notes Collateral Agent under
the indenture and will be appointed by the Issuers as registrar and a paying agent with regard to the notes.

“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of EBITDA of
such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period. In the event that the Issuers or

case of any Permitted Securitization Financing, in which case interest expense shall be computed based upon the
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period) or issues, repurchases or redeems
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such
issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) and any
operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations
that the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary have determined to make and/or made during the four-quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed
Charge Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a “pro forma event”) shall be calculated on a pro
forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations,
consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational changes, business realignment projects or
initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations (and the change of any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged with or into an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period
shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued
operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or
reorganization that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business
realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable four-quarter period. If since the beginning of such period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated
an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuers. Any
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of
the Issuers, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost
savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event, and (2) all adjustments of the nature used in

101


-----

connection with the calculation of “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC)” as set forth in the offering
memorandum for the notes to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such
four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness
under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered
rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon
such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in giving effect to each New Project which
commences operations and records not less than one full fiscal quarter’s operations during such period, the
operating results of such New Project shall be annualized on a straight line basis during such period, taking into
account any seasonality adjustments determined by the Issuers in good faith.

For purposes of this definition, any amount in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S.
dollars based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the most recent twelve month period
immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner consistent with that used in calculating EBITDA for
the applicable period.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of:
(1) Consolidated Interest Expense (excluding amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs) of such
Person for such period, and (2) all cash dividend payments (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any
series of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

“Foreign Subsidiary” means a Restricted Subsidiary not organized or existing under the laws of the United
States of America or any state thereof or the District of Columbia.

“GAAP” means generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time in the United States set
forth in the statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in such other
statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession;
_provided, however, that if the Issuers notify the Trustee that the Issuers request an amendment to any provision_
hereof to eliminate the effect of any change in accounting principles or change as a result of the adoption or
modification of accounting policies occurring after the Issue Date in GAAP or in the application thereof on the
operation of such provision, regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP
or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and
applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn
or such provision amended in accordance with this definition. The Issuers will give notice of any such election
made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election
(without any other action) referred to in this definition will not (1) be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness or
(2) have the effect of rendering invalid any Restricted Payment, Investment, Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens
or other action made prior to the date of such election (or any other action conditioned on the Issuers and the

102


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries having been able to incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness or compliance with any other
ratio, basket or covenant set forth herein) if such Restricted Payment, Investment, Incurrence or other action was
not in violation of the indenture on the date made, incurred or taken, as the case may be. For the purposes of the
indenture, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person shall mean such Person consolidated with its
Restricted Subsidiaries, and shall not include any Unrestricted Subsidiary, but the interest of such Person in an
Unrestricted Subsidiary will be accounted for as an Investment.

“guarantee” means a guarantee (other than by endorsement of negotiable instruments for collection in the
ordinary course of business), direct or indirect, in any manner (including, without limitation, letters of credit and
reimbursement agreements in respect thereof), of all or any part of any Indebtedness or other obligations. The

reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such person in good faith.

“Hedge Bank” shall mean any person that, at the time it enters into a Hedging Agreement, or on the date of

repurchase transaction, securities lending transaction, weather index transaction, spot contracts, fixed price
physical delivery contracts, or any similar transaction or any combination of these transactions, in each case of

the time it becomes a Subsidiary.

“Indebtedness” means, with respect to any Person:

(3) to the extent not otherwise included, Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on any asset

determined in good faith by the Issuers) of such asset at such date of Incurrence, and (b) the amount of

interpretations to the extent such effects would otherwise increase or decrease an amount of Indebtedness for any
purpose under the indenture as a result of accounting for any embedded derivatives created by the terms of such

Subsidiary (other than a Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary)).

“Pro Forma EBITDA” means, with respect to any Person, at any date, the EBITDA of such Person for the

date, subject to the following adjustments. In the event that an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, repays,
repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the period for which Pro Forma
EBITDA is being calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of Pro Forma EBITDA is made (the
“Pro Forma EBITDA Calculation Date”), then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to
such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or
redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

115


-----

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) and any
operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations
that an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has determined to make and/or made during the four-quarter reference
period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Pro Forma EBITDA
Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a “pro forma event”) shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations,
discontinued operations and other operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects,
restructurings or reorganizations (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If since the
beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or
into an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued operation, operational change,
business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization that would have required
adjustment pursuant to this definition, then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro forma effect
thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project,
restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. If since the
beginning of such period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted
Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuers. Any
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of
the Issuers, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost
savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event, and (2) all adjustments of the nature used in
connection with the calculation of “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC)” as set forth in the offering
memorandum for the notes to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such
four-quarter period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Pro Forma EBITDA Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness
under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Secured Leverage Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness
under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered

event that an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, repays, repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is being calculated
but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is made (the “Senior

forma effect to such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance,
repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if the same had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,

shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued
operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or
reorganization that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, discontinued operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business
realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable four-quarter period. If since the beginning of such period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated
an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuers. Any

accounting officer of the Issuers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness

balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered
rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon
such optional rate chosen as the Issuers may designate.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership
and disposition of the Notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below and collectively
referred to as “Holders”) of the Notes. The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury regulations, rulings, administrative pronouncements
and judicial decisions as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time with possible retroactive effect. We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described
below, and as a result no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this
summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all of the possible tax consequences of the
acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes and does not address all tax consequences that might be
relevant to particular Holders in light of their personal circumstances. In particular, this summary deals only with
Holders that acquire the Notes pursuant to this offering at the issue price set forth on the cover of this information
memorandum and will hold the Notes as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any
state, local or non-U.S. government that may be applicable to a particular Holder and does not consider any
aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation. This summary does not address U.S. federal
alternative minimum tax consequences. In addition, this summary does not apply to Holders that may be subject
to special tax rules, such as dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies, financial institutions, mutual
funds or “financial services entities,” banks, thrifts, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real
estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, entities or arrangements treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as partnerships, S corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings
to avoid U.S. federal income tax, retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts, persons that hold Notes as a
part of a hedge, straddle, conversion transaction, constructive sale or other arrangement involving more than one
position, U.S. expatriates, persons that are required to report income no later than when such income is reported
in an “applicable financial statement” and investors who receive Notes as compensation. This summary also does
not address tax consequences to Holders (as defined below) as a result of using a “functional currency” that is not
the U.S. dollar.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is: (a) an individual who
is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (b) a corporation (or other
business entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (c) an estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d) a trust (A) if a court within the United
States can exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all of its substantial decisions or (B) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S. Holder”
means a beneficial owner of Notes that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate
or trust and is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes).

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a
partner in or other owner of the entity will generally depend upon the status of the partner or other owner and the
activities of the entity. A partner in or other owner of such an entity is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding
the tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

**The discussion set out below is intended only as a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax**
**consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Holders are urged to consult their**
**tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including**

126


-----

**the application to their particular situation of the tax consequences discussed below, as well as the**
**application of other federal tax laws and state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. The discussion set out below is**
**based on the laws and regulations in force and interpretations thereof as of the date hereof, which are**
**subject to changes occurring after the date hereof.**

**Notes Subject to Contingencies**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Notes—
Payment of Additional Amounts”), we may be obligated to pay Holders additional amounts in excess of stated
interest or principal on the Notes. It is possible that our obligation to make additional payments on the Notes
could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” If the
Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt instruments, Holders might, among other things, be
required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat any gain
recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.

We intend to take the position that the likelihood of additional payments on the Notes is remote, and thus,
that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination that these
contingencies are remote is binding on a Holder unless it discloses its contrary position in the manner required by
applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to
challenge this determination, a Holder might be required to include in gross income an amount of ordinary
interest income on the Notes in excess of the stated interest, and a Holder might be required to treat income
realized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain. In the event a
contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of income recognized by a Holder. If any contingent
amounts are in fact paid, a Holder will be required to recognize such amounts as income.

The remainder of this disclosure assumes that our determination that the contingencies are remote is correct.
The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of
authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the Treasury regulations is not certain. Holders are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to
the Notes.

**Tax Consequences for U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Each payment of qualified stated interest on a Note (including any amount withheld as backup withholding
tax) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is received, in
accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

_General_

A note with a term that exceeds one year will constitute a discount note issued with OID if the stated
redemption price at maturity of the note exceeds its issue price by more than the de minimis amount of [1]⁄4 of
1 percent of the “stated redemption price at maturity” multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue
date of the note to its maturity. A note’s “issue price” generally is the first price at which a substantial amount of
notes included in the issue of which the note is a part is sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. The
“stated redemption price at maturity” of a note is the total of all payments provided by the note that are not
payments of “qualified stated interest.” Generally, an interest payment on a note is “qualified stated interest” if it
is one of a series of stated interest payments on a note that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a
single fixed rate, with certain exceptions for lower rates paid during some periods, applied to the outstanding
principal amount of the note.

127


-----

It is not expected that the Notes will be issued with OID. If, however, the stated redemption price of a Note
exceeds its issue price by more than a de minimis amount, a U.S. Holder will be required to treat such excess
amount as OID, which is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as accruing over the term of the Note as
interest income to such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note would be increased by the
amount of any OID included in such U.S. Holder’s gross income. In compliance with Treasury regulations, if we
determine that the Notes have OID, we will provide certain information to the IRS and/or U.S. Holders that is
relevant to determining the amount of OID in each accrual period.

_Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method)_

A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on its Note using the constant
yield method, with the modifications described below. For purposes of this election, interest will include
qualified stated interest, OID, de minimis OID and unstated interest. If a U.S. Holder makes this election for its
Note, then, when such U.S. Holder applies the constant yield method: the issue price of its Note will be equal to
its cost; the issue date of such U.S. Holder’s Note will be the date such U.S. Holder acquired the Note; and no
payments on the Note will be treated as payments of qualified stated interest. Generally, this election will apply
only to the Note for which a U.S. Holder makes the election. A U.S. Holder may not revoke an election to apply
the constant yield method to all interest on a Note without the consent of the IRS.

**_Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, retirement or other disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference between the sum of cash and the fair market value of any property received (other
than any amounts allocated to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest
income to the extent not previously so taxed) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be equal to the cost of the Note, decreased (but not below
zero) by any payment previously received other than qualified stated interest payments. Any gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Notes
exceeds one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note. If the
holding period for the Note is one year or less at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Note, any capital gain or loss generally will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Longterm capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for
reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Additional Tax on Passive Income_**

Certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds are
required to pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on, among other things, interest income and capital gains from the
sale or other disposition of notes, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult
their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of principal of, and interest
and accruals of OID on, a Note, and any proceeds of the disposition of a Note before maturity, to a U.S. Holder
other than certain exempt recipients, such as corporations. A U.S. Holder may also be subject to backup
withholding (currently at the rate of 24%) with respect to payments of interest and the gross proceeds received
pursuant to a disposition unless the U.S. Holder is (i) a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when required,
establishes this exemption or (ii) provides its correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that it is not
currently subject to backup withholding tax and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup
withholding tax rules. A U.S. Holder that does not provide its correct taxpayer identification number may be
subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld

128


-----

under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against the U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided, that the required information is furnished to the IRS
in a timely manner. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of backup
withholding to their particular situation, the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**Tax Consequences for Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding (“—Information Reporting and Backup
Withholding”) and any application of FATCA (as defined below, “—FATCA”), payments of interest on a Note
to a Non-U.S. Holder that are not effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or
business within the United States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or any withholding tax,
if:

       - such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Issuer’s voting
stock;

       - such Non-U.S. Holder is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a controlled foreign
corporation related, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer through stock ownership under applicable
rules of the Code;

       - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

       - the certification requirement, as described below, is fulfilled with respect to the beneficial owner
of the Note.

The certification requirement referred to above will be fulfilled if either (A) a Non-U.S. Holder provides to
us or our paying agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form), signed under
penalties of perjury, that includes its name and address and a certification as to its non-U.S. status, or (B) a
securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary
course of its trade or business holds the Note on behalf of the beneficial owner and provides a statement to us or
our paying agent, signed under penalties of perjury, in which the organization, bank or financial institution
certifies that it has received an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form) from the
non-U.S. beneficial owner or from another financial institution acting on behalf of such beneficial owner and
furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof and otherwise complies with the applicable IRS
requirements. Other methods might be available to satisfy the certification requirements described above,
depending on the Non-U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances.

The gross amount of payments of interest that do not qualify for the exception from withholding described
above (the “portfolio interest exemption”) will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless (A) a
Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or successor
form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under an applicable tax treaty, or (B) such interest
is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States and
such Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form).

**_Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_**

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and if interest on the Note or gain
realized on the disposition of the Note is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, such
Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the interest or gain on a net basis
in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an applicable treaty provides

129


-----

otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject
to a branch profits tax on its earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments, at a rate of
30% unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Even though such effectively connected income is
subject to income tax, and may be subject to the branch profits tax, it is not subject to withholding tax if such
Non-U.S. Holder satisfies the certification requirements described above.

**_Sale, Exchange or Disposition of the Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and any application of FATCA (as defined
below), a Non-U.S. Holder of a Note generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized on
the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of such Note (other than gain that represents accrued but unpaid
interest not previously included in income, in which case the rules regarding interest would apply) unless:

       - such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or

       - such gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
within the United States.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Unless certain exceptions apply, we must report annually to the IRS and to any Non-U.S. Holder any
interest paid to such Non-U.S. Holder during the taxable year. Copies of these information returns may also be
made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or other agreement to the tax authorities of the country in
which a Non-U.S. Holder resides.

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, backup withholding tax will not apply to payments of interest by
us or our paying agent on a Note if the certifications described above under “ —Payments of Interest” are
received, provided that we or our paying agent, as the case may be, do not have actual knowledge or reason to
know that the payee is a U.S. person.

The gross proceeds from a sale, exchange or other disposition of a Note by a Non-U.S. Holder made to or
through a foreign office of a foreign broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information
reporting. However, if such broker is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: a U.S. person; a controlled foreign
corporation; a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business for a specified three- year period; or a foreign partnership with certain connections to the United States,
then information reporting will be required unless the broker has in its records documentary evidence that the
beneficial owner is not a U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or the beneficial owner otherwise
establishes an exemption. Backup withholding at the applicable rate, currently 24%, may apply to any payment
that such broker is required to report if the broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the payee is a
U.S. person. Payments to or through the U.S. office of a broker will be subject to backup withholding and
information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person,
or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A Non-U.S. Holder may
obtain a refund or a credit against such Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability of any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information
reporting and backup withholding rules in their particular situations, the availability of an exemption therefrom,
and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if available.

**_FATCA_**

Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial institutions (which
include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and any other
investment vehicles) and certain other foreign entities must comply with information reporting rules with respect

130


-----

to their U.S. account holders and investors or confront a withholding tax on U.S. source payments made to them
(whether received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). More specifically, a foreign
financial institution or other foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA reporting requirements will
generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any “withholdable payments.” For this purpose,
withholdable payments include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax and,
subject to the discussion of the proposed Treasury Regulations below, the entire gross proceeds from the sale or
other disposition of certain equity or debt instruments of U.S. issuers. This withholding tax will apply to a
non-compliant foreign financial institution regardless of whether the payment would otherwise be exempt from
U.S. nonresident withholding tax (e.g., under the portfolio interest exemption or gain realized by a Non-U.S.
Holder on the taxable disposition of a Note). This withholding tax will not apply to withholdable payments made
directly to foreign governments, international organizations, foreign central banks of issue and individuals, and
the IRS is authorized to provide additional exceptions.

Withholding under FATCA will generally apply to payments of interest on a Note to foreign financial
institutions that are not in compliance with FATCA. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued proposed
regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the U.S. federal withholding tax of 30%
applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or disposition of debt instruments. In its preamble to the proposed
regulations, the U.S. Treasury stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final
regulations are issued.

If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax
discussed above, the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such other
withholding tax. Foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have entered into intergovernmental agreements
with the United States in connection with FATCA may be subject to different rules.

**Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the effect of U.S. federal, state,**
**local and non-U.S. income tax laws, as well as treaties, with regard to an investment in the Notes, including**
**any reporting requirements.**

131


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance
on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). Notes offered hereby also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, Notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $1,000. Notes
offered hereby will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form without
interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented
by one or more temporary notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation
S Temporary Global Notes”). The global notes will be deposited upon issuance with the trustee as custodian for
DTC, in New York, New York, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Through and including the 40th day after
the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including
such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be
held only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme
(“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a
Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. After the expiration
of the Restricted Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent
notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Permanent Global
Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”; the
Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes collectively being the “Global Notes”) upon delivery
to the trustee of certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes and pursuant to
Regulation S as provided in the indenture governing the Notes. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global
Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the
limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges between Regulation S notes and Rule 144A notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for notes in certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchange
of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes.” Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes (as
defined herein).

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Notice to Investors.” In addition,
transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC
and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which may
change from time to time.

Initially, the trustee will act as paying agent and registrar. The Notes may be presented for registration of
transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar.

**Certain Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to change by them from time to time. We take no responsibility for these
operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these
matters.

132


-----

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book- entry changes in accounts of its
Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities, such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).

Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through
the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in,
each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect
Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, (i) upon deposit of the Global Notes,
DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchaser with portions of the principal
amount of the Global Notes and (ii) ownership of such interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the
transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if they are Participants
in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants
in such system. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be
subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may
also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain
persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on
behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of a
person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack
of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered
owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture
governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, we and the trustee will treat the
persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners thereof for the
purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the
trustee nor any of our or the trustee’s agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of
DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s
records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the
Global Notes or (ii) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or
Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of
securities, such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant
Participants with the payment on the payment date, in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in the
principal amount of beneficial interest in the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC unless DTC has
reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect
Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices

133


-----

and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of
DTC, the trustee or us. Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants or
indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and we and the trustee may conclusively
rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Except for trades involving Euroclear and Clearstream participants, interests in the Global Notes are
expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and secondary market trading
activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately available funds, subject in all cases to the rules and
procedures of DTC and its Participants. See “—Same-Day Settlement and Payment.” Subject to the transfer
restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in
accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, crossmarket
transfers between the Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the
other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance
with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to
its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests
in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or
Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture
governing the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such Notes to its Participants.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform the foregoing
procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and in the Rule 144A Global Notes
among Participants in DTC, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor
any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules
and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Book-Entry Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive Notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) if
(i) DTC (x) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and we
thereupon fail to appoint a successor depositary or (y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a default or event of default with respect to the
Notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon request
but only upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture
governing the Notes, and in accordance with the certification requirements set forth in the indenture governing
the Notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests
therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
DTC (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in
“Notice to Investors,” unless we determine otherwise in compliance with applicable law.

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be
exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such exchange occurs in connection with
a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate
(in the form provided in the indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule
144A, purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States
and other jurisdictions. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the
Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or
904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available).

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for a beneficial
interest in a Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated
by the trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any
such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or
vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in
such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in such other Global Note
for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial
interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the applicable indenture certifying that
the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a
U.S. person that has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements
under the Securities Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the trustee (or the
paying agent if other than the trustee) a certificate in the form required by the applicable indenture, prior to any
exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same-Day Settlement and Payment**

Payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global
Note holder. With respect to any Notes in certificated form, we will make all payments of principal, premium, if
any, and interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof
or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The Notes
represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement
System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to
be settled in immediately available funds.

135


-----

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a
Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant in DTC will be received with
value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account
only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act), (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act or (v) to us or any of our subsidiaries, in each of cases (i) through (v) in

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) among
the Issuers, the guarantors and Barclays Capital Inc., we have agreed to sell to the initial purchaser, and the initial
purchaser has agreed to purchase from us all of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchaser to pay for and accept delivery
of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The initial purchaser has agreed to resell the Notes (a) in the United States to persons who they reasonably
believe are QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in compliance with Regulation S, in each case, under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.”
The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the
Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the initial
purchaser. The initial purchaser reserves the right to reject an order of Notes in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchaser against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchaser may be
required to make in respect thereof.

We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, issue, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by us and having a
maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any of such debt securities, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale,
issuance, pledge or disposition without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc. for a period of 60 days
after the date of this offering memorandum.

The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes
may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the
Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this
offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop
and continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any national
securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchaser
has advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. The initial purchaser is not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market
making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchaser. In addition, marketmaking activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2020
which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes, or “T+ .” Under Rule
15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days,
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes
on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the
Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next
succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchaser has agreed that it will not offer, sell
or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part of their distribution at
any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering. The initial purchaser will send to any

140


-----

dealer to whom they sell Notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, United States
persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area (“EEA”)**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus
Directive”).

Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Market Act 200 (the “FSMA”)) received by it in connection
with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to us; and

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to such Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Notes will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Therefore, this
offering memorandum may not comply with the disclosure standards of the listing rules (including any additional
listing rules or prospectus schemes) of the SIX Swiss Exchange. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered to
the public in or from Switzerland, but only to a selected and limited circle of investors who do not subscribe to
the Notes with a view to distribution. Any such investors will be individually approached by the initial purchaser
from time to time.

securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a
non-Canadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the
initial purchaser is not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Singapore**

This offering memorandum has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. Accordingly, this offering memorandum and any other document or material in connection with the
offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the Notes have not and may not be circulated or
distributed, nor may the Notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or
purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional investor under
Section 274 of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the “SFA”), (ii) to a relevant person

with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA or (iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the
conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA, in each case subject to compliance with conditions set

Where the Notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person which is:
(a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)), the sole business of
which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of
whom is an accredited investor; or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose

**Stabilization**

In connection with the offering, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the initial purchaser may bid for and
purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The initial purchaser may also overallot
the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover
the syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchaser may bid for and purchase Notes in market making
transactions and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The initial purchaser is not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchaser or any of its affiliates from time to time has provided in the past and may provide in
the future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the

143


-----

ordinary course of business for which they have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees, expenses
and commissions. In the ordinary course of its various business activities, the initial purchaser or one of its
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for its own account and for the accounts of
its customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuers and/or the Company. The initial purchaser or its affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any
time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

An affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. acts as administrative agent under the First Lien Credit Agreement and
