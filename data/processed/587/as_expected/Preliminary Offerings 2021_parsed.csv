587,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.1,Adjusted EBITDA,1100.1.1,,"We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to our operations. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets iv ----- and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs, net, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments, and (xii) other charges and non-cash items. There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118
587,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.2,Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC),1100.2.1,,"We believe that the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted to exclude the effect of our subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”). Additionally, we present Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (PreSAC), which is used in the indentures governing our First Lien Credit Agreement and our Second-Priority Notes, as a supplemental measure of our performance and ability to service debt and incur additional debt. We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our statement of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment (expensed net SAC). There are material limitations to using Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs, which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118
587,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.3,Free Cash Flow,1100.3.1,,"We believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network; subscriber system asset expenditures; and purchases of property and equipment. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP. v -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,118
587,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.4,Adjusted Free Cash Flow,1100.4.1,,"We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to (i) net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, (ii) financing and consent fees, (iii) restructuring and integration, (iv) integration related capital expenditures, (v) radio conversion costs, and (vi) other payments or receipts that may mask our operating results or business trends. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash flow attributable to our normal business activities, inclusive of the net cash flows associated with the acquisition of subscribers, as well as our ability to repay other debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Adjusted Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Adjusted Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. During the second quarter of 2020, Free Cash Flow before special items was renamed Adjusted Free Cash Flow to reflect the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, which supports our consumer financing program that launched nationally in 2020. The inclusion of the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility represents the only revision to Free Cash Flow before special items. vi -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

The guarantees will be automatically released upon release of the corresponding guarantees of the First Lien Credit Agreement (except a release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee following a default by the direct obligor of the First Lien Credit Agreement). However, any such released guarantees will be reinstated if the released guarantors are required to subsequently guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement. Ranking ............................................ The Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations and will: - rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations; - rank senior in right of payment to all of our future debt and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; - be effectively senior to all of our future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes; - be equal to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis, including indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, to ----- the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; - be effectively senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a juniorpriority basis, including the Second-Priority Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes; and - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of Prime Borrower’s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the Notes, including our special purpose subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Notes would have ranked (i) effectively pari passu with $7,329 million face value of indebtedness drawn under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, with a further $575 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, without giving effect to the letters of credit, and (ii) effectively senior to the Second-Priority Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Ranking.” As of March 31, 2021, the non-recourse indebtedness of our special purpose subsidiaries to which the Notes would be effectively subordinated was $98 million. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries held approximately 1% of our consolidated assets, with less than 1% of our consolidated total assets attributable to special purpose subsidiaries, and had $98 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Receivables Facility (as defined herein), consisting of non-recourse indebtedness of our special purpose subsidiaries. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, non-guarantor subsidiaries generated less than 1% of our total revenue and less than 1% of our Adjusted EBITDA. Security............................................. The Notes and the related guarantees will be secured by firstpriority security interests in the collateral (which generally includes substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuer and the guarantors) subject to permitted liens and certain exclusions as described herein. The collateral securing the Notes will exclude: (i) certain real property, (ii) motor vehicles, and certain commercial tort claims, (iii) those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such assets would be prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual obligations (including leases, licenses or other agreements, government licenses or state or local license, franchises, charters or authorizations (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the ----- Uniform Commercial Code), (iv) assets to the extent a security interest in such assets could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by Prime Borrower, (v) “intent-to-use” trademark applications until an Amendment to Allege Use or Statement of Use has been filed, (vi) certain securitization assets, (vii) exceptions mutually agreed upon between Prime Borrower and the administrative agent under the First Lien Credit Agreement and (viii) certain other limited assets. For more information on the security granted, see “Description of Notes—Security.” The security interests in the assets securing the Notes may be released under certain circumstances without your consent or the consent of the trustee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes” and “Description of Notes— Release of Collateral.” Intercreditor Agreement...................... The security granted in the collateral to secure the Notes on a first-priority basis also secures, on a first-priority basis, indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will permit us to secure additional indebtedness with liens on the collateral under certain circumstances. Pursuant to an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) to be joined by the Trustee on the Issue Date, the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the holders of the ADT Notes, the holders of the First-Priority Notes and the holders of certain other debt (including certain hedging and cash management counterparties) will receive parity treatment with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the security interest in or other recoveries from the collateral. See “Description of Notes—Security— First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” The Notes will also be subject to an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) that establishes the subordination of the liens securing the Second-Priority Notes to the liens securing the first-priority lien obligations, including the Notes, and certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests. See “Description of Notes—First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” Optional Redemption ......................... The Notes will be subject to redemption at our option on any date prior to the maturity date, in whole or from time to time in part. Prior to            , 2028 (twelve months prior to the maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole” ----- amount, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Par Call Date. On or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Redemption of Notes for Tax Reasons ..................................... We may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes upon the occurrence of specified tax events described under “Description of Notes— Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes.” Change of Control Offer to Repurchase....................................... If (a) a Change of Control as defined under “Description of Notes—Change of Control” occurs and (b) the rating on the Notes is lowered in respect of a Change of Control and the Notes are rated below investment grade by two of three rating agencies (which are Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc.), the Issuer must offer to repurchase the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” Certain Covenants ............................. The indenture governing the Notes will include requirements that will, among other things, restrict the ability of Prime Borrower and its subsidiaries to: - merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets; - create liens on certain assets; and - enter into sale-leaseback transactions. These covenants will be subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations. See “Description of Notes.” Transfer Restrictions; No Registration Rights ............................ The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Notes are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and we will not be required to complete a registered exchange offer or file a shelf registration statement for resales of the Notes. We do not intend to issue registered notes in exchange for the Notes and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There are ----- restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes without registration or the filing of a prospectus under applicable securities laws, and the Notes are not subject to any future registration rights or obligations.” Use of Proceeds ................................ We will use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to (a) redeem $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 ADT Notes and (b) pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.” No Prior Market ................................. The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no public trading market. Although certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained. We do not intend to list or apply to list the Notes on any securities exchange or for quotation through any automated quotation system. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if developed be maintained, for the Notes.” Book-Entry Form ............................... The Notes will be issued in registered book-entry form represented by one or more global notes to be deposited with or on behalf of DTC or its nominee. Transfers of the Notes will only be effected through facilities of DTC. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for certificated notes except in limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.” Additional Notes ................................ From time to time, without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the Notes, the Issuer may issue other debt securities under the indenture governing the Notes in addition to the Notes, increase the principal amount of the Notes that may be issued under the indenture governing the Notes and issue additional Notes in the future. Any additional Notes issued in this manner will have the same terms as the Notes being offered by this offering memorandum but may be offered at a different offering price or have a different issue date, interest accrual date or initial interest payment date than the Notes being offered by this offering memorandum. If issued in this manner, these additional Notes will become part of the same series as the Notes being offered by this offering memorandum, including for purposes of voting, redemptions and offers to purchase. If any additional Notes issued in this manner are issued at a price that causes such additional Notes to have more than a de minimis amount of “original issue discount” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations of the United States Department of Treasury thereunder (the “Code”), such additional Notes may not have the same CUSIP number as the Notes offered by this offering ----- memorandum. The indenture governing the Notes also permit the issuance of additional series of notes having different terms than the Notes. Holders of additional notes issued in this manner will vote with holders of the Notes (except to the extent the amendment affects a provision that is included in only one series of notes). Trustee ............................................. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. Notes Collateral Agent ....................... Barclays Bank PLC. Governing Law .................................. The governing law for the Notes and the indenture is New York. Risk Factors ......................................

Our computations of key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, our operating metric key performance indicators are approximated as there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business. These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversions or historical methodology differences in legacy systems. (2) RMR is generated by contractual recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our customers. We believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under contract at a given point in time. (3) A portion of our customer base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Customers may choose not to renew or may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons, including relocation, cost, loss to competition, or service issues. Gross customer revenue attrition has a direct impact on our financial results, including revenue, operating income, and cash flows. Gross customer revenue attrition is defined as RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer chargebacks and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and DIY customers. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, which is generally thirteen months. Gross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and DIY customers, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period. As of January 1, 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of LifeShield LLC, we began presenting gross customer revenue attrition excluding existing and new DIY customers. As a result, trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition excludes DIY customers for all periods presented in this offering memorandum. For all prior reports covering periods prior to January 1, 2019, trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition included DIY customers. Including DIY customers as of December 31, 2018 rounds to the same percentage as presented in this offering memorandum. (4) Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) are non-GAAP measures that we believe are useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business and to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to our operations. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) provide a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use them for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and ----- comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt, (viii) radio conversion costs, net, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) acquisition related adjustments, and (xii) other charges and non-cash items. We define Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for costs in our statement of operations associated with the acquisition of customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment (expensed net SAC). There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC). Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments, including subscriber acquisition costs, which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The table below reconciles net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-SAC) for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

(e) Represents other income related to $22 million of one-time licensing fees. (f) Represents other charges and non-cash items. During 2020, included recoveries of $10 million associated with notes receivable from a former strategic investment. During 2019, included losses of $10 million associated with notes receivable from a former strategic investment and $6 million associated with an estimated legal settlement, net of insurance. During 2018, included a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third-party that we received as part of a settlement. (g)  Represents expensed costs associated with the acquisition of new customers, net of revenue associated with the sale of equipment. (5) We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network; subscriber system asset expenditures; and purchases of property and equipment. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that our management employs to measure cash that is available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to (i) net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, (ii) financing and consent fees, (iii) restructuring and integration, (iv) integration related capital expenditures, (v) radio conversion costs, net and (vi) other payments or receipts that may mask our operating results or business trends. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash flow attributable to our normal business activities, inclusive of the net cash flows associated with the acquisition of subscribers, as well as our ability to repay other debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Adjusted Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Adjusted Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. During the second quarter of 2020, Free Cash Flow before special items was renamed Adjusted Free Cash Flow to reflect the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility, which supports our consumer financing program that launched nationally in 2020. The inclusion of the net cash flow associated with our consumer receivables facility represents the only revision to Free Cash Flow before special items. The table below reconciles cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes contain, or will contain, restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest.

For example, there are no financial covenants in the indentures. In addition, consistent with the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, should the security interests in a substantial portion of the guarantees or collateral for the Notes become unenforceable, holders will not have the ability to cause us to remedy such defect as the indentures and the Notes will not contain provisions which would render such unenforceability an event of default. As in the ADT Notes and the First-Priority Notes, we will also be entitled to release substantially all of the guarantees and collateral with a majority vote of holders of the Notes under the applicable indenture. In addition, as described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control,” upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, the Issuer is required to offer to all holders the right to redeem their Notes at 101% of their principal amount. However, the definition of the term “Change of Control Triggering Event” is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by us, recapitalizations, reorganizations, ventures, mergers, “going private” or similar transactions by us or our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of your Notes. A change of control transaction under the indenture may only occur if there is either (i) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or (ii) a change in the majority of the voting interest in our business coupled with the acquisition by a third-party of an entitlement to receive more than 50% of our equity distributions or partner allocations. For a change of control triggering event to occur there must be not only a change of control transaction as defined in the indenture, but also a ratings downgrade resulting from such transaction. If we were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes, but would not constitute a change of control triggering event, you would not have any rights to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity, which also would adversely affect your investment. The First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second-Priority Notes require, and other future indebtedness may require, the repurchase or repayment of such indebtedness upon a change of control regardless of whether such indebtedness is downgraded at the time of such change of control.

Additionally, under the First Lien Credit Agreement, a change of control constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings and terminate their commitments to lend under the Revolving Credit Facility. The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the Second-Priority Notes and repayment of borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of Notes or that restrictions in our other debt documents will not allow such repurchases. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.

A court might do so if it found that when the Issuer issued the Notes or the guarantor entered into its guarantee, and, in each case, granted the related security interests, or in some states when payments became due under the Notes or the guarantees, the Issuer or the guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business; 21 ----- - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay; or - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against the Issuer or the guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. The court might also avoid an issuance of Notes or a guarantee or the related security interest, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the Notes or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee, and, in each case, provided the related security interest with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud their creditors. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or its guarantee or the related security interest if the Issuer or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or any guarantee or the related security interest, you would no longer have any claim against the Issuer or the applicable guarantor, or the right to enforce or otherwise benefit from the applicable security interest. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or a guarantor. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to the Issuer’s and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent conveyance or transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply in determining whether the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt. Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. See “—Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to 22 ----- zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors” above. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the Notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and such payment would give the recipient more than it would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of “equitable subordination” if the court determines that (a) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it intends to stop collecting LIBOR rates from banks after 2021. The announcement indicates that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. More recently, on March 5, 2021 the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative. Specifically, this will occur immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings. However, U.S. banking regulators have made clear that U.S.-dollar LIBOR originations should end by no later than December 30, 2021, and that new LIBOR originations prior to that date must provide for an alternative reference rate or a hardwired fallback. In accordance with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), U.S. -dollar LIBOR is expected to be replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities. Further, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. recently announced fallback language for LIBOR-referencing derivatives contracts that also provides for SOFR as the primary replacement rate in the event of a LIBOR cessation. SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed on a daily basis and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate for specified tenors and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. As a result, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such reference rate in underlying contractual arrangements. Although there have been issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether SOFR or any of the other alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. There is currently no definitive successor reference rate to LIBOR and various industry organizations are still working to develop workable transition mechanisms. 23 ----- We are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us. As such, LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition. We have entered into, and in the future we may continue to enter into, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable-rate indebtedness, and any such swaps may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous, or may create additional risks. Given the decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States to bolster the financial markets in response to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have examined our interest rate sensitivity. Certain of our variable rate debt instruments, including our first lien term loan, are subject to a 0.75% floor on interest rate payments. While we have hedged our interest rate exposure to our variable rate debt, our hedging instruments do not include a floor and, accordingly, in this current interest rate environment, any 0.125% decrease in LIBOR rates below 0.75% would result in an increase of approximately $3 million in annualized interest expense on our variable-rate debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps. As a result of the changes in the interest rate environment in response to macroeconomic decline due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $3 billion were no longer highly effective beginning in March 2020. Accordingly, we de-designated the cash flow hedges and the changes in fair value for the period in which these cash flow hedges were no longer highly effective were recognized in interest expense. This may cause ongoing volatility in our reported GAAP results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. No appraisals of any of the collateral have been prepared by us or on behalf of us in connection with this offering. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes, the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the First Lien Credit Agreement (and any additional future 26 ----- pari passu obligations). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes and the ADT Notes, the First-Priority Notes and the First Lien Credit Agreement (and any additional future pari passu obligations) will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed and you will not be entitled to adequate protection of any such under-secured amount. The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

In addition, the collateral securing the Notes will be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, whether arising on or after the date the Notes are issued. The existence of any permitted liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

The liens in the collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Notes Collateral Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the Noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral. For example, with respect to collateral consisting of copyrights held by the Issuer or the guarantors on the issue date, we expect that we will only be required to perfect the Notes Collateral Agent’s security interest in certain registered U.S. copyrights. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, certain intellectual property and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Notes Collateral Agent will not monitor and has no obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests, any such security interests that are perfected after the date of the indenture would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on the closing date were no longer subject to such risk. In addition, even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired in the future, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy case under certain circumstances.

Upon the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given or could be materially delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security or superpriority administrative expense claims if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for any such diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, or the length of any delay in making such payments; - whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given or could be materially delayed). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is to be paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of the collateral to which the holders of the Notes are entitled and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to any shortfall or undercollateralization. The Bankruptcy Code only permits the payment and accrual of post- petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of its collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral. 30 ----- In addition, under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the Notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in possession financing or to the use of the shared collateral to secure that financing, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. Even if such additional actions are taken to perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral, to the extent a security interest in any collateral is not perfected on the issue date of the Notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral.

To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes is not perfected after the issue date of the Notes, we will use our commercially reasonably efforts to have all such security interests perfected within 120 days following the issue date of the Notes. If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after the issue date of the Notes, any security interest in other collateral, or any guarantees delivered after the issue date of the Notes, would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on the issue date (or within 30 days thereof) of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under the Bankruptcy Code if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date (or after 30 days thereof) of the Notes may be treated under the Bankruptcy Code as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing or “antecedent” indebtedness. Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the Notes, including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the Notes are issued, may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a year. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the Notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the Notes had been perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the Notes (as applicable) had been issued, less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy case (or, if applicable, one year), such liens or guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue 31 ----- date of the Notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the issue date (or within 30 days thereof) of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and may be required to return prior payments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

The laws of these states may limit the ability of the trustee and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on the real property collateral and improvements located in such states. State law governs the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property interests that secure debt obligations such as the Notes. Applicable state laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure different from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption after foreclosure.

Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, ADT LLC may receive up to $200 million of financing secured by retail installment contract receivables from transactions involving security systems that were sold under a customer-owned model. During April 2020, ADT LLC amended the Receivables Facility to also permit financing secured by retail installment contract receivables from transactions occurring under a Companyowned model. In March 2021, ADT LLC amended the Receivables Facility to, among other things, extend the revolving period until March 4, 2022, and reduced the LIBOR floor from 1.00% to 0.85%. If the revolving period is not extended, ADT LLC is required to repay the Receivables Facility in a manner consistent with the contractual collections of the underlying retail installment contract receivables. ADT LLC may make voluntary prepayments on the Receivables Facility at any time prior to maturity at par. ADT LLC obtains financing by selling or contributing certain retail installment contract receivables to the Company’s wholly-owned consolidated bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (the “SPE”), which, pursuant to the Receivables Facility, borrows funds secured by the transferred retail installment contract receivables. The SPE is a separate legal entity with its own creditors who will be entitled, prior to and upon the liquidation of the SPE, to be satisfied out of the SPE’s assets prior to any assets in the SPE becoming available to ADT LLC (other than the SPE). Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not available to pay creditors of ADT LLC (other than the SPE), although collections from the transferred retail installment contract receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the SPE’s creditors may be remitted to ADT LLC during and after the term of the Receivables Facility. The SPE’s creditors have legal recourse to the transferred retail installment contract receivables owned by the SPE, but do not have any recourse to ADT LLC (other than the SPE) for the payment of principal and interest on the SPE’s financing. ADT LLC services the transferred retail installment contract receivables and is responsible for ensuring that amounts collected from the transferred retail installment contract receivables are remitted to a segregated bank account in the name of the SPE. ADT LLC is required to deposit payments received from the transferred retail installment contract receivables into a segregated account maintained by a third party. On a monthly basis, the segregated account is utilized to make required principal, interest, and other payments due under the Receivables Facility. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company received proceeds of $30 million under the Receivables Facility and repaid $7 million. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had an outstanding balance of $98 million and an uncommitted available borrowing capacity of $102 million under the Receivables Facility.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will deliver a joinder to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the obligations under the Notes. The First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement governs the relative rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the holders of the Notes, the holders of the ADT Notes, the holders of the First-Priority Notes and the holders of any other First Priority Lien Obligations. Under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the 47 ----- “Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to foreclose on Common Collateral and take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations have no right to so direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent or to take actions with respect to the Common Collateral. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” is currently the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent. The Trustee for the holders of the Notes, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, will initially have no rights to take any action with respect to the Common Collateral under the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First-Priority Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, at the request of the First-Priority Collateral Agent, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security Document (including, without limitation, to release any Liens securing any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations), so long as such amendment is not prohibited by the terms of the documents governing each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations. The First-Priority Collateral Agent may additionally enter into any amendment (and, at the request of the First-Priority Collateral Agent, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security Document solely as such amendment to such Security Document relates to a particular Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, to release Liens securing such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations); provided that any such amendment is in accordance with the documents pursuant to which such Series of First Priority Lien Obligations was incurred and such amendment does not adversely affect the FirstPriority Secured Parties of any other Series. The First Lien Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). From and after the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative, with respect to any Common Collateral, will be the Authorized Representative (the “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”) of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (other than obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to such Common Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). As of the Issue Date, the trustee for the 2026 Notes will be the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,” with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the applicable Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default, under and as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, and (b) the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that Series of First Priority Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Common Collateral (1) at any time the First Lien Credit Agreement Agent or the First-Priority Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Common Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Applicable Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to instruct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral. The First-Priority Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any NonControlling Authorized Representative or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the Applicable 48 ----- Authorized Representative), and no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the First-Priority Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Common Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any Non-Controlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Common Collateral or cause the First-Priority Collateral Agent to do so. Each other Authorized Representative agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Indenture or the agreement governing such other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each of the First-Priority Secured Parties also agreed and the Trustee will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien/ First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any enforcement by the First-Priority Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions thereof, the Liens in favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First-Priority Secured Parties upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged. If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Common Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or received by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First Priority Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First Priority Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the First-Priority Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party (other than a First-Priority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable intercreditor agreements) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Priority Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Common Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to which such impairment exists. 49 ----- None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any other FirstPriority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First-Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the First-Priority Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien/ First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) agrees that it will raise no objection to any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank _pari passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Common Collateral as set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First-Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case, (B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the other First-Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and (D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Priority Secured 50 ----- Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First-Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Priority Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the documents governing each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will execute and deliver a joinder to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of an other First Lien Obligations Agent in respect of the obligations under the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, at any time prior to the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations, the Applicable First Lien Agent and other representatives of the First Priority Lien Obligations will have the exclusive right to enforce rights and exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral subject to other provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. So long as the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Applicable Second Lien Agent will not be permitted to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to the Collateral even if an Event of Default under the indenture governing the Second-Priority Notes has occurred and the Second-Priority Notes have been accelerated, except the Applicable Second Lien Agent may take certain specified permitted remedies, including to: (a) take certain protective measures described in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (b) exercise rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral after a period of 180 days has elapsed since the delivery of the notice of the acceleration of the applicable Second Priority Lien Obligations to the Applicable First Lien Agent, if no holder of First Priority Lien Obligations is diligently pursuing the enforcement or exercise of rights or remedies with respect to a material portion of Collateral or requested a relief of any stay to enable commencement of such exercise, any such acceleration has not been rescinded and neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor is then a debtor in any insolvency proceeding, (c) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding, or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Second Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, 51 ----- (d) file any pleadings, objections motions, or agreements that assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor arising under either any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with or prohibited by the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or applicable law (including the bankruptcy laws of an applicable jurisdiction), or (e) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim, make other filings and make any arguments, obligations, and motions (including in support of or opposition to, as applicable, the confirmation or approval of any plan of reorganization) that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to certain limited rights, the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that it will not take any action that would hinder or interfere with any exercise of remedies undertaken by any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Collateral and waived any and all rights it or any such Second Lien Secured Party may have as a junior lien creditor or otherwise to object to the manner in which any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations seeks to enforce or collect the First Priority Lien Obligations or the Liens granted to secure any First Priority Lien Obligations, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by such holder is adverse to the interests of the holders of the Second Priority Lien Obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if, at any time the Issuer or a Guarantor or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations delivers notice to the Applicable Second Lien Agent that any specified Collateral held by such Person (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof) is disposed of (other than to the Issuer or a Guarantor) (i) by the owner of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the documents governing First Priority Lien Obligations and Second Priority Lien Obligations or (ii) during the existence of any Event of Default under (and as defined in) the First Lien Credit Agreement or any applicable documents governing other First Priority Lien Obligations in connection with any enforcement action, exercise of rights or remedies or to the extent that the Applicable First Lien Agent has consented to such disposition, then the Liens securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and upon, but only to the extent, such Liens on such Collateral securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are released and discharged.

In addition if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of any Second Priority Lien Obligations agreed that: (1) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the First-Priority 52 ----- Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use, sale or lease of cash collateral or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing, then they will not object to, or support any objection to or otherwise contest, and will be deemed to have consented to, such use, sale or lease of such cash collateral and DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by clause 7 below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated or _pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto, including any “carve-out” from the Collateral granting administrative priority status or Lien priority to secure the payment of fees and expenses of the United States Trustee or professionals retained by any debtor or creditors’ committee agreed to by the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or the other holders of First Priority Lien Obligations) and to any adequate protection Liens granted to the First-Priority Collateral Agent, on the same basis as the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated to the Liens securing the DIP Financing; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of the DIP Financing does not exceed the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of the First Priority Lien Obligations (after taking into account any “roll-up” thereof) and (2) an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate commitments (whether drawn or undrawn) under such then existing revolving credit facilities, in each case determined as of the commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding. (2) they will raise no objection to, and will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of any First Priority Lien Obligations made by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations; (3) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any lawful exercise by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations of the right to credit bid the First Priority Lien Obligations under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable Bankruptcy Law) or at any sale in foreclosure or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Collateral or other collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations; (4) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any other request for judicial relief made in any court by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on any Collateral or other Collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations; (5) they will raise no objection to, will not support any objection to or otherwise contest, any order relating to a sale of any Collateral of the Issuer or Guarantor for which the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations has consented that provides, to the extent that the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations and the Second Priority Lien Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations do relate to the Liens securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations in accordance with the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, provided that the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations may assert any objection to the proposed bidding or related sale procedures to be utilized in connection with a sale or disposition that could be asserted by an unsecured creditor in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (6) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they will not (i) seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Collateral or any other collateral securing any First Priority Lien Obligations without the prior written consent of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the required lenders under each Series of First Priority Lien Obligations or are otherwise 53 ----- set forth in the First-Lien/Second-Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) oppose the FirstPriority Collateral Agent or any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations from seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay; (7) none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (a) any request by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations for adequate protection in any form or (b) any objection by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the First-Priority Collateral Agent’s or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations’ claiming a lack of adequate protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent and any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations (A) may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), which Lien or superpriority claim is junior and subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to the Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (B) will not seek or request, without the consent of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or as otherwise set forth in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, adequate protection in any other form, and (ii) in the event that the Applicable Second Lien Agent or any holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent agreed that the holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations shall also be granted a senior Lien on such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the applicable First Priority Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing and/or a superpriority administrative claim (as applicable), and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Second Priority Lien Obligations and/or a superpriority claim shall be junior and subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing, and the claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens granted to the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing, and the claims with respect to, the Second Priority Lien Obligations are so junior and subordinated to such Liens securing, and claims with respect to, the First Priority Lien Obligations under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations shall not be prohibited from seeking and accepting adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Applicable Second Lien Agent and the holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations; and (8) until the Discharge of First Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, they (i) will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar 54 ----- provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Priority Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral or other collateral, and (ii) will waive any claim it may have arising out of the election by any holder of First Priority Lien Obligations of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law). In addition, under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of Second Priority Lien Obligations may support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization proposed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (and shall be deemed to have voted to reject any such plan) unless it (a) pays off, in cash in full, all First Priority Lien Obligations, (b) is accepted by the class of holders of First Priority Lien Obligations voting thereon in accordance with Section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable bankruptcy law), or (c) otherwise provides the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations with the value of the Collateral in cash or otherwise, prior to any payment or distribution on account of the Second Priority Lien Obligations (subject to a certain other provision of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement). The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the parties thereto agree that (i) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents and the security documents governing the Second Priority Lien Obligations constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens and (ii) because of their differing rights in the Collateral, the Second Priority Lien Obligations must be separately classified from the First Priority Lien Obligations in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed or confirmed in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The discussion set out below is based on the laws and regulations in force and interpretations thereof as of the date hereof, which are subject to changes occurring after the date hereof. Notes Subject to Contingencies",2009.2.1,,"In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), we may be obligated to pay Holders additional amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes. It is possible that our obligation to make additional payments on the Notes could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” If the Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt instruments, Holders might, among other things, be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. We intend to take the position that the likelihood of additional payments on the Notes is remote, and thus, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination that these contingencies are remote is binding on a Holder unless it discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to challenge our determination, a Holder might be required to include in gross income an amount of ordinary interest income on the Notes in excess of the stated interest on the Notes, and to treat income realized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain. In the event a contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of income recognized by a Holder. If any contingent amounts are in fact paid, a Holder will be required to recognize such amounts as income. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that our determination that the contingencies are remote is correct. The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the Treasury regulations is not certain.

The “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Notes may exceed the “issue price” of the Notes by more than a de minimis amount. In that case, the Notes will be treated as issued with OID. Following is a summary of the OID rules and their application to the Notes. If a substantial amount of Notes in an issue is issued for money, the “issue price” of a Note in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money (ignoring sales to bond 85 ----- houses, brokers or similar persons acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). A U.S. Holder may obtain the issue price of a Note by contacting us at the address set forth under “Summary—Overview.” The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note generally is the sum of all payments provided by the Note other than “qualified stated interest” payments. Generally, an interest payment on a Note is “qualified stated interest” if it is one of a series of stated interest payments on a Note that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate, with certain exceptions for lower rates paid during some periods, applied to the outstanding principal amount of the Note. Interest is considered unconditionally payable only if reasonable legal remedies exist to compel timely payment or the Note otherwise provides terms and conditions that make the likelihood of late payment (other than a late payment that occurs within a reasonable grace period) or non-payment a remote contingency. Interest is payable at a single fixed rate only if the rate appropriately takes into account the length of the interval between payments. Thus, if the interval between payments varies during the term of a Note, the value of the fixed rate on which a payment is based generally must be adjusted to reflect a compounding assumption consistent with the length of the interval preceding the payment. Notes that have _de minimis OID generally will be treated as not having OID unless a U.S. Holder elects to treat all interest on the Note as OID. See “—Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method).” Because the Notes may be issued with OID, a U.S. Holder may be required to include OID in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues (regardless of its method of accounting), which may be in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to that income. OID accrues under the constant yield method, based on a compounded yield to maturity, as described below. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. The annual amounts of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder will be equal to the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID with respect to a Note for each day on which such U.S. Holder owns the Note during the taxable year. Generally, a U.S. Holder determines the daily portions of OID by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that is allocable to that accrual period. The term “accrual period” means an interval of time with respect to which the accrual of OID is measured. The accrual period may vary in length over the term of a Note provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on either the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will be the excess of (i) the product of (x) the “adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and (y) the “yield to maturity” of the Note over (ii) the aggregate amount of any qualified stated interest payments on the Note that are allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual period is the issue price of the Note, and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any holder, reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) previously made on the Note. If an interval between payments of qualified stated interest on a Note contains more than one accrual period, then, when a U.S. Holder determines the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period, such U.S. Holder must allocate the amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval, including any qualified stated interest that is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately following the interval, pro rata to each accrual period in the interval. In addition, a U.S. Holder must increase the adjusted issue price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval by the amount of any qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the first day of the accrual period but that is not payable until the end of the interval. If all accrual periods are of equal length except for either an initial shorter accrual period or an initial and a final shorter accrual period, a U.S. Holder may compute the amount of OID allocable to the initial accrual period using any reasonable method; however, the OID allocable to the final accrual period will always be the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. 86 ----- _Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount (Constant Yield Method)_ A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on its Note using the constant yield method described above under “—General,” with the modifications described below. For purposes of this election, interest will include qualified stated interest, OID, _de minimis OID and unstated interest. If a U.S. Holder makes this election for its Note, then, when such U.S. Holder applies the constant yield method: the issue price of the Note will be equal to its cost; the issue date of the Note will be the date such U.S. Holder acquired the Note; and no payments on the Note will be treated as payments of qualified stated interest. Generally, this election will apply only to the Note for which a U.S. Holder makes the election. A U.S. Holder may not revoke an election to apply the constant yield method to all interest on a Note without the consent of the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2021,118

The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury regulations, rulings, administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time with possible retroactive effect. We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all of the possible tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes and does not address all tax consequences that might be relevant to particular Holders in light of their personal circumstances.

This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. government that may be applicable to a particular Holder and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation.

This summary also does not address tax consequences to Holders as a result of using a “functional currency” that is not the U.S. dollar. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is: (a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (b) a corporation (or other business entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (c) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d) a trust (i) if a court within the United States can exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to change by them from time to time. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. 91 ----- DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book- entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it, (i) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes and (ii) ownership of such interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Global Notes may hold their interests therein directly through DTC, if they are Participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, we and the trustee will treat the persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the trustee nor any of our or the trustee’s agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or (ii) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities, such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date, in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal amount of beneficial interest in the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or us.

Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Notes to its Participants. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes and in the Rule 144A Global Notes among Participants in DTC, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.

After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the initial purchasers. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject an order of Notes in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by us and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of such debt securities, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, issuance, pledge or disposition without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. on behalf of the initial purchasers, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum. The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited.

Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisors. In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering.
